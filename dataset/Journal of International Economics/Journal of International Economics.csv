The distortion arises because firms are large and able to exercise market power over their local workers. Using a panel dataset of Chinese manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2007, I measure firm-level labor market distortion and examine their evolution following China's trade policy reform in 2001. I find that labor market distortion is pervasive and the trade policy reform has led to a net reduction of the distortion in China's manufacturing sector, with a larger and significant effect working through the liberalization of input tariffs.","The impact of international trade policy on labor market outcomes is a central topic in the international economics literature (Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016)). Although voluminous, most empirical work has been based primarily on the theoretical premise that firms behave competitively in the labor market.==== This premise stands in contrast to a recent empirical labor economics literature which documents that firms possess some degree of market power in the labor market and, thus, can cause distortionary effects on the economy by engaging in non-competitive conduct (see for examples Card et al. (2018), Berger et al. (2022)).==== Since labor market power is closely tied to a firm's performance,which is, in turn, affected by trade, this paper examines whether trade policy can affect competition in the labor market and consequently alter labor market outcomes through this channel.====Providing a compelling answer to this question is difficult for two reasons. First, from a theoretical point of view, it is not obvious how firms, playing the central role as mediators, transmit trade shocks in the product market to the labor market. In the presence of labor market imperfections, characterizing this transmission requires making explicit assumptions about competition structure in ==== product and labor market, the latter of which is often missing in theoretical trade models. Second, from an empirical perspective, a firm's distortion in the labor market is not directly observable and, thus, requires a consistent measurement methodology. This paper offers novel approaches to both problems and provides estimates of the impact of trade policy on a firm's labor market distortion, using Chinese firm-level data and China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 as a historical policy experiment.====Formally, my analysis in this paper delivers three key contributions. I first develop a theoretical framework to formalize the notion of labor market distortion and explain how trade policy can affect firms' competitive behavior in the labor market. A new feature of the theory is that it embeds an oligopsony competition structure in the labor market into a workhorse trade model with heterogeneous firms (Melitz, 2003) and allows entry and exit of firms to affect competition within a local labor market. Second, guided by the theory, I propose two complementary approaches to measure labor market distortion at the firm level empirically: (1) a production function estimation approach; and (2) a regression approach that exploits a unique exogenous demand shifter in China's context, namely the US-China Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) shock. These two measures cross-validate each other, and I show that they capture patterns of oligopsony. Finally, using the resulting measures of labor market distortion, I establish a causal link between China's trade policy reform, specifically reductions in both output and input tariffs and the consequential changes in labor market distortion.====To preview the main theoretical results, the paper begins by deriving a reduced-form representation of labor market distortion from a firm's profit maximization problem. This reduced-form representation - the ratio between the equilibrium marginal revenue product of labor (====) and wage (====) - summarizes all distortion in the labor market incurred by the firm, regardless of their sources. It also allows a measurement approach without imposing any structure on the labor market. The paper next develops a theoretical model to explain the mechanism through which trade policy affects distortion. To do so, I first incorporate recent microfoundations from labor economics literature to forge an oligopsony structure in the labor market, using a nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) labor supply system as in Berger et al. (2022). This structure is then immersed in Melitz (2003)’s environment to allow for endogenous entry and exit of firms following sectoral trade shocks. In this environment, firms are assumed to be atomistic and compete monopolistically in the national product market. Yet, firms' locations are distributed over a continuum of local labor markets, within which firms are large employers. The modeling approach here is motivated by two empirical patterns observed in the data: (1) within a local labor market, there are significant entries and exits following trade liberalization, and (2) firms' local labor market share responds to trade policy.==== The model developed provides clear and intuitive predictions for the effects of trade policy on labor market distortion. In the model, more productive firms have larger local labor market shares and exercise more market power over their workers. Starting from an initial equilibrium, when a country unilaterally opens more to trade by lowering its output tariffs, the competitive pressure from imports reduces each firm's profit. As a result, those firms at the margin, i.e., firms with productivity levels near the operating threshold, re-optimize and decide to: (1) stay or (2) exit the market, whereas non-incumbent firms may decide to (3) enter. Since profit generally decreases due to the competitive trade shock, the least productive firms exit; labor market share is reallocated towards more productive firms; thus, the average distortion increases. On the other hand, when the country lowers its input tariffs, it reduces production cost for all firms that use foreign inputs, increases each firm's profit, and induces entries of less productive firms into the market. As these firms gain market share, the average labor market distortion decreases.====Empirically, I measure firm-level labor market distortion with two approaches. The baseline approach exploits the reduced-form representation to measure the distortion nonparametrically. Specifically, I estimate the firm-level ====(s) by identifying a ==== production function and combine those with wage information available in production data. The production function estimation step adopts a nonparametric method recently emerged in industrial organization literature, developed by Gandhi et al. (2020) (henceforth, GNR).==== Because this measurement approach imposes no structural assumption other than profit maximization (with respect to materials), the measure obtained here is referred to as the nonparametric measure.====The second approach to measurement exploits a unique exogenous demand shock to Chinese firms, namely the US-China Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) shock, to identify the labor supply elasticity facing each firm. This approach combines the insight from the pass-through and trade policy uncertainty literature, as in Amiti et al. (2019) and Handley and Limão (2017), Pierce and Schott (2016), respectively.==== The intuition for the identification is that the TPU shock acts as an exogenous labor demand shock. Therefore, by observing the relational responses of firms in terms of wage and employment, one can trace out the elasticity of the labor supply curve facing the firms. By allowing the pattern of the response to be dependent on firms' local labor market share, this approach permits a measure of share-dependent firm-level distortion computed from regression estimates. This measure ties to the structure of the theoretical model and is thus referred to as the parametric measure.====Two main findings emerge from the empirical estimates of the labor market distortion. First, the nonparametric measure obtained from production function estimation indicates that labor market distortion is pervasive in China's manufacturing sector. The average magnitude implies a 47% pass-through rate of an idiosyncratic productivity shock to wage.==== The parametric measure, which captures purely a firm's labor market power, on average accounts for almost 76% of the distortion obtained from nonparametric estimates. Notably, throughout my 10-year sample of Chinese firms, crucial moments of distortion distribution, such as the mean, median, and dispersion, decrease over time.====With the obtained measures in hand, I empirically assess the effects of trade policy on the labor market distortion of firms, using China's accession to WTO in 2001 as a major shift in the country's trade policy regime. The regression model compares changes in the measured distortion between firms located within the same location unit, yet are exposed differentially to trade shocks due to their industry affiliations, following the standard approach in the empirical trade literature, as in Pavcnik (2002), Amiti and Konings (2007), Topalova and Khandelwal (2011), and Brandt et al. (2017). I find strong empirical support for the theoretical predictions. Qualitatively, increased import competition due to lower output tariffs leads to increased labor market distortion. Even though the effect is consistent with the theory, the magnitude and the statistical significance of this effect are small. On the other hand, access to cheaper inputs due to lower input tariffs causes a significant decrease in labor market distortion. I estimate that China's lowering of input tariffs during the sample period from 1998 to 2007 reduced labor market distortion by ==== on average. These results provide evidence that trade reform reduces overall labor market distortion in China's manufacturing sector.==== Theoretically, this paper builds on the international trade and labor market imperfections literature. Most related to my modeling approach of the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) labor supply system is the study by Berger et al. (2022). In their paper, the CES labor supply system is micro-founded from the discrete choice model of individual workers, much like how the CES demand system is derived.==== This paper's contribution is to embed this CES labor supply system into a canonical trade model of Melitz (2003) and allow trade policy to affect the local labor market competition through entries and exits of firms. By modeling the product market as monopolistic competition with constant markup, I can abstract from the complication of strategic interactions in the product market and specify a simple equilibrium selection rule to close the model, following the modeling technique in Atkeson and Burstein (2008), Eaton et al. (2012), Edmond et al. (2015) and most recently Gaubert and Itskhoki (2021). A few previous studies also integrate labor market imperfections into trade models with heterogeneous firms. Most recently, MacKenzie (2019) develops and estimates a quantitative trade model with oligopoly in the product market and oligopsony in the labor market, using Indian plant-level data. However, due to the complexity of the strategic interactions in both markets, the number of active firms in the market is assumed exogenous, and trade affects the labor market power through changes in product market power, a mechanism distinct from my model.==== In another closely related study, Heiland and Kohler (2019) examines a theoretical model with oligopoly and oligopsony, and allows for endogenous exits due to trade. In their framework, firms are homogeneous, and oligopsony arises due to horizontal worker heterogeneity. Jha and Rodriguez-Lopez (2021) specify a trade model with monopolistic competition in the product market and monopsonistic competition in the labor market to re-examine the welfare implications of trade. Helpman et al. (2010) and Amiti and Davis (2011) also incorporate labor market imperfections into trade models. Nonetheless, a common feature of these studies is that because labor market distortion is captured by fixed parameters, there is little room for trade to endogenously affect the distortion caused by firms' strategic behavior.====Methodologically, my paper is related to the productivity, markup, and pass-through estimation literature. Productivity estimation has recently been used to measure and study market power in the product market, for example, as in De Loecker and Warzynski (2012), Flynn et al. (2019). In trade literature, the impact of trade policy on markup has attracted considerable attention, including De Loecker (2011), De Loecker et al. (2016), Brandt et al. (2017). A growing literature has also adopted the productivity framework to study the market power of firms in factor markets, including Morlacco (2020), Brooks et al. (2021), Dobbelaere and Wiersma (2019).==== A common estimation framework used in these studies is the method developed by a series of papers, including Olley and Pakes (1996), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), and Ackerberg et al. (2015) (henceforth, ACF). A drawback to the ACF approach is that identifying the production function requires a Leontief functional-form assumption.==== In this paper, I adopt the Gandhi et al. (2020)’s method (henceforth, GNR) to consistently estimate labor market distortion at the firm level. My estimation procedure does not impose functional-form assumptions.==== To complement the production function approach, I also adopt insight from the pass-through estimation literature, as in Amiti et al. (2019), to parametrically measure the distortion. In this literature, the pass-through of international shocks to firm-level domestic prices is allowed to depend on a firm's market share within an industry. The local labor market share plays a similar role in my analysis and permits a variable pass-through rate from a productivity shock to wage paid by a firm.====Finally, my analysis of the labor market distortion in this paper is related to a large literature on resource misallocation due to market imperfections, including Restuccia and Rogerson (2008), Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Edmond et al. (2015), and Liu (2019), among others. In the context of China, Tombe and Zhu (2019), Cheng and Morrow (2018) also model frictions in goods and factor markets and examine their effects on productivity. However, these studies incorporate labor market frictions generically, and the frictions arise from aggregate labor supply elasticity without the layer of strategic competition. Regarding trade, my empirical results suggest that labor market distortion is large and perhaps on par with product market distortion, yet only the latter has been incorporated into the welfare calculations of trade, as in Arkolakis et al. (2012), Arkolakis et al. (2018), and others.","Trade reform, oligopsony, and labor market distortion: Theory and evidence",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000739,Available online 13 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

This paper studies optimal taxation in a small open economy with heterogeneous agents and endogenous debt constraints arising from the government's limited commitment to fiscal policies. The optimal labor tax decreases over time and is nonzero in the limit, and the optimal capital and domestic borrowing taxes are positive in the limit, deviating from the standard Ramsey tax results. The government's redistributive motive directly affects optimal tax levels, whereas binding debt constraints influence optimal tax dynamics. In the numerical analysis, a stronger redistributive preference requires greater initial tax distortions and a higher external debt level in the long run.","How does a government with a desire for redistribution determine its tax policies while facing limited borrowing? Taxes are the main source of revenue that affects the government's ability to issue or repay debt. At the same time, distortionary taxes and transfers redistribute resources across agents, so the government's preferences for greater redistribution affect its willingness to raise revenue and influence its borrowing capacity. When borrowing is constrained, redistributing via taxes is limited. Empirical works on the recent European debt crisis have demonstrated how the government's redistributive motive and debt accumulation are closely related.==== First, the rapid accumulation of external debt in the periods leading up to a crisis led to many countries facing such high costs of borrowing that they could not roll over their debt. Second, highly indebted countries such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain also experienced high levels of income dispersion. According to the European Union's Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, the Gini coefficients and S80/S20 income quintile share ratio in these countries were both higher than the EU-27 country average. Countries proposed different policy strategies to tackle the problems of constrained borrowing while maintaining the desired level of redistribution.====Motivated by these observations, this paper questions how both the government's redistributive motive and its limited ability to borrow affect optimal tax policies. The paper explores insights on the trade-off between redistribution and efficiency and studies how limited borrowing in the form of endogenously binding debt constraints restricts the government's ability to smooth taxes over time. While tax policies allow the government to achieve a desired level of redistribution, the government has an additional incentive to change taxes to relax debt constraints. Through tax policies, the government's redistributive motive influences its borrowing capacity.====I address these issues in a model of a small open economy with heterogeneous agents and the government's limited commitment. The model combines the sovereign debt framework of limited commitment (Aguiar et al. (2009) and Aguiar and Amador, 2011, Aguiar and Amador, 2014, Aguiar and Amador, 2016) with the Ramsey taxation framework (Chari et al. (1994), Chari and Kehoe (1999), and Werning (2007)). Domestic agents are impatient relative to the international intertemporal price of resources. Taxes are linear, consisting of distortionary and lump-sum components. The economy is subject to endogenous debt constraints arising from the government's lack of commitment in all policies. The debt constraints are such that the value of staying in contracted policies is weakly higher than the value of reneging. I consider a planner that chooses efficient allocation to maximize the social welfare, but is subject to the distortionary costs of policies and debt constraints. I then study optimal policies that implement the efficient allocation.====I establish three theoretical results on optimal labor taxation under the case of separable isoelastic preferences. First, perfect labor tax smoothing occurs when debt constraints do not bind. When debt is not constrained, the government borrows as needed and sets optimal labor taxes to balance the trade-off between redistribution and efficiency, which depend on skill distribution, distributional preference, and elasticities that are constant over time.====Binding debt constraints, however, limit the government's ability to borrow and maintain constant labor tax distortions over time. I find that front-loading tax distortion is optimal when debt constraints are relevant. Specifically, in each period that the debt constraint binds, the optimal distortionary labor tax permanently decreases for all future periods, given that the government is inequality averse and preferences are highly concave in consumption. The key mechanism is back-loading efficiency: lower future labor distortions increase the current period's borrowing capacity. This mechanism is present because of the distortionary cost of policies. An inequality-averse government would like to levy distortionary labor taxes to redistribute resources toward low-income agents. Faced with the distortionary cost and debt constraints, the government front-loads tax distortions when debt constraints do not bind and reduces tax distortions when debt constraints bind.====The third result is that the optimal labor tax converges to a nonzero value when domestic agents are impatient and debt constraints are binding infinitely often in the long run. Moreover, the labor tax's level in the limit depends on heterogeneity and distributional preference. Back-loading efficiency implies that the optimal labor tax in the long run maximizes the economy's efficiency, which is affected by redistribution in this case. The effect of redistribution, captured by skill distribution and the government's distributional preference, gives a nontrivial value for the optimal labor tax in the limit. In a representative-agent framework such as in Aguiar and Amador (2016), redistribution does not affect the economy's maximum efficiency, so the optimal labor tax in the limit is zero.====Optimal capital controls in the form of taxes on the domestic sector's borrowing are positive when debt constraints bind. Impatient domestic agents borrow over time and do not internalize the effect of their individual borrowing decisions on the aggregate debt constraints. Therefore, it is optimal to levy positive taxes that discourage domestic borrowing when the debt constraint binds. Income inequality affects the distribution of domestic borrowing, whereas both income inequality and distributional preference affect the cost of binding debt constraints. Hence, the levels of the domestic borrowing taxes depend on heterogeneity and distributional preference. In the long run, the optimal tax on domestic borrowing only depends on the discount factor and the international interest rate.====In addition, the optimal capital tax is positive in the long run when the value of reneging increases in the current capital stock. Because the government can renege on its policies and expropriate capital holdings, the efficient outcome discourages capital accumulation.====I examine the effect of redistribution on optimal labor taxes and find that the main determinant of tax levels is the relative ratio between the government's distributional preference and equilibrium market distribution over individual utilities. If the distributional preference is the same as the equilibrium distribution, then the optimal labor tax is zero. The government sets nonzero labor taxes only when its distributional preference differs from the competitive equilibrium's outcomes that are driven by heterogeneity.====The numerical analysis illustrates optimal policies in a model of no capital and a utilitarian welfare function. The government levies a labor tax in the initial periods to redistribute resources toward poorer households. In the long run, however, the government sets a labor subsidy to encourage highly productive agents to work more to increase the economy's borrowing capacity. The optimal domestic borrowing tax is zero initially when debt constraints do not bind and becomes positive as debt constraints bind in the long run. External debt increases even after debt constraints are binding. Tax dynamics correspond to a reduction in the distortionary costs of policies whenever the debt constraint binds.====Optimal tax and debt policies respond to changes in income inequality. In a comparative statics exercise, I find that a more unequal economy corresponds to a higher labor tax for more redistribution in the beginning of time and a higher labor subsidy for more efficiency in the long run. Lump-sum transfers also increase with respect to income inequality. Higher income inequality also leads to higher taxes on domestic borrowing when debt constraints bind because the distribution of domestic borrowing is more unequal. In addition, a more unequal economy accumulates more external debt over time.==== This paper contributes to the optimal taxation and debt management research of the public finance literature (e.g., Barro (1979), Lucas and Stokey (1983), Chari et al. (1994), Aiyagari and McGrattan (1998), Chari and Kehoe (1999), Aiyagari et al. (2002), and many other papers). The argument for labor tax smoothing often relies on the fact that the government can issue debt that is contingent to all states and is not constrained beyond the natural debt limit. In this paper, tax smoothing is not always optimal; the government's ability to smooth tax distortion is restricted by the international lenders' willingness to lend. The nonzero capital and domestic borrowing taxes are in contrast to the zero convergence of the capital tax from Judd (1985), Chamley (1986), Chari et al. (1994), and Straub and Werning (2020) because the endogenous debt limits depend on the capital stock, and the domestic agents do not internalize the effect of their borrowing on aggregate debt constraints.====The optimal taxation results are relevant to the current research in optimal fiscal policies with heterogeneity and the government's redistributive motive. Bhandari et al. (2017) and Werning (2007) both find that the government's redistributive motive has a significant impact on optimal policies. Werning (2007) develops the conditions for perfect tax smoothing with redistribution, while Bhandari et al. (2017) emphasize the impact of the initial distribution of heterogeneity on the optimal allocation and optimal debt in the long run. In this paper, I highlight the role of endogenous debt constraints in changing optimal tax dynamics, which results in imperfect tax smoothing. I also argue that the distribution of heterogeneity and the government's redistributive motive are important in determining the optimal debt level that is sustainable in the long run. The paper also relates to the work of Chien and Wen (2022), which studies optimal taxation with idiosyncratic risk and market incompleteness. In Chien and Wen (2022), tax smoothing is limited when upper debt limit is relevant, and debt accumulation is optimal for the government to provide liquidity for precautionary saving households. In this paper, the upper debt limit is endogenously determined by the government's ability to sustain debt, whereas debt accumulation is exogenously driven by domestic households' impatience.====I introduce heterogeneity and the redistributive effect of fiscal policies in the literature that studies the government's lack of commitment in both tax and debt policies. The volatile tax and government expenditures are similar to Cuadra et al. (2010) and Bauducco and Caprioli (2014). The theoretical finding of front-loading labor taxation when borrowing is tightened relates to the absence of tax smoothing in Pouzo and Presno (2022) and the quantitative result of Arellano and Bai (2016), in which higher tax distortion would make the country more likely to default. The result on front-loading tax distortion also relates to Karantounias (2018)’ s “fear” mechanism that comes from the default risk that makes debt issuance expensive. In this paper, the threat of default is present when debt constraints are binding, which leads to lower tax distortions in future periods.====This paper contributes to research on the interaction between inequality and sovereign default risk (Ferriere (2015), Balke and Ravn (2016), D'Erasmo and Mendoza, 2016, D'Erasmo and Mendoza, 2020, Dovis et al. (2016), Jeon and Kabukcuoglu (2018), Deng (2021), Bianchi et al. (2023), and others). I provide new theoretical findings on optimal taxation in a general framework of inequality and the government's lack of commitment. The paper establishes that front-loading labor tax distortions is optimal when redistribution is costly and borrowing is limited. The optimal capital control in the form of a tax on domestic borrowing is optimal when borrowing is constrained. Moreover, the government's distributional preference affects optimal tax levels only if it differs from the equilibrium market's distribution.====The dynamic environment in this paper is an extension of the one in Aguiar and Amador (2016), adding heterogeneity and distributional preference and allowing for richer tax systems. Aguiar and Amador (2016) find that the labor tax must go to zero in the long run as a result of front-loading efficient consumption and leisure allocation. In this paper, the tax limit can be any real value. More interestingly, when the effect of redistribution is turned off in the model, the labor tax is zero in the limit, consistent with their findings. The paper shows that the government's redistributive consideration, not heterogeneity, is the main source for the changes in tax levels.====The model qualitatively accounts for the positive correlation between income dispersion and the debt level that several empirical papers have documented. Berg and Sachs (1988) show that income dispersion is a key predictor of a country's probability of rescheduling debt and the bond spread in secondary markets. Aizenman and Jinjarak (2012) describe a negative correlation between income dispersion and the tax base and a positive correlation with sovereign debt. Recently, Ferriere (2015), Jeon and Kabukcuoglu (2018), and Deng (2021) also provide empirical evidence that rising income dispersion significantly increases sovereign default risk.==== The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the environment, the competitive equilibrium, and the government's lack-of-commitment problem. Section 2 characterizes the equilibrium. Section 3 formulates the efficiency problem, and section 4 derives the main results of the optimal taxation under separable isoelastic preferences. Section 5 analyzes the effect of redistribution on optimal taxes. Section 6 provides a numerical analysis of optimal policies and efficient allocation and demonstrates a comparative statics exercise with respect to changes in skill dispersion.

We study the mechanism through which changes in capital flows and capital account policies can influence income distributions in a ==== model. Our model features heterogeneous agents and financial frictions, with banks intermediating between household savings and entrepreneur investment. Inflow surges disproportionately raise entrepreneur income, exacerbating ","Surges in capital inflows driven by changes in global economic conditions can have adverse impacts (e.g. Ghosh et al., 2014, Ghosh et al., 2016). In the short run, capital inflows can benefit the destination economy by reducing the cost of financing domestic consumption and investment. Over time, however, capital flow reversals can cause painful sudden stops (Calvo, 1998), elevating the risks of domestic banking crises (Mendoza, 2010; Caballero, 2016). Policymakers have acknowledged the potential adverse effects of excessive capital flows. For example, while the IMF advocated capital account openness, it has become more amenable in recent years to the use of capital account restrictions as a “… part of the policy toolkit to manage inflows” (Ostry et al., 2010).====Capital flows may also influence the distribution of income. For example, de Haan and Sturm (2017) argue that the benefits of inflow surges disproportionately accrue to agents who are more adept at capitalizing on them, exacerbating the skewness of the distribution of income. In contrast, when capital flow reversals occur, the burdens are likely to fall disproportionately on the poor. Similarly, Furceri and Loungani (2018) and Furceri et al. (2019) document evidence that episodes of capital account liberalization are associated with increased inequality.====In this paper, we examine the relations between capital flow surges and income distributions, both empirically and theoretically.====We first document empirical evidence that capital flows have significant impacts on income inequality. We use an unbalanced panel of 128 countries, including both advanced economies (AE) and emerging market economies (EME), during the period from 2001 to 2020 to estimate the impact of changes in both gross capital flows (inflows and outflows) and net capital inflows on income inequality, measured by year-over-year changes in the Gini coefficient.====To address potential endogeneity issues, we instrument our capital flow measures using changes in two-year U.S. Treasury yields interacted with a measure of financial remoteness constructed by Rose and Spiegel (2009), based on the great-circle distance from New York City, the financial center of the United States. Under the assumption that the non-U.S. economies in our sample are small relative to the global financial market, an easing of U.S. financial conditions should encourage capital flows to other economies. To identify the relative impact of this shock across foreign countries, we follow the literature in assuming that gravity effects imply that proximity to the United States amplifies a nation's sensitivity to changes in U.S. financial conditions. Our evidence suggests that this instrumental variable is valid and the null hypothesis of weak instruments is strongly rejected.====We estimate that, on average, a one standard deviation increase in capital inflows is associated with a 0.75 percentage point increase in the year-over-year changes in a country's Gini coefficient, while a one standard deviation increase in outflows is associated with a 0.79 percentage point decrease. We also find that a one standard deviation increase in ==== inflows is associated with a 0.39 percentage point increase in the growth rate of a country's Gini coefficient. These numbers are statistically and economically significant, and are robust to a wide variety of perturbations in specification, sample, and estimation method.====To understand the mechanisms that drive the empirical link between capital flows and income distributions, we next construct a small open economy model with heterogeneous agents and financial frictions.====The model features two types of infinitely-lived agents: households and entrepreneurs, with a large number of each type. Competitive firms use capital, skilled labor and unskilled labor to produce a homogeneous consumption good. The production technology features capital-skill complementarity in the spirit of Krusell et al. (2000). Entrepreneurs supply skilled labor to firms. They have access to an investment technology that transforms consumption goods to productive capital. They finance spending from labor income, capital returns, and borrowings from domestic banks and foreign investors. Foreign borrowing rates include a risk premium that depends on the size of the external debt (Neumeyer and Perri, 2005; Uribe and Yue, 2006). Households supply unskilled labor to firms. They do not have access to the investment technology. They can save in domestic banks or buy foreign assets. Competitive and risk-neutral domestic banks take deposits from the households and extend loans to the entrepreneurs. Financial intermediation costs generate a spread between deposit and lending interest rates, as in Cúrdia and Woodford (2016). The government imposes taxes on both capital inflows and outflows, and rebates the tax revenues to domestic households and entrepreneurs.====In this model environment, changes in capital flows impact on income distributions through changes in capital returns and capital-skill complementarity. We use our model to study the implications of capital flow shocks and capital account policies for the distribution of income between households and entrepreneurs.====The model predicts that a shock that leads to a surge in capital inflows benefits entrepreneurs more than households, and therefore increases income inequality, whereas a shock that leads to an increase in capital outflows would reduce income inequality. Capital flow shocks in our model impact not only on capital income distributions through their effect on relative returns on entrepreneurs' capital investment vs. households' savings, but also on labor income distributions through capital-skill complementarity.====In our model, a shock that induces capital outflows (e.g., a reduction in the capital outflow tax rate) would raise the households' capital income by boosting the domestic deposit rate. Facing higher funding costs, banks increase the lending rate, depressing investment and output. The contraction in output reduces the marginal product of capital, lowering the entrepreneurs' capital income. Although the decline in investment reduces future capital stocks, mitigating the decline in capital rents, the decline in output under our calibration dominates, leading to persistent declines in capital rents. The fall in capital stocks also reduces the skill wage premium through capital-skill complementarity, lowering the entrepreneurs' share in labor income as well. Thus, the shock that induces capital outflows also reduces income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient.====In contrast, a shock that induces capital inflows (e.g., a reduction in the inflow tax rate) increases income inequality. With increased capital inflows, entrepreneurs rely less on domestic banks for financing investment spending, leading to a decline in the domestic lending rate and reducing the financing costs of investment. This in turn boosts investment and production, raising the levels of labor income for both households and entrepreneurs. Increased investment leads to increases in future capital stocks, raising the skill wage premium through capital-skill complementarity. Thus, the entrepreneurs' share in labor income rises. Meanwhile, the entrepreneurs' share in capital income also rises because the expansion in production raises capital rental income. Overall, the shock that induces a surge in capital inflows also skews the income distribution in favor of entrepreneurs, raising income inequality measured by the Gini. A shock that induces ==== capital inflows (e.g., a decline in the foreign interest rate) raises income inequality through the same channels.====To evaluate the quantitative importance of the model's mechanism, we simulate the model and run the same regressions using simulated data as we do using actual data. We obtain estimates of the relation between changes in the Gini and capital flows that are very similar—both qualitatively and quantitatively—to those using actual data. This finding suggests that the model's mechanism is empirically plausible and quantitatively important.====Our paper contributes to the literature on the implications of capital account policies. Capital account restrictions have been shown to distort financial markets (Edwards, 1999; Jeanne et al., 2012), international trade (Wei and Zhang, 2007; Costinot et al., 2014), and the ability of the central bank to stabilize the macroeconomy (Chang et al., 2015; Liu and Spiegel, 2015).==== Our work is also related to the literature on capital account liberalization in the presence of financial frictions (Aoki et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2021).====Our primary focus is the distributional implications of capital account policies. In an earlier study, Bumann and Lensink (2016) examine restrictions on ==== capital flows. They show that liberalization can raise capital inflows, with the distributional impacts dependent on the level of financial sector development. In contrast, our analysis considers the implications of liberalization of ==== capital flows, with changes in capital inflows and outflows having quite different implications for income distributions.",Capital flows and income inequality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000624,Available online 31 May 2023,2023,Research Article,2.0

However, structural parameter estimation using the seminal Feenstra econometric methodology focuses on estimates of only ==== and a bilateral export-supply elasticity (labeled ====). Separately, modern trade agreements are increasingly “deep,” meaning they reduce fixed trade costs alongside variable trade costs. First, in the spirit of Arkolakis (2010), we extend the Melitz model of trade to allow for increasing marginal market-penetration costs in an empirically tractable manner to help understand the relative impacts on trade, extensive margins, intensive margins, and welfare of reducing fixed trade costs and variable trade costs. Second, we provide a microeconomic foundation for estimating all three parameters using the Feenstra methodology alongside a gravity equation. Third, we demonstrate the importance of increasing marginal costs for shallow and deep trade-agreement liberalizations using two counterfactual exercises.","Central to the post-2000 modern quantitative models of international trade are two parameters. The first – and arguably most visible – is the elasticity of substitution in consumption among differentiated products, ====. This parameter is key in the seminal theoretical foundation for the gravity equation with Armington preferences in Anderson (1979), monopolistic competition model of intra-industry trade with Dixit-Stiglitz preferences in Krugman (1980), analysis of optimal tariffs in Broda et al. (2008) and Ossa (2016), and a vast array of applied computable general equilibrium (CGE) models used for trade-policy analyses, cf., U.S. International Trade Commission (2019). The second parameter, which surfaced over the last 20 years, is a (inverse) measure of heterogeneity of firms' productivities, which we denote ====. Motivated by theoretical models of Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Melitz (2003), ==== is the key parameter in modern quantitative trade models with heterogeneous firms for capturing the infamous “trade elasticity” (i.e., elasticity of bilateral trade with respect to ==== bilateral variable trade costs), one of two sufficient statistics to measure welfare effects of trade liberalizations in a broad set of quantitative trade models (cf., Arkolakis et al. (2012), henceforth, ACR).====A common assumption to these quantitative trade models is constant marginal costs. By contrast, the most widely respected structural method for estimating ==== – introduced by Feenstra (1994) and further developed by Broda and Weinstein (2006) (henceforth, F/BW) and Broda et al. (2008) – assumes bilateral export supply prices are positive functions of the level of exports to foreign markets, which suggests increasing marginal costs of exporting to each destination market. We will refer to the parameter that governs the bilateral export supply elasticity as ====. Although ==== and ==== currently play central roles in trade theory and calibration exercises of new quantitative trade models, ==== has been largely ignored. Moreover, the bilateral export supply elasticity has typically been incorporated in these econometric analyses in an ad hoc manner. For instance, in Feenstra (1994), Broda and Weinstein (2006), and Soderbery, 2015, Soderbery, 2018, positively-sloped bilateral export supply curves were simply assumed. More recently, Feenstra et al. (2018) extend the method of Feenstra (1994) allowing firm heterogeneity based upon a standard Melitz model with constant marginal costs, but still introduce an equation that “plays the role of a supply curve” (p. 140).====Separately, modern international trade agreements – such as free trade agreements (FTAs) – are increasingly “deep,” meaning that, beyond the typical reductions in ==== tariff rates found in “shallow” agreements, they also reduce ==== trade costs. The World Bank has recently compiled a large data set on deep trade agreements' (DTAs) provisions. The database, summarized comprehensively in Hofmann et al. (2017), documents the extensive growth in DTAs over the past twenty years. A notable economic difference concerning these deep provisions is that they relate to regulatory convergences and administrative liberalizations that are unrelated to the quantity of goods exported and are more readily interpreted as reducing fixed trade costs. For instance, the most popular non-tariff measures included in modern trade agreements are customs administration (often referred to as trade facilitation measures), competition policy, sanitary and photosanitary (SPS) regulations, and technical barriers to trade (TBT) regulations.====Recent empirical work using gravity equations indicates economically and statistically significant effects of indexes of DTAs' provisions on trade flows, cf., Kohl et al. (2016), Baier and Regmi (2022), Breinlich et al. (2022) and Fontagne et al. (2022). By contrast, there has been a dearth in numerical analyses of variable versus fixed bilateral trade costs in either standard CGE models (such as GTAP) or in the new quantitative trade models. Zhai (2008) is one of the earliest – and rare – studies to introduce a standard Melitz model (with constant marginal costs) into a global CGE model of world trade and to contrast the trade and welfare effects of a 5% variable trade-cost reduction relative to a 50% fixed trade-cost reduction.==== In Zhai (2008), it would take a ==== reduction in bilateral fixed trade costs to achieve the equivalent gain in welfare as a 4% reduction in ==== variable trade costs (a ratio of 7.25:1). More recently, however, Arkolakis et al. (2021) extend the canonical Melitz model of trade to allow multiproduct firms facing constant marginal costs in core-product production, but allowing increasing marginal market-penetration costs and increasing marginal costs in non-core products. Among several findings, one counterfactual implies that it would take a 13% reduction in fixed trade costs with countries to generate the same welfare gain as a 4 percentage point reduction in tariff rates (or a ratio of 3.25:1). Such estimates suggest evaluating the role of increasing versus constant marginal costs to address the question: Why have countries increasingly pursued deep trade agreements?====Given these considerations, we now summarize our paper's contributions. Our first contribution, motivated by Arkolakis (2010), is to introduce increasing marginal costs (IMC) into the Melitz model via an empirically-tractable formulation of increasing marginal market-penetration costs. To get a sense of the impact of IMC on the trade elasticity, consider a simple Armington trade model. Fig. 1 illustrates the attenuation of the intensive margin elasticity in the presence of a positively-sloped bilateral export supply curve, consistent with IMC. In the standard case of constant marginal costs (CMC), a 1 % increase in ==== variable trade costs, ====, lowers bilateral imports from country ==== to country ==== (====) by ====, where ==== is the elasticity of substitution in consumption. However, with IMC, the same 1 % increase in ==== variable trade costs lowers bilateral imports by less, ====. Fig. 1 clearly illustrates that under CMC the trade elasticity is a function solely of the elasticity of substitution, whereas under IMC the trade elasticity also depends on an index of the shape of the supply curve.====Our extended model yields several analytical results. First, we derive a gravity equation similar to that in ACR except that the extensive margin elasticity and the trade elasticity with respect to (====) variable trade costs are magnified; yet, the variable trade-cost intensive margin elasticity is diminished, consistent with Fig. 1. An implication is that variable trade-cost liberalizations with IMC will have more firm entry and exit and more labor reallocations than under CMC. Second, the fixed trade-cost trade elasticity – which is a function of the variable trade-cost extensive margin elasticity relative to the variable trade-cost intensive margin elasticity – is magnified under IMC. Moreover, a further implication of IMC is that the fixed trade-cost trade elasticity is magnified relative to the variable trade-cost trade elasticity, which will be important in understanding the welfare-equivalent impacts of fixed trade-cost liberalizations relative to variable trade-cost liberalizations in deep FTAs. Third, allowing IMC diminishes the welfare effect of a given change in the domestic trade share (for a given ====). The intuition is that real wage gains from a trade liberalization can be traced to changes in average productivity. In the Melitz model, changes in average productivity are proportionate to changes in output of the zero-cutoff-profit (ZCP) productivity firm. In the CMC case, the latter are directly proportionate to productivity changes of the ZCP firm. However, with increasing marginal costs (====), output of the ZCP firm rises less than proportionately to the change in the ZCP firm's productivity. The gains to average productivity are diminished at a rate of ====.====Our second contribution is to develop further the microeconomic foundation for the F/BW econometric approach to estimate ==== and ==== by accounting explicitly for firm heterogeneity. Unlike F/BW, our approach distinctly recognizes the importance of differences in the masses of exporting firms, which depend on the exporting country's labor-force size and the zero-cutoff-profit productivity threshold. In the context of the heterogeneous-firm models, one must account for both new import varieties from trade liberalizations as well as declining numbers of domestic varieties. The F/BW reduced-form estimating equation includes, two variables and one interaction term. Our extension of the F/BW approach to account for firm heterogeneity motivates the inclusion of 6 additional variables, for a total of 8 variables (including the dependent variable) and 28 interaction terms. While we can show all 35 (right-hand-side) coefficients are functions of the three structural parameters only, the large number of nonlinear constraints precludes estimation of ==== and ==== simultaneously. Instead, we pursue a two-pronged approach, composed of two reduced-form estimating equations. In the first part of our estimation, we implement our extension of the F/BW reduced-form equation that allows us to estimate ==== and ==== while controlling explicitly for firm heterogeneity. In the second part, we use the gravity equation generated from our theoretical model to identify ==== using the trade elasticity alongside the first part's estimate of ====. Our novel estimation approach yields median estimates across the distribution of industries of ==== and ==== of 6.45 and 6.00, respectively – approximately ====, respectively, than the comparable F/BW estimates ignoring firm heterogeneity. Moreover, our median estimate of ==== from the second step is 8.50 – which is very close to Eaton and Kortum (2002)’s and Arkolakis (2010)’s preferred estimate of 8.28.====Our third contribution is to illustrate the impact of recognizing increasing marginal costs on the estimated effects of DTAs in the world. Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016) emphasized that economists have not paid sufficient attention to the study of the effects of trade-policy changes other than ==== tariff-rate changes, and that a better understanding of the effects of reduced fixed trade costs on international trade and economic welfare is critical. In this spirit, we conduct two numerical analyses. In the first exercise, we show that – even under IMC – the welfare gains from trade for an economy can be captured by a function of an economy's current intra-national trade share and the trade elasticity. This result is fully consistent with the main conclusion in ACR that the trade elasticity (independent of its structural interpretation) and the intra-national trade share are sufficient statistics to measure the welfare effect of a change in bilateral variable or fixed trade costs (==== or ====, respectively). However, in the presence of IMC, the trade elasticity is higher (in absolute terms) and consequently the welfare gains lower, owing to a “welfare diminution effect” attributable to diminishing marginal returns. In a second exercise, we examine the ==== impacts of variable trade-cost changes and fixed trade-cost changes. We show that, for typical values of ==== and ====, under CMC (====) the degree of liberalization of fixed trade costs needed to generate an equivalent increase in welfare is very large relative to the degree of liberalization of variable trade costs, questioning the increasing effort toward deep trade agreements. By contrast, under increasing marginal costs (====), the degree of liberalization of fixed trade costs needed to generate an equivalent increase in welfare is ==== relative to the degree of liberalization of variable trade costs, which helps explain the attractiveness of deep trade agreements. For instance, we show for the United States that, under CMC, fixed trade costs would have to be reduced by 57% to provide the same increase in welfare as a reduction in variable trade costs of 3%. By contrast, under the empirically supported assumption of IMC, it would take only a 14% reduction in fixed trade costs to increase U.S. welfare by the same 3% variable trade-cost reduction.====The remainder of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we introduce and solve our Melitz model allowing increasing marginal costs, asymmetric countries, and a Pareto distribution of productivities. In section 3, we solve for our gravity equation and trade elasticity, derive the variable- and fixed-trade-cost elasticities of extensive and (for variable trade costs) intensive margins, discuss welfare implications, and provide the intuition behind our “welfare diminution effect.” In section 4, we discuss our econometric methodology, empirical specifications, and data sources. In section 5, we provide estimates of ====, ====, ====, and the variable- and fixed-trade-cost trade elasticities. In section 6, we provide numerical estimates of a counterfactual analysis of the impact of introducing increasing marginal costs on the welfare effects from trade and another counterfactual analysis demonstrating the importance of recognizing empirically-justified increasing marginal costs toward evaluating the quantitative welfare significance of liberalizations of fixed trade costs relative to those of variable trade costs, two components of (modern) deep trade agreements. In section 7, we offer some conclusions.","Increasing marginal costs, firm heterogeneity, and the gains from “deep” international trade agreements",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000600,Available online 30 May 2023,2023,Research Article,3.0

Dirty production is shifted towards countries with laxer climate policies, known as carbon leakage. A ==== mitigates but does not prevent carbon leakage. Its impact on emissions is limited, and it mainly “protects” dirty domestic production sectors with tradeable goods (in relative terms). Benefits from lower emissions damage materialize only in the medium to long run. From the perspective of a region that introduces carbon pricing, the downturn is smaller and long-run benefits are larger if more regions participate. However, for non-participating regions, there is no incremental incentive to participate as they forego trade ==== and face higher production costs along the transition. Because of the costly transition, average world welfare may fall as a result of global carbon pricing unless “the rich” assist “the poor”.","Many economies around the world have committed to ambitious climate goals and discuss climate change mitigation policies, including approaches to pricing carbon, and avoid carbon leakage. To evaluate different possible policies, the assessment of their macroeconomic consequences is of utmost importance. This is not only true from an academic perspective, but also for G7/G20 policymakers. Not least following up on the Glasgow Climate Pact, the issue is one of their top priorities on the 2022/2023 agenda.====In this paper, we contribute to the discussion by analyzing the macroeconomic and welfare implications of different policy choices regarding carbon pricing, border adjustments and climate clubs, also with respect to sectoral and reginal redistribution. We do this within a three-region version of the environmental multi-sector dynamic general equilibrium model ==== (see Hinterlang et al., 2022). The model features multiple interrelated production sectors that vary in their emissions intensity, factor intensity, use of intermediate inputs, and contribution to final demand along the lines of Bouakez et al. (2023). In addition to their model, agents in our model also engage in international trade. Following Heutel (2012), Annicchiarico and Di Dio (2015) and Annicchiarico et al. (2018), among others, emissions occur as a by-product of production and differ by sector. Firms in each sector can engage in costly abatement activities. Unabated emissions increase the stock of carbon in the atmosphere, which can ultimately result in a loss of production (see also Annicchiarico et al., 2022, for a discussion). In our baseline simulations, we derive five important insights with respect to the economic consequences. They can be summarized as follows.====First, our results confirm previous findings regarding the adverse impact of introducing a carbon price because production becomes more expensive. However, emissions reduction eventually decreases emissions-induced (production) damage and generates positive economic effects. It takes time before these positive effects can overcompensate the adverse effects of the cost push on output and consumption.====Second, the more regions participate in carbon pricing, the shorter is the downturn, at least for those regions that introduce a carbon price anyway. The reason is that emissions reduction is larger when more regions participate, and this reduces damage faster.====However, our third finding is that, if one or more regions introduce carbon pricing, there is not really an incremental incentive for the non-participating regions to participate. This is mainly due to the fact that they, then, forego trade spillovers and face a cost push implied by introducing a carbon price. Trade spillovers in non-participating regions emerge because agents substitute expensive goods that are produced in regions with a carbon price by cheaper but dirtier goods produced in non-participating regions. This is called carbon leakage.====Fourth, border adjustment dampens carbon leakage, and especially dirty foreign sectors may indeed be affected negatively (in relative terms). Conversely, dirty domestic production sectors with tradeable goods can benefit as (especially domestic) demand is tilted towards them. However, border adjustment alone does not seem to provide sufficient incentives for non-participating regions to introduce carbon pricing. The resulting additional emissions reduction, compared to not having border adjustment, is also limited. Environmental benefits of a border adjustment mechanism increase if the dirty domestic production sectors are relatively clean producers relative to their foreign counterparts.====Last, but not least, the time it takes until positive effects from carbon pricing materialize may take a generation's lifetime or more. Hence, public measures compensating the negative effects may be worth considering. We do not explicitly model this in our paper, but these could include public investments in or aid for infrastructures and innovative technologies that foster the transition to an emissions-reduced world (and, hence, speed up the positive gains from that). Given the time it takes before positive effects of emissions reduction materialize, deficit-financing such measures could foster the well-being of those generations that bear downturn-implied costs now, and shift the burden to those that benefit. However, additional research to analyze under which conditions this may be a desirable choice is certainly necessary.====Concerning welfare, our simulations show that introducing a world-wide carbon price is good for the “rich” countries that price carbon already or are planning to do so in any case. However, it is harmful for regions with low per-capita income from the start, the “poor” regions. This is because the downturn resulting from pricing carbon generates much higher welfare losses in low-income regions with already low per-capita consumption levels. In our model simulations, this effect is so severe that the average world-household does not want to introduce a common carbon price.====As the rich benefit if more regions participate in carbon pricing, they may have an interest in providing incentives for the poor to do so, too. In additional model simulations, we combine regionally differentiated carbon prices and per-capita transfers to the poor, which is also discussed in IMF (2022). The transfers are financed by proceeds of carbon pricing in the rich countries. The simulation results show that such an approach may lead to relative welfare gains for everyone, even though the rich countries then face lower welfare gains and a stronger downturn relative to our baseline simulations without price differentiation and transfers. Another promising way to reduce the costs of unilaterally introduced carbon pricing for some regions may be allowing for offsets, i.e. allow the carbon-price introducing region(s) to abate in other regions where the marginal abatement cost is lower. This channels abatement investments towards regions in which they are less costly and/or more beneficial, which may also be considered as a transfer between regions that augments abatement and productivity gains world-wide. In any case, our simulations show that, without further incentives for the poor regions, it may be rather difficult to implement global carbon pricing.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss related literature in Section 2. The model is introduced in Section 3, its calibration in Section 4. General simulation results are described in Section 5. Section 6 focuses on simulating a mechanism that redistributes welfare gains between regions and discusses caveats of the analysis at hand, and Section 7 concludes.","Carbon pricing, border adjustment and climate clubs: Options for international cooperation",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000582,29 May 2023,2023,Research Article,4.0

Most nonlinear machine learning models outperform logistic regression in out-of-sample predictions and forecasting. We identify economic drivers of our machine learning models by applying a novel framework based on Shapley values, uncovering nonlinear relationships between the predictors and crisis risk. Throughout, the most important predictors are credit growth and the slope of the yield curve, both domestically and globally. A flat or inverted yield curve is of most concern when nominal interest rates are low and credit growth is high.","Financial crises have huge economic and social costs (Hoggarth et al., 2002; Ollivaud and Turner, 2015; Laeven and Valencia, 2018; Aikman et al., 2018). Spotting their warning signs sufficiently early is therefore of great importance for policy makers. Doing so can facilitate the timely activation of countercyclical macroprudential policies, and reduce the likelihood and severity of financial crises in the face of rising risks (Giese et al., 2013; Cerutti et al., 2017; Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey, 2018). But identifying a reliable set of early warning predictors is challenging for several reasons. First, there is a relatively small set of observed crises, which makes robust modelling difficult. Second, crisis indicators often flash red only when it is already too late to intervene. Third, it can be challenging to distil complicated early warning models into simple and transparent indicators that can help guide timely intervention by macroprudential authorities. Finally, economic and financial systems are subject to inherent unpredictability and ‘Knightian’ uncertainty which means that some events are almost certainly unknowable in advance (Aikman et al., 2014), as the economic fallout from Covid-19 exemplified, although identifying underlying vulnerabilities might still be useful for such cases.====This paper applies machine learning models to financial crisis prediction. Such models have two main advantages over more traditional regression-based models that are typically used in the crisis prediction literature. First, machine learning models generally outperform traditional models in prediction problems. Second, machine learning models can flexibly and easily learn rich signals from the data such as nonlinearities and interactions. These may be particularly important in this context given that financial crises are rare and extreme events likely to exhibit unknown nonlinear dependencies prior to their crystallisation (Alessi and Detken, 2018). While previous studies have identified the importance of focussing on the tails of the distribution of explanatory variables such as credit growth, or considering interactions among variables (e.g. Borio and Drehmann, 2009; Jordà et al., 2015b; Krishnamurthy and Muir, 2020; Aldasoro et al., 2018; Greenwood et al., 2022), they typically employed conventional regression approaches which require specifying these nonlinearities and interactions a priori. And due to limited degrees of freedom and the risks of overfitting (i.e. the discovery of supposed patterns that do not generalise to new data), such approaches typically only explore interactions across two or three variables and nonlinearities in a single variable. By contrast, machine learning approaches can flexibly explore a much wider set of possible nonlinearities and interactions without the need for pre-specification.====One drawback of many machine learning approaches is, however, that their black box predictions can be difficult to interpret and explain. To tackle this, we decompose our machine learning predictions into the contributions of individual variables using the Shapley value and regression framework (Strumbelj and Kononenko, 2010; Joseph, 2020, Buckmann and Andreas, 2023 (forthcoming)). This approach allows us both to identify the key economic drivers of our models and to test those statistically. As such, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to provide a detailed analysis of ==== machine learning models predict financial crises. Our approach also helps to tackle a key challenge faced by policy makers in using machine learning models to inform their decisions. In particular, it facilitates enhanced accountability and transparency by unpacking the economic reasoning behind model predictions which might be used to inform policy decisions (in combination with other models, data, market intelligence, and judgement). This is crucial given the need for public policy makers to explain the rationale for their decisions rather than simply pointing to black box models.====Our best performing machine learning models are clearly capable of predicting most financial crises well in advance. They also correctly predict the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008, giving differentiated signals between countries that reflect different economic realities and outcomes. Credit growth and the slope of the yield curve, both domestically and globally, are particularly robust indicators. Our models also identify some important nonlinearities and interactions. For example, strong domestic credit growth against a backdrop of a globally flat or inverted yield curve considerably heightens crisis risk.====While such predictors should not necessarily be seen as triggers for a financial crisis, they can indicate that a country is significantly more vulnerable to a crisis in the face of shocks. So they can be used as important signals of growing vulnerabilities which can guide the deployment of macroprudential policies aimed at reducing the likelihood of a crisis or dampening its negative consequences.====In our baseline setup, we aim to predict financial crises one to two years in advance. We use the Macrohistory Database by Jordà et al. (2017), which covers macroeconomic and financial variables from 17 advanced economies over more than 140 years and contains a binary financial crisis variable. We compare the performance of a logistic regression with a range of machine learning models: decision trees, random forests, extremely randomised trees, support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks. We find that, with the exception of individual decision trees, all machine learning models have strong predictive power and outperform the logistic regression.====Investigating the drivers of our models, we find that credit growth and the slope of the yield curve, both domestically and globally, are the most important predictors of financial crises across a diverse set of models. By contrast, stock prices, house prices, money and the current account have lower overall predictive power. We also find that the global and domestic slope of the yield curve and credit growth retain their primary importance as predictive variables both when we consider longer prediction horizons and if we exclude clustered crises or use the alternative crisis classification by Baron et al. (2021). But when examining the importance of variables over time, we find that global credit growth only appears to be a relevant predictor after World War 2, with much of its importance attributable to the Global Financial Crisis.====While the importance of domestic credit growth is well known in the literature (Borio and Lowe, 2002; Drehmann et al., 2011; Schularick and Taylor, 2012; Aikman et al., 2013; Jordà et al., 2013, Jordà et al., 2015b; Giese et al., 2014), the role of the yield curve has been far less explored and usually only studied in the context of predicting recessions rather than financial crises. We find that the flatter or more inverted the domestic yield curve is, the higher the chance of a crisis, even for those crises that are not preceded by a recession. This could be linked to a lower differential between the interest rate a bank earns on its (relatively long-term) loans relative to what it pays for deposits in such yield curve environments, which can depress bank profitability. But since this result is stronger when nominal yields are low, it may also reflect the search for yield and increased risk-taking that can often be observed prior to financial crises. The global yield curve slope is also highly important—indeed it has more predictive value than the domestic slope when controlling for other factors. We also find that it is truly the global slope which matters most rather than the slope in, for example, a dominant country in the global financial system. However, we also find a strong interplay between the global slope and recessions, suggesting that its power in predicting financial crises partially stems from its role as a good leading indicator for a global economic slowdown.====The strong predictive power of our best performing machine learning models may partially be attributed to the simple and intuitive nonlinear relationships and interactions that we uncover. These help to identify zones of particular vulnerability to future financial crises, in a similar spirit to recent work by Richter et al. (2021) and Greenwood et al. (2022), although we find a much stronger role for the yield curve, which they do not consider, than asset prices, which we find to be less important than they do. We also find that crisis probability increases materially at high levels of global credit growth but this variable has nearly no effect at low or medium levels. Similarly, interactions seem to be important—particularly between global and domestic variables. For example, many crises fall into an environment of strong domestic credit growth and a globally flat or inverted yield curve.====Our paper contributes to the literature in four main ways. First, we believe that our study is the first to compare a diverse set of machine learning models on a long-run dataset of more than 140 years in both out-of-sample cross-validation and recursive forecasting tests. Second, we are the first to tackle the black box critique of machine learning models for crisis prediction by identifying the key economic drivers of our models within a well-defined framework based on Shapley values, which allows us to interpret the rich signals these models learn from the data. As such, we overcome key challenges facing each of the two strands of the literature on financial crisis prediction: the constraints in exploring a broad range of nonlinearities and interactions in regression-based approaches, and the limited economic interpretability of machine learning models. Third, we uncover novel economic relationships which speak to the drivers of financial crises. In particular, we find that the domestic slope of the yield curve is an important predictor for crises, including those not preceded by recessions, and examine potential reasons for this in detail. We also identify the importance of yield curves globally for financial crisis risk. Fourth, we identify important interactions and nonlinearities of key variables. We find particularly strong relationships between global factors and domestic indicators such as the global slope of the yield curve and domestic credit.====Our paper relates closely to the extensive literature on early warning systems for crisis prediction that applies classical regression techniques or classifies leading indicators in a binary way according to whether they correctly signalled crises or generated false alarms (see e.g. Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; Bussiere and Fratzscher, 2006; Drehmann et al., 2011; Frankel and Saravelos, 2012; Schularick and Taylor, 2012; Drehmann and Juselius, 2014; Babeckỳ et al., 2014; Giese et al., 2014; Danielsson et al., 2018). This literature typically identified domestic private credit or credit-to-GDP growth and indebtedness as key predictors of financial crises, with more recent work (Alessi and Detken, 2011; Duca and Peltonen, 2013; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2019) also highlighting the importance of global credit growth in predicting crisis after 1970. Our results are in line with these findings.====The domestic yield curve is a well-established leading indicator for economic recessions (Estrella and Hardouvelis, 1991; Wright, 2006; Rudebusch and Williams, 2009; De Backer et al., 2019) and some have also explored the effect of the US yield curve on growth in other countries (Plosser and Geert Rouwenhorst, 1994). But only a few studies have linked it empirically to the risk of financial crises (Babeckỳ et al., 2014; Joy et al., 2017; Vermeulen et al., 2015) and these studies have not discussed this result in detail or examined the role of the yield curve on the global level. At the same time, our work is compatible with several theoretical models which investigate the relationships between nominal risk-free returns, risk taking, credit and financial stability (Aikman et al., 2015; Martinez-Miera and Repullo, 2017; Coimbra and Rey, 2017; Korinek and Novak, 2017). These models tend to highlight the importance of credit booms, particularly in a low interest rate environment, counter-cyclical risk premia and search-for-yield behaviour prior to financial crises.====A more recent line of work uses machine learning techniques for financial crisis prediction. Several studies apply random forests, a well-established machine learning model that uses decision trees. For example, Alessi and Detken (2018) employ them to predict banking crises in EU countries between 1970 and 2012, while Joy et al. (2017) use them to predict banking and currency crises in 36 advanced economies between 1970 and 2010 and Ward (2017) uses them to predict financial crises in the long-run Macrohistory Database and two post-1970 datasets.==== Other machine learning models have also been used to predict financial crises. Adaboost, with decision trees as its base model, was shown to be useful in forecasting financial crises in 100 advanced and emerging economies between 1970 and 2017 (Casabianca et al., 2019). Tölö (2019) shows that recurrent neural networks yield better early warning models than both ordinary neural networks and logistic regression in the Macrohistory database. And Fouliard et al. (2019) combine several predictive models, including regression and decision trees, to forecast financial crises in seven countries between 1985 and 2018. While all of these studies find that machine learning methods generally outperform a logistic regression approach in predicting financial crises, Beutel et al. (2018) reach the opposite conclusion based on quarterly post-1970 data.====Finally, the role of nonlinearities in exploring financial system vulnerabilities is also explored in the GDP-at-risk literature which models predictors of GDP growth in a quantile regression setting (Adrian et al., 2019; Aikman et al., 2021). This line of research finds that loose financial conditions and high credit growth can both affect the downside risk of GDP growth in the medium term in line with our results. However, we focus on financial crises rather than the worst potential GDP outcomes, which could be brought about by a range of factors that are not financial crisis related (e.g. a pandemic). Machine learning techniques also account for nonlinear dynamics in a more general way than quantile regressions, which provide linear estimates for different pre-specified quantiles of a target distribution.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and reviews the literature on those variables that we choose as predictors. It also presents a logistic regression analysis which helps link our findings directly to the recent literature and acts as a benchmark against our machine learning models. Section 3 outlines the methodology and briefly describes the different machine learning models applied and the Shapley value framework. Section 4 compares the predictive performance of all models. Section 5 investigates the importance of the predictors using Shapley values. Section 6 analyses the economic interpretation of our results in more detail, focussing particularly on the role of the yield curve, its interactions with credit growth, and the changing importance of variables across time. Section 7 concludes.","Credit growth, the yield curve and financial crisis prediction: Evidence from a machine learning approach",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000594,Available online 29 May 2023,2023,Research Article,5.0

We leverage exogenous variation in drug enforcement from the close election of mayors affiliated with the national ruling party during the MDW. Firms servicing the same markets but exogenously exposed to drug enforcement experienced lower export growth. The MDW decreased capital investments, eroding productivity gains in capital-intensive activities.","Export competitiveness is key for countries to converge toward higher living standards.==== Crime and violence are seen as important constraints on the productivity and welfare of developing economies. Consequently, governments spend significant resources fighting criminal organizations. In this paper, we show that a particular type of drug law enforcement policy – war on organized crime – can backfire and further erode local production capabilities. We focus our analysis on the Mexican Drug War (MDW), which started during the Calderón administration in late 2006. One party (PAN: ====) led the war on drugs, and the rollout of war efforts was influenced by the party affiliation of local authorities. As Dell (2015) showed, a close election of a PAN mayor led to a disproportionate increase in homicides during the MDW. Our first exploration of the effects of a discontinuous exposure to a PAN mayor using aggregate data finds negative effects on production growth that concentrate in the manufacturing sector. This is consistent with findings from the Mexican Enterprise Survey, which show an increase in the proportion of manufacturing firms citing violence as an obstacle to production in northern Mexico – the area of the country that experienced the bulk of the violence increase.====Because violence can affect both demand and supply, our paper focuses on local exports and introduces new elements to the regression discontinuity (RD) setting to identify the effect of violence on the local capacity to supply foreign markets. We compare the export growth of the same product to the same destination from areas where the discontinuous exposure to a PAN mayor is an exogenous source of violence. Using firm-level data on exports, we document that export growth decreases by an average of 21% as a consequence of a PAN mayor being elected in a close election. This effect is persistent and continues into the next mayoral term, with the 6-year growth rate in exports decreasing by an average of 13%. We observe robust effects on export growth only at the intensive margin. In the context of Melitz (2003), the main implication of this finding is that violence increases the marginal costs of exporting, while the potential increase in the fixed costs of exporting is not enough to affect decisions at the extensive margin.====A key goal of this paper is to identify the characteristics of the exporters most affected by the violence that ensued after drug enforcement operations, as well as the channels through which the MDW affected local export outcomes. Hence, we start by identifying the sectors that observed the largest erosion in export growth. We find that effects are concentrated in electronics, vehicles, and textiles. We then explore the characteristics of exporters and products most affected by the MDW and find that effects concentrate on large exporters and the exports of capital-intensive products. Lastly, we explore the channels through which the MDW altered export outcomes. As drug enforcement interventions induced increases in violence and crime, we focus on three possible mechanisms connecting enforcement with export underperformance: erosion in capital accumulation, resource misallocation away from production and into protection, and reductions in labor availability due to local disamenities. We find that the drug war decreased capital accumulation and capital expenditure in new greenfield investments. We also find evidence suggesting that violence increased the number of providers of private security services. Finally, we find negative effects on average wage growth and null effects on migration, both of which suggest that productivity drops dominate the disamenity mechanism.==== Taken together, our evidence suggests that the MDW affected local export growth by eroding the accumulation of productive capital, which in turn limited potential gains in labor productivity.====Our paper contributes to the literature on the economic costs of violence, crime, and law enforcement in several ways.==== First, we overcome endogeneity challenges, such as omitted variable bias and reverse causality (Dell et al., 2019; Dix-Carneiro et al., 2018), by focusing on plausibly exogenous variation in the local exposure to drug enforcement interventions. We show that such interventions can backfire by engendering an increase in violence that yields economic side effects on export activity. Most importantly, we structure our analysis to assess the relative importance of alternative theories connecting enforcement, violence, and economic underperformance. We show that drug enforcement erodes capital accumulation and disproportionately affects large exporters of capital-intensive products. Building on this result, we conjecture that these temporary drug enforcement interventions may have caused long-term economic consequences by disrupting the process of structural transformation and productivity growth.====While a broader segment of the literature has studied the economic consequences of conflicts and terrorist activity, fewer papers study the economic consequences of violence triggered by law-and-order interventions. The distinction is relevant because, unlike civil conflicts, law enforcement activities are common in a broader set of countries. The criminal activities that increase as a consequence of these operations are likely to differ from the violence that ensues during and after civil conflicts, as the organizations involved have different structures and objectives. A final distinction is that the effects of law-and-order national policies are not restricted to conflict settings, where political uncertainty also affects firms' economic decisions. Therefore, showing the unintended economic consequences of these policies – and the mechanisms through which they operate – is an academic contribution that can help improve the decision-making of policymakers in a broad set of countries.====Our paper also contributes to a growing literature on the effects of the Mexican Drug War itself. Velásquez (2020) shows that the drug war affected labor market outcomes; Brown and Velásquez (2017) study the effect on human capital accumulation; Ajzenman et al. (2014) documents impacts on house prices; Ashby and Ramos (2013) evaluates effects on foreign direct investment; and Lindo and Padilla-Romo (2018) study the consequences of the kingpin targeting approach. Utar (2018) shows that an increase in violence driven by the drug war generates a decrease in production for the local markets but not a decrease in exports; Montoya (2016) finds that the drug war affected firms of all sizes in the manufacturing sector and small firms in the non-tradable sector. Gutiérrez-Romero and Oviedo (2018) find a decrease in the value of production. There are several differences between these papers and ours. First, we are the first to show that the MDW exerts a negative effect on local export capacities. Second, while other papers rely on difference-in-differences or instrumental variable methods, our study uses plausibly exogenous changes in violence to find negative export consequences of the Drug War. This distinction is particularly important in relation to the null results on exports of Utar (2018). That paper uses the interaction of drug enforcement operations in Mexico with net cocaine cultivation in Colombia as an instrument for homicides in Mexico. However, it is natural to assume that government officials would strategically target certain areas based on economic and political criteria, leading to endogeneity in the cross-section of the treatment.==== For this reason, we believe our identification, which uses close electoral outcomes as a source of exogenous variation in the local exposure to violence, is a more plausible strategy to assess the effects of the MDW on local exports. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to assess the potential mechanisms through which the MDW affected local exports.",Export side effects of wars on organized crime: The case of Mexico,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000612,28 May 2023,2023,Research Article,6.0

Using the workhorse open-macro model, we derive a quadratic approximation of the utility-based global loss function in incomplete market economies, and solve for the optimal targeting rules under cooperation. The optimal monetary stance is expansionary if the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) on import prices is complete, contractionary if nominal rigidities attenuate ERPT. Excessive capital inflows, however, may lead to currency undervaluation instead of overvaluation for some parameter values. The optimal stance is then invariably expansionary to support domestic demand.","Cross-border capital flows raise widespread concerns about their potential adverse effects on domestic economies. Because of their impact on the exchange rate, domestic demand, and current account imbalances, inflows and outflows of capital may give rise to challenging policy trade-offs between internal objectives (inflation and output gap) and external objectives (competitiveness and trade). These concerns have generated a debate on the most appropriate tools for managing capital movements and their macroeconomic impact. They have also raised the need for a reconsideration of the role of monetary policy not just as a complement to other policy instruments (ranging from macroprudential policy to capital controls) but also as a first-line of defense in the absence of other readily implementable tools.====How should a central bank react to capital inflows that deteriorate the current account imbalance and appreciate the currency? One leading answer is that the natural rate still provides a reliable compass for monetary policy: to the extent that an external deficit raises the natural rate of interest, capital inflows should be systematically matched by a tighter monetary stance (see, e.g., Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2010).==== However, this answer may not be appropriate in the presence of both financial market imperfections and nominal rigidities. In this context, as recently stressed by Farhi and Werning (2016), pecuniary and demand externalities result in capital flows that are inefficient and exchange rates that are misaligned (i.e., over/undervalued).==== If a monetary contraction exacerbates misalignment, the optimal response to a capital inflow that overappreciate the currency may not even be a policy tightening. Is there a case for an expansionary monetary response that curbs the exchange rate overvaluation?====In this paper, we work out an analytically transparent characterization of the optimal monetary policy in the presence of inefficient capital flows, using the workhorse open economy monetary model—the two-country New Keynesian (NK) model under either complete or incomplete exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). As a standard and tractable way to introduce inefficient capital flows, we assume that the only internationally traded asset is an noncontingent bond (as in the seminal contribution by Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1995; see also Costinot et al. 2015). A notable property of the model for our purpose is that inefficient capital inflows may cause currency over- or undervaluation, depending on parameters values.====Our key result is that the optimal monetary policy response to inefficient capital inflows depends on ERPT. In economies in which ERPT is complete–the case of producer currency pricing (PCP)–the optimal policy is invariably expansionary. Under PCP, in the standard case when excessive inflows lead to currency overvaluation, losses in international price competitiveness redirect global demand away from domestic goods and worsen the output gap—motivating policymakers to lean against an overvalued exchange rate even if this comes at the cost of positive inflation. As a result, the optimal policy contains the magnitude of currency movements relative to the natural rate allocation (which in PCP economies could be achieved by implementing a strict policy of price stability). Real exchange rate movements are muted compared to those under price stability. The optimal monetary stance remains expansionary also when capital inflows lead to excessive depreciation and hurt domestic consumers—a possibility specific to incomplete market economies, when a sufficiently low trade elasticities and home bias in demand cause the wealth effects from equilibrium international price movements to prevail over substitution effects. In this case, the expansionary monetary stance supports domestic demand, even if at the cost of exacerbating currency depreciation and feeding inflation. Real exchange rate movements are amplified compared to those under price stability.====In economies where a low ERPT due to nominal rigidities in export and import prices mutes exchange rate expenditure switching effects on the output gap—the case of local currency pricing (LCP)—the optimal monetary stance is always driven by the need to stabilize demand. In contrast with the PCP case, the optimal stance is contractionary when excessive inflows are associated with an overvalued currency and a domestic demand boom, to contain domestic demand. The optimal stance is thus deflationary and exacerbates the currency misalignment. Under LCP, however, the sign of the optimal policy switches from contractionary to expansionary when inflows are associated with exchange rate undervaluation. In this case, monetary policy moves to support the inefficiently low domestic demand. As in the PCP economy, this comes at the cost of fueling further exchange rate depreciation and inflationary pressures. Under LCP, the optimal policy always amplifies real exchange rate volatility relative to a policy regime of strict CPI stability.====In developing our analysis, we make four novel contributions to the literature. First, we provide a second-order accurate approximation of the global welfare function for the standard New Keynesian two-country model with generically incomplete markets under PCP and LCP.==== The function we derive is valid for an arbitrary number of assets—bond economies and financial autarky are obtained as special cases—without requiring restrictive assumptions on preferences (such that a unitary trade elasticity or an identical consumption basket across countries).====Second, we characterize the optimal targeting rules under cooperation and commitment for both PCP and LCP economies.==== These rules hold for a wide range of shocks (including anticipated or unanticipated shocks to preferences, productivity, markups, etc.), but, unlike the global welfare function, are specific to a bond economy only.====Third, we show that a single welfare-relevant gap, a “wealth gap” combining cross-country demand misallocation with real exchange rate misalignment, indexes whether capital inflows are inefficiently high or low relative to the first-best allocation with full risk sharing. A positive (negative) “wealth gap” in response to capital inflows means that, because of imperfect insurance, domestic consumption is too high (low) relative to foreign, adjusting for purchasing power. In the targeting rules, this gap characterizes how risk sharing impinges on the trade-offs across (internal and external) objectives pursued by optimizing policymakers.====Finally, we offer an analytical characterization of the macroeconomic dynamic response to inefficient flows under the optimal policy. In our analysis, without loss of generality we find it convenient to focus on “news shocks” (anticipation of future changes in fundamentals) as these typically generate capital flows that are excessive relative to the first best.==== Notably, we show that in model specifications often adopted by the literature under LCP (see, e.g., Engel, 2011), capital flows in response to (news and contemporaneous) shocks are ==== to monetary policy. Not only this helps isolate the causal effects of inefficient flows. Also, it brings our analysis to bear directly on a case often debated in policy circles, where monetary policy can only mitigate the effects of inefficient capital flows on domestic macroeconomic dynamics, but cannot curb their size.====Related literature Our analysis builds on a vast body of work that, over the last two decades, has reexamined a classic question in open economy macroeconomics, concerning the trade-offs between external and internal objective (see Benigno and Benigno, 2003; Clarida et al., 2002; Corsetti and Pesenti, 2005; Devereux and Engel, 2003; Engel, 2011; and Galí and Monacelli, 2005, among others).==== It is nonetheless useful to emphasize two strands of this literature that help highlight our contribution.====The first is the literature epitomized by Engel (2011), who studies optimal policy under complete markets contrasting LCP and PCP in the otherwise canonical open economy New Keynesian model developed by Clarida et al. (2002). A key result under LCP is that the optimal monetary policy supports an allocation with CPI-price stability and no exchange rate misalignment—which also implies no cross-country misallocation of demand–the demand gap defined in Section 3.1 below. Indeed, under the maintained assumption of complete markets, trade in financial assets ensures that real exchange rate misalignment and the demand gap are ==== proportional to each other—independently of whether ERPT is complete (PCP) or incomplete (LCP). This is where our results differ from, and complement, this literature. When markets are not complete, misalignment and demand gaps are not proportional to each other—monetary policy will not be able to close both of them simultaneously, facing trade-offs between competing internal and external objectives. To best illustrate the value added of our results, we keep the focus on the PCP and LCP economies, the cases that have long be center stage in the literature on the optimal design of monetary policy in open economies.====The second strand of the literature includes a small number of contributions that, like ours, provide analytical characterizations of the optimal monetary policy in two-country models with incomplete financial markets.==== Obstfeld and Rogoff (2003) and Devereux (2004) examine static frameworks without capital flows, and in which prices are set one period in advance—therefore, necessarily abstracting from the welfare implications of current account dynamics and inflation. Devereux and Sutherland (2008) study a dynamic setting similar to ours, but in which markets are effectively complete under flexible prices so that price stability also attains the first-best natural rate allocation.==== Under PCP, Benigno (2009) emphasizes deviations from price stability, in economies in which net foreign asset holdings are asymmetrical in the nonstochastic steady state. However, the focus is on economies in which deviations from both purchasing power parity (PPP) and the law of one price are assumed away, in contrast with the analysis of real exchange rate misalignment at the core of optimal policy design analyzed in our paper. Our paper is also closely related to Farhi and Werning (2016), which provides a general characterization of optimal targeting rules in economies with nominal rigidities and financial market frictions. While this contribution focuses on the role of macroprudential policies when monetary policy is constrained, we focus on optimal monetary policy when macroprudential policies are not available—also explicitly taking into account standard welfare costs of inflation that stem from staggered price setting. Monetary policy with incomplete financial markets is also analyzed quantitatively by Rabitsch (2012), who revisits the benefits from international cooperation, and more recently by Senay and Sutherland (2016), who study the properties of instrument rules in a incomplete markets model with a portfolio of assets including bonds and equities.==== Finally, the case of beggar-thy-self depreciations associated with low trade elasticities in incomplete market economies, which is the focus of Section 5 below, has been recently discussed by Auclert et al. (2021) in a model with heterogeneous agents within countries.====Additionally, our study is naturally related to the growing literature that emphasizes the role of pecuniary externalities under collateral constraints, financial accelerator (balance-sheet) effects and over- and underborrowing relative to the constrained-efficient allocation (see Benigno et al., 2010; Bianchi, 2011; Bianchi and Mendoza, 2010; Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2015; Costinot et al. 2015; Dávila and Korinek, 2018; Jeanne and Korinek, 2010; and Lorenzoni, 2008, among others).==== Devereux and Yu (2016) characterize optimal monetary policy under discretion in a small open economy with occasionally binding borrowing constraints. Relative to these papers, a distinct feature of our paper is a focus on monetary policy in a global equilibrium characterized by overborrowing (and obviously underborrowing in the other country) with respect to the first-best allocation.====Finally, as regards the debate on the limits of monetary policy, our results are in line with Woodford (2009), showing that openness to foreign capital does not compromise monetary control, i.e., the ability of the central bank to pursue a desired monetary stance. Yet, as stressed by Farhi and Werning (2014) in a small open economy setting, inefficient capital flows may create adverse trade-offs across policy goals, hampering a central bank's ability to maintain the economy on an efficient path. We complement this work in that we inspect the monetary policy trade-offs created by capital flows, and characterize the optimal monetary response in the global cooperative equilibrium, when macroprudential policy and/or capital controls are not readily available.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly goes over the standard two-good, two-country, New Keynesian model that we take as the framework for our analysis. Section 3 derives the global loss function, discussing each of its arguments in some detail, and characterizes the cooperative optimal targeting rules under PCP and LCP. In this section, we also analyze in detail how and why incomplete markets make a difference for monetary policy. In Section 4, we consider a baseline specification of the model that we dub the Cole and Obstfeld (CO) economy, where capital flows are exogenous to policy and independent of ERPT. We can therefore focus sharply on how the optimal monetary stance changes across LCP and PCP economies. In section 5, we go beyond the role of ERPT, and further study how the optimal monetary policy varies systematically depending on the equilibrium link between misalignment and capital flows. Section 6 concludes. The Appendix derives the loss function, the targeting rules, and the different allocations shown throughout the papers, and provides proofs for the propositions and lemmas stated in the text.",Exchange rate misalignment and external imbalances: What is the optimal monetary policy response?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000570,Available online 25 May 2023,2023,Research Article,7.0

We document a widespread multi-fold rise in stockouts in nearly all sectors early in the pandemic. Over time, the composition evolved from temporary to more permanently discontinued products, concentrated in fewer sectors. We show that unexpected shocks to stockout levels have significant inflationary effects within three months. These effects are larger and more persistent for imported goods and import-intensive sectors. We develop a model of inventories in a sector facing both demand and cost disturbances, and use the observed joint dynamics of stockouts and prices to show that these effects can be associated with elevated costs of replenishing inventories and higher exposure to trade.","One of the most striking economic problems of the global COVID-19 pandemic was the severe disruption of the supply of goods to final consumers amid volatile swings in demand. Globally, these forces caused bottlenecks in shipping networks and disrupted the flow of goods along international supply chains.==== Domestically, the pandemic increased the cost of business operations, undercutting retailers' efforts to manage inventories.==== As a result, retailers and consumers faced shortages in a wide range of goods, from toilet paper to electronics. By early 2021, the persistence of shortages raised concerns about their inflationary impact, particularly in the United States, where prices were rising at rates not seen in decades, reaching 9.1% per year by June 2022.==== Although there is some evidence of these disruptions in manufacturing and ports, there is still no systematic evidence of shortages for retail consumer products.==== Furthermore, the degree of inflationary pressures associated with such shortages has been widely debated but remains unknown.====In this paper, we provide a direct high-frequency measure of consumer product shortages during the pandemic to study their impact on inflation. Our measure captures product unavailability and stockouts in the micro data collected every day from the websites of 70 large retailers in 7 countries—the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, and Spain—from November 1, 2019 to July 26, 2022. The dataset spans a wide range of consumer goods, including Food and Beverages, Household, Health, Electronics, and Personal Care products, covering between 52% and 80% of the goods consumption weights in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) baskets of these countries. The dataset contains prices for almost two million products, allowing us to exploit the rich time and cross-section details to assess the inflationary effects of shortages.====The paper consists of four parts. We first document the dynamics of temporarily unavailable products (“temporary stockouts”) and missing products (“permanent stockouts”) over the course of the pandemic. We then establish the degree to which stockouts co-move with prices and assess whether this comovement is stronger for goods and sectors exposed to international trade disruptions. Finally, we provide a formal analysis of the link between stockouts, prices, and costs using a model of monopolistic firms with inventories.====There are three distinct patterns of stockout behavior that are common across most sectors and countries during this period. First, there was a widespread increase in stockouts early in the pandemic affecting nearly all categories of consumer goods. In the United States, in particular, our aggregate measure of stockouts using CPI category weights rose from a pre-pandemic level of around 10% in 2019 to over 40% in May 2020. Initially, the stockouts impacted health and personal care goods, but quickly spread to other categories, with increases ranging from 23 percentage points (ppt) for “Furnishings and Household” goods and over 60 ppt for “Food and Beverages.” The level of aggregate U.S. stockouts recovered gradually over time, but by November 2021 it was rising again. In July 2022, U.S. stockouts remained at 25%, more than twice the pre-pandemic level. Other countries exhibit similar stockout dynamics, but the U.S. had the most persistent stockouts.====Second, the composition of stockouts changed significantly over time. Temporary stockouts, which are more visible to consumers because they are flagged by retailers with an out-of-stock indicator, rose sharply in most sectors and countries early on and then recovered rather quickly. By the end of 2020, they had fallen below their pre-pandemic levels for most countries. By contrast, permanent stockouts remained elevated in some countries, particularly in the U.S., where they were still at 20% in July 2022.====Third, stockouts became increasingly concentrated in fewer product categories over time. In particular, in the United States stockouts remained persistently high for “Food and Beverages” by July 2022, but had returned to pre-pandemic levels in other major categories.====Next, we show that these product stockouts were associated with rising prices in most sectors and countries. The magnitude of the dynamic inflationary effect is statistically and economically significant. We estimate that an unexpected doubling of the weekly temporary stockout rate from 10% to 20% brought about a 1.5 ppt increase in the annualized inflation rate in a 3-digit sector. The inflation response takes about a month to reach its peak and lasts approximately three months.====To investigate whether the inflationary effects are associated with global supply bottlenecks, we study the behavior of imported products and import-intensive sectors. First, using micro data from one large U.S. retailer with country of origin information for all individual goods, we show that imported products experience both longer stockouts and higher inflation rates than domestically produced goods. After a temporary stockout, prices of domestically produced products quickly return to average levels, whereas prices of imported goods continue to rise for several weeks. Second, when we compare sector responses to temporary stockout disturbances, import-intensive sectors experience larger and more persistent inflation, with roughly twice the impact of domestic goods after six weeks. Overall, this evidence suggests that costs associated with supply-chain disruptions during the pandemic led to significant increases in both product shortages and price increases.====In the final part of the paper, we estimate the cost of replenishing inventories by explicitly accounting for the endogeneity of stockouts.==== Building on Kryvtsov and Midrigan (2013), we develop a model of joint dynamics of stockouts and prices in a sector facing exogenous demand and cost disturbances, and use it to derive an empirical specification for estimating the underlying costs. We then construct empirical responses of sector stockouts and inflation to the estimated cost shocks.====Our estimation results imply a statistically and economically significant link between costs, temporary stockouts, and inflation. The estimated replacement cost dynamics resemble those from observed stockout behaviors, validating the idea of using them for gauging the emergent shortage pressures. Furthermore, accounting for the endogeneity of stockouts makes the estimated inflationary effects stronger immediately after the cost shock, but also less persistent. At least half of the estimated variation in inflation and nominal costs are common across sectors and represent “pure inflation.” The remaining share of variance can be attributed to sector-specific factors driving relative price disturbances. Global common factors reflect, in part, higher cost pressures on retailers exposed to international trade during the pandemic. Indeed, we find that both inflation and stockouts are more responsive to replacement cost shocks in trade-intensive sectors.",What can stockouts tell us about inflation?

While the rise in the number of billionaires and workers in the ‘gig economy’ has increased income spread, many governments have considered implementing a wide variety of redistributive policies to mitigate income inequality. What implications do these trends and policies have for product markets and individuals' well-being? How strong are these effects in closed and open economies?====These recent trends and policies regarding inequalities justify accounting for income heterogeneity as one of the most important features that economists should bring to their research agenda, especially in the context of monopolistic competitive markets. Indeed, income discrepancies are likely to affect product prices and product diversity in such markets. The reason is that income redistribution is expected to alter the elasticities of the product demand addressed to firms, which shall accordingly change their markup, output and entry decisions.====In this paper, we show that income heterogeneity matters for the outcomes of imperfect product markets and consumer welfare. In particular, we discuss the effects of income distribution on prices, markups, product diversity and firm output in the context of closed and open economies. We also investigate how such changes affect the welfare of different income groups and assess the quantitative importance of those effects.====A detailed discussion of the above questions is important for the following reasons. First, it highlights the limitations of the representative consumer approach, as market outcomes depend not only on average income but also on the entire income distribution. Second, it shows how firms make their price and entry decisions when income distribution impacts their demand elasticity and market power. Third, it qualifies redistributive policy recommendations because general equilibrium effects may accentuate welfare gaps between income groups.====To address these questions, we rely on a general equilibrium model in which individuals have nonhomothetic additive preferences and heterogeneous incomes. Individuals consume a set of varieties produced by a monopolistically competitive sector in which they work. The effects of income inequality on markups, product diversity, trade structure and individual welfare strongly depend on the properties of such preferences. Therefore, to clarify the direction of general equilibrium effects, we focus on additive preferences such that individual demand elasticity decreases and love for variety rises with consumption. This assumption combines the conditions for demand subconvexity (Mrazova and Peter Neary, 2017) and aligned preferences (Dhingra and Morrow, 2019). Demand subconvexity matches Marshall's Second Law of Demand according to which demand elasticities are high for goods with high prices and low consumption (Marshall, 1936, bk. 3, chap. 4, ====. 2), and corresponds to the empirical fact that markups decrease with market size (Syverson, 2007; Loecker et al., 2016). Increasing love for variety is claimed to be the most plausible consumer behavior by Vives (2001, ch. 6).====We set the stage by studying the effect of income distribution in a closed economy. We first formally show that market prices, markups, and firm sizes are independent of income distribution under preferences described by Pollak (1971). Such preferences encompass commonly used specifications like the generalized constant elasticity of substitution (CES), quadratic, constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) and logarithmic utility functions. Under these preferences, individual demands are locally linear in income so that any mean-preserving income redistribution reshuffles individual consumption in a way that each firm's demand and, therefore, its elasticity remains unchanged. As a consequence, markups, output and entry decisions are unaffected. We, however, show that the combination of Pollak preferences and monopolistic competition extends this result to arbitrary changes in income distribution, including changes in average and total income. Indeed, in the context of Pollak preferences and monopolistic competition, a rise in average income pushes the firms' demands up and, therefore, raises their markups and profits. The latter entices new firms to enter until markups return ==== to their initial levels. As a result, markups are unrelated to the characteristics of income distribution. The same conclusion holds for firm output. By contrast, the number of entrants completely absorbs the changes in average and total income.====However, the application of Pollak preferences in economic modeling raises several issues. First, these preferences are hardly supported by the data. Indeed, it is well known that the unit income elasticity of CES preferences is not empirically confirmed for many goods (Houthakker, 1957; Samuelson and William, 2010, p. 93). Additionally, Pollak preferences do not support any correlation between income redistribution and product diversity, which contradicts empirical findings (e.g., Falkinger and Zweimüller, 1996). Second, starting from Murphy et al. (1989), the macroeconomic literature strongly emphasizes the link between income inequality and total demand for manufacturing products. Such a relationship is absent under Pollak preferences. Finally, the latter relationship is also relevant in the trade context as empirical studies show a dependency between the demand for export goods and countries' levels of income inequality (Choi et al., 2009; Dalgin et al., 2008). This motivates us to study preference classes beyond Pollak.====To this end, we explore the properties of preferences for which a change in income distribution induces variations in prices, markups, product diversity, and individual welfare. Beyond Pollak preferences, income redistribution changes both the level and curvature of each individual's demand in a way that actually alters the demand curvature and elasticity of every firm. As a consequence, firms are enticed to change their markup and output. We show that the direction of the effect hinges on the behavior of the convexity of individuals' (direct) demand function.==== When this convexity is an increasing function of consumption, the individual expenditure of low-income consumers is more sensitive to price changes than is that of high-income consumers. Such a case is consistent with Bekkers et al.'s (2012) empirical observation that prices decrease with rising income inequality. In this case, as prices and markups move in the same direction, a redistribution policy that implements a mean-preserving contraction of income distribution increases equilibrium markups and fosters creation of new varieties.==== The opposite holds for a decreasing convexity of demand or a mean-preserving spread. While the latter result has been known since Foellmi and Zweimüller (2004), we further contribute to the literature in several broad directions: welfare implications, consequences for trade patterns, and quantification. We provide details on each direction below.====First, we present an intuition for these properties and further investigate the welfare effects of income inequality. For instance, under an increasing convexity of demand, changes in the product market generate negative general equilibrium effects on the welfare of poor individuals and may also harm richer ones. Under these circumstances, a policy targeting the lowest income decile leads to welfare losses for the untargeted poor. We also investigate particular classes of additive utility functions used in the literature. We show that the property of increasing convexity of demand depends not only on each particular class of utility function but also on its parametrization. This is of particular importance for the quantification exercises that would pursue to assess the economic impact of income redistribution.====Second, we discuss the effects of income distribution in open economies and shed light on the consequences of a country's income inequality for trade patterns and foreign markets. Indeed, the questions under consideration are also highly relevant in international trade contexts. Since Jones (1965), researchers have studied the impact of trade patterns on various income groups. However, the literature is limited regarding the reverse effect of consumer heterogeneity on trade patterns.==== For instance, income redistribution within one country may affect the markups and entry decisions of firms in other countries and may also raise or reduce individuals' well-being in those countries.====To address these questions, we extend our setting to an open economy where countries freely trade their products. We show that mean-preserving change in one country's income distribution does not affect markups and output for all Pollak preferences. For non-Pollak preferences with an increasing convexity of demand, mean-preserving contraction leads to higher markups and broader product diversity in the local market. In the other country, both local and imported good prices (and markups) decrease while product diversity expands. Therefore, we contribute to the literature by showing that international price divergence can stem from discrepancies in income inequality, rather than from the presence of trade costs and/or home market bias. Due to free trade, price divergence here is solely driven by individual income heterogeneity. Next, each country's export volume and value as well as its total trade volume fall with a reduction in income inequality in one of the countries. The opposite results hold for mean-preserving spread or a decreasing convexity of demand.====Finally, local income redistribution policies have welfare effects on other countries. For instance, all residents of the foreign country gain from the mean-preserving contraction of the domestic income distribution under an increasing convexity of demand. In the home country, the utility of poor individuals may, however, drop. Again, poorer individuals are more negatively affected by general equilibrium effects than richer individuals. These findings show how variation in a country's income inequality shapes the trade patterns and welfare levels of its trading partners.====We also find that Pollak preferences are no longer sufficient for maintaining markup invariance after a change in average income in one of the countries. In particular, markups do not vary only for CES preferences. This is a consequence of market segmentation, which takes place even under free trade. For all other additive preferences, domestic markups increase with the country's average income, whereas they fall in the other country under increasing demand convexity. This generalizes Simonovska's (2015) finding on price divergence in a framework with the additive logarithmic utility encompassed in our study. In addition, while firms in both countries increase (decrease) sales in the richer (poorer) country, their output does not change. Finally, total trade value increases (decreases) if the average income of a country increases (decreases).====Ultimately, we propose a quantification exercise calibrated to the US economy. In this exercise, we retain the preference classes compatible with empirical estimates of the elasticities of demand and pass-through provided in the literature. Despite these constraints on preferences and parameters, the exercise supports demand functions with both increasing and decreasing demand convexity and, therefore, allows us to present cases with opposite general equilibrium effects. We then study the effect of a redistributive transfer from the top to the bottom income decile. We show that general equilibrium effects are quantitatively nonnegligible in both closed and open economies. For instance, in a closed economy, a transfer involving 1.5% of total US income changes production and entry by approximately 2% while altering markups by 0.3% and changing welfare by up to 0.3% (as measured by equivalent consumption). Furthermore, the exercise underscores the relationship between pass-through elasticity and the direction of general equilibrium effects. For instance, a low (high) pass-through elasticity corresponds to an increasing (decreasing) convexity of demand. Thus, for low pass-through elasticity, the above redistribution policy increases markups, prices and variety but harms the bottom nine income deciles as the latter are more sensitive to price changes. This result is overturned with high pass-through elasticity. Finally, domestic redistribution policies affect other countries through trade. In particular, income redistribution in a country significantly affects markups, outputs, individual welfare and import-export values in both countries. Again, these changes are of similar magnitudes in both countries. Yet, redistribution at home can harm or benefit all deciles in both countries depending on the pass-through elasticity. This discussion shows that within-country redistribution policies substantially impact firms' choices regarding pricing and production, trade flows, and, ultimately, well-being of both local and trade partners' residents.==== This paper relates to several strands of literature. First, it is linked to the literature studying product markets in the monopolistic competition framework with additively separable preferences (Spence, 1976; Dixit and Stiglitz, 1977; Kuhn and Vives, 1999; Foellmi and Zweimüller, 2004) and with applications to trading countries (Neary, 2004; Zhelobodko et al., 2012; Kichko et al., 2014, among others). The paper also revisits a subset of the demand structures proposed in Bulow and Pfleiderer (1983), Mrázová and Peter Neary, 2017, Mrazova and Peter Neary, 2019, Mrazova et al. (2021) and Nakamura and Zerom (2010). Among them are demand functions with constant superelasticity, translog, constant proportional pass-through and constant elasticity of marginal revenue. This paper shows that those demand structures yield contrasting properties of the convexity of demand and therefore lead to opposite conclusions about the general equilibrium effects of income heterogeneity on product markets and welfare. Such contrasting effects may even take place within the same class of preferences for different parameterizations. Finally, the convexity of demand plays a key role in third-degree price discrimination (Aguirre et al., 2010; Cowan, 2012; Holmes, 1989). In contrast to our paper, the partial equilibrium literature shows that the properties of this convexity shape the welfare and output effects of market segmentation.====Second, there has been a long discussion on the impact of income inequality on aggregate demand through marginal propensities to consume (see Pigou, 1920; Keynes, 1936). Although a strand of this literature emphasizes the independence of aggregate demand from income distribution (Friedman, 1957, and followers), another finds a negative relationship between demand and income inequality (Dynan et al., 2004). In this paper, we uncover a very different mechanism that relates income inequality to aggregate demand through the entry/exit of firms into/from the market. To be precise, if poor individuals' expenditures are more sensitive to price changes, then an increase in income inequality leads to a higher aggregate demand for each variety. When the income of poor individuals falls, firm revenues become more sensitive to prices, which entices firms to set lower prices. This situation pushes a fraction of firms out of the market. As a result, surviving firms increase their level of production.====Third, this paper relates to the trade literature devoted to income heterogeneity. There exists a set of papers that investigate the impact of trade liberalization on within-country income inequality using a monopolistic competition framework. For example, Yeaple (2005) shows how trade widens the income gap between skilled and unskilled workers. Trade liberalization increases the skill premium paid by exporting firms using “high-tech” technologies in the context of a workforce with heterogeneous skills. Egger and Kreickemeier (2009), Helpman et al. (2010) and Felbermayr et al. (2011) explain the rise of within-country income inequality after trade liberalization through labor market imperfections and the presence of unemployment. Close to this paper, Fajgelbaum et al. (2011) discuss the impact of income inequality on the welfare of different income groups through changes in product diversity. They work however with a quite different framework with nested-logit demand and product quality. There also exists another set of papers that discuss the effect of between-country income income inequality on trade patterns. Fieler (2011) encompasses both per-capita income inequality and size differences in a Ricardian model with CES preferences and discusses their impact on trade flows. Using a Ricardian framework, Matsuyama (2000) studies the impact of income redistribution within a country on the wages and well-being of residents in both countries. Tarasov (2009) addresses similar questions within a framework with two income groups and indivisible goods as in Matsuyama (2000). Bertoletti et al. (2018) study trade patterns in the context of countries with heterogeneous per-capita incomes and preferences with income effects. Behrens and Murata (2012) contribute to both sets of papers, as they show that the impact of trade liberalization on the distribution of individual welfare depends on each country's relative per-capita income. This study is close to our paper, as it assumes within-country income heterogeneity. However, because this paper discusses CARA preferences, which belong to the Pollak class, market and trade properties hinge only on countries' average income and their relative position in the global income distribution. We deviate from these two strands of trade literature by studying the role of within-country income distribution in market and welfare outcomes within both countries.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the baseline model and identifies the equilibrium in a closed economy. Section 3 studies the impact of income redistribution on market outcome and welfare, while Section 4 extends the framework to the case of two countries. Section 5 quantifies the general equilibrium effects for different demand systems.

It has logically been subject to a growing interest both in the political and the academic sphere. A less obvious consequence of profit shifting is that it also alters economic measurement and ultimately the quality of public policies. In the midst of the Covid crisis in April 2020, Bruno Le Maire, the French ministry of Finance, announced that multinational firms with a presence in a tax haven and without substantial economic activity in these jurisdictions would not benefit from the State's financial support. Echoing scholars' views, this announcement was primarily made for fairness concerns.==== Yet, conditioning public subsidies to economic transparency also finds an economic justification given the bias in the measurement of domestic economic activity introduced by tax-planning strategies in tax havens as this paper shows.====Productivity slowdown has been a major concern in many advanced countries over the past decade. Some economists argue that we have been facing a demand driven secular stagnation which is characterized by low investment (Summers, 2014). Others have, instead, argued that we face a supply-driven secular stagnation, explained by the maturity of the IT revolution and the secular decline in the rhythm of technological progress due to the declining productivity of research workers (Gordon, 2016). Yet, some others argue that it is mainly driven by mismeasurement issues according to which current national account systems fail to take a proper account of intangible capital, product quality changes, creative destruction or even new “self-service” activities enabled by the digitalization of the economy, all of which underestimate productivity growth (Aghion et al., 2018, Haskel and Westlake, 2018 and Bean, 2016). These explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive and all may contribute to explaining the aggregate productivity decline.====In turn, aggregate productivity growth is closely related to productivity at the firm level. When firms become more efficient in transforming inputs into outputs, they contribute to overall efficiency gains. But how exactly do we measure productivity? And what role may international intra-group transfer of assets play in the measurement of firm productivity, and in the end, of GDP? Productivity measures are based, among others, on firm sales (both domestic sales and exports) and when a firm owns an affiliate in a foreign country, its sales abroad are not registered as part of the parent's sales. Neither are they accounted for in the parent's productivity, nor in the home country GDP. Although it makes sense to measure productivity in this way as long as the foreign affiliate produces abroad, it may not always be the case that production takes place abroad. Additionally, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are usually very big firms whose market shares are typically important enough to have an impact in the aggregate economy of a country. Thus, well measuring the activity of MNEs and understanding how tax havens distort national accounting is crucial when assessing countries' productivity.====To illustrate this, let us consider the hypothetical case of a French firm selling its products through a digital platform, for instance, providing services of big data analysis. The firm's research and development activities (R&D) required to develop its products are made in France, where it also pays its workers. When a customer in Germany buys the firm's services through the platform, the firm's sales are collected there where the firm has registered its property rights. In this case, it will be considered an export from France to Germany and it will contribute to the French GDP. However, if the firm, subject to a statutory corporate tax rate of 25%, decides to develop a global tax strategy by investing say in Ireland in order to move its intellectual property rights to a lower tax jurisdiction, its profits would instead be subject to a 12.5% tax rate. In this case, the transaction of these services would now be considered as an export from Ireland to Germany and the firm in France would see its sales – and productivity– go down. At the same time, its affiliate in Ireland would see its sales and productivity rise, even though the affiliate was not involved at any stage in the production process. Hence, the implication of the tax-motivated income shifting within multinational firms – or “base erosion and profit-shifting” (BEPS) is that activity in high-tax countries is underestimated while it is overestimated in low-tax jurisdictions.====Indeed, there is growing evidence showing that with the deeper international financial integration process that we have observed in the past decades, complex structures of MNEs aiming at reducing their tax bills, significantly distort official production statistics. Furthermore, there has been a deep transformation of the economy, with the digitalization of activities pushing firms to invest more in intangibles to the detriment of tangibles (e.g. Uber or Airbnb virtually don't own cars or buildings, respectively). This has resulted in a steady rise in the importance of intangible investment relative to tangible investment over the past 20 years, which, in major advanced countries, has overtaken tangible investment GDP share around the 2008 crisis.==== Although techniques to reduce tax payments within MNEs have been around for long, decoupling capital location from production and value location (e.g. intellectual property rights) and transfer-pricing (i.e. absence of “arm's-length prices” for intangibles) has become much easier with the rapid rise of intangible capital. Thus, beyond the deep financial integration that we have observed over the past decades, in a context of international tax competition, the increasing intangible economy has provided new tools for MNEs to offshore their profits to low tax countries.====Beyond measurement issues, which have long been a topic of academic debate and a concern for statistical offices, the social and political implications of tax evasion by MNEs have increasingly attracted public attention and led to the BEPS framework. This is a multi-year initiative of the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] and the G20, launched in 2012, to address the global fiscal challenges of economic digitization in order to prevent base erosion. Indeed, the growing discontent with globalization has crystallized in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and the perception that it has widened inequalities between elites - who benefit greatly from it - and the rest of society - who faces increasing pressure from international competition - has intensified with recent scandals such as LuxLeaks and Panama Papers. In a context where globalization is increasingly perceived as an unfair process in which the equality of individuals and companies is trampled before taxation, public discontent toward tax optimization intensifies with every crisis episode. Interestingly, one of the first claims of the civil society with respect to the reforms of international taxation was the implementation of a public database shedding light country by country on the economic activity and corresponding taxes paid by MNEs. This demand - which laid the foundation of the Country-by-Country reporting (CbCR) eventually implemented by the OECD - was not directly motivated by potential biases in the official statistics but mainly to improve the transparency on the tax paid by MNEs. The opacity and the measurement issues associated with the offshore world therefore appear to go hand in hand, raising the need for both political reforms and economic transparency.====This paper relates to the latter. Its aim boils down to a study of the relationship between micro-level tax avoidance, firm productivity mismeasurement and domestic aggregate productivity slowdown for the case of France. Beyond the novelty of the French case, we propose a new methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to quantify macroeconomic mismeasurement linked to profit-shifting based on micro-econometric estimations and without relying on assumption on the production function. In order to correct activities of US MNEs [Guvenen et al., 2022] use an apportionment formula while [Tørsløv et al., 2018] rely on the excess profitability of foreign affiliates compared to domestic firms to correct various indicators. Instead of resorting to a “normal” production function for MNEs, the adjustment technique used in this paper does not rely on proxies but on systematic deviations of firms' apparent productivity associated with the presence of MNEs in tax havens. Our identification strategy is validated by the use of the exogenous shock of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJE) and has the virtue of relaxing assumptions on firms' production function. Finally, we make use of simple aggregation techniques, standard in the industrial organization literature, to construct a counterfactual aggregate productivity if MNEs had not been present in tax havens over the sample period.====More precisely, we evaluate the contribution of the micro-level tax optimization to the aggregate productivity slowdown using balance-sheet yearly data on the universe of French firms and their presence in foreign countries over 1997–2015. Next, we aim at linking the firm-level productivity effect of offshore profit-shifting to the aggregate decline in measured productivity growth in France over the sample period. We identify offshore profit-shifting from within-firm variation in presence in tax havens, exploiting the precise establishment of firms' new foreign presence in a tax or non-tax haven country. Additionally, given that productivity may be mean-reverting, our regressions include initial productivity interacted with firms' trends, following [Fons-Rosen et al., 2021]. Thus, we control for any productivity decline due to high initial productivity, since this decline is not captured by the firm fixed effects or the sector-year effects.==== Furthermore, we evaluate the dynamic effects by asking whether the productivity differential for firms with presence in tax havens evolves over time after the entry in a tax haven and checking that the pre-trends do not exhibit specific patterns. Noting that firms self-select in tax havens, the entry in tax havens cannot be seen as purely exogenous and it could itself be linked to strategic decisions influencing firms' productivity. Even if our estimates are likely to be biased toward zero, providing, therefore, a lower bound of the true productivity mismeasurement, we reinforce the identification of the contribution of profit-shifting to the productivity measure by exploiting the 2006 Cadbury-Schweppes decision of the European Court of Justice.==== This decision restricts the application of Controlled-Foreign Company by member States and therefore loosens legal constraints for European MNEs with a presence in a European tax haven before 2006, which we observe in our dataset.==== Once we establish the link between profit-shifting and mismeasurement of productivity, we then explore two different channels: (i) the mediating role of intangible capital by splitting our sample between firms with high and low intensity in intangible capital and (ii) whether the mediating effect is opening an affiliate in a tax haven or having tax haven parent. Last but not least, we provide a macro-economic quantification of the productivity slowdown due to profit-shifting based on our micro-econometric estimates by relying on standard firm productivity aggregations, which allows us constructing an aggregate productivity counterfactual.====Our findings suggest that firm productivity in France experiences a decline over the immediate years following an establishment in a tax haven, with an average estimated drop around 3.5% in labor productivity depending on the list of tax haven used and 1% in total factor productivity. We argue that this productivity decline, following a presence in a tax haven, is most likely explained by MNEs' fiscal optimization, where domestic productivity is underestimated as profits are not recorded anymore in the home country. Additionally, we find that the mismeasurement has strong dynamic effects, as the decline becomes more important the longer the firm remains in a tax haven. For instance, we find that after 10 years of presence in a tax haven, ALP attains an average 11.7% drop with respect to the years before the tax haven presence, while the respective impact for TFP is around −4.8%. Finally, our findings are robust to the list of tax haven used and to a placebo test of the “tax haven presence treatment”. We are confident that these estimates rightly capture the effect of profit-shifting since the difference-in-difference (DiD) strategy applied around the Cadbury-Schweppes decision gives rise to comparable effects: depending on the specification, the “treated” firms who benefited from the loosening of the applicability of CFC rules experienced a 1 to 2% decline of their productivity measured in France after 2006 other things kept equal. Turning to the aggregate quantification of our results implies that the share of the aggregate loss in the level of labor productivity in France that can be explained by micro-level fiscal optimization of MNEs is equivalent to 6% between 1997 and 2015. This is tantamount to 5.7% of the observed aggregate annual growth in labor productivity over the period.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

This holds all the more when the home currency is dominant in pricing of ====.","Brexit and the Trump trade wars ignited a debate over the economic effects of tariffs, and the appropriate monetary policy response to the economic slowdown potentially induced by trade policy shocks. U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports rose seven-fold from 2018 to 2020, with little sign of any policy reversal.==== During the four years after the Brexit referendum in the absence of a trade agreement, uncertainty over trade relations with Europe dampened investment and production in the U.K.; even in the wake of an agreement implemented in 2021 trade remained hampered by increased regulatory requirements. More to the point, these trade disputes could signify a weakening of global consensus regarding free trade, and may herald a changed environment, in which central banks may expect in the future to face yet more examples of this new type of shock.====While these events have motivated a recent swell in research on the macroeconomic effects of trade policy, this nascent literature has mostly relied on real models ignoring a monetary dimension; among the subset of the literature studying tariffs in a monetary context, no one has studied the optimal response of monetary policy to tariff shocks. (See the foundational work of Barattieri et al. (2021), among others).==== Existing analysis emphasizes that tariffs exhibit characteristics of supply shocks, implying a fall in aggregate output and rise in aggregate price inflation. A number of contributions on the topic have indeed modeled monetary policy, but assumed Taylor rules with a focus on countering the inflationary impact rather than the output contraction. The New Keynesian literature shows that a contractionary monetary stance is optimal in the context of supply shocks arising from productivity and markup disturbances. However, in this paper we argue that tariff shocks are fundamentally different from other types of supply shock, and show that the optimal monetary response to a tariff shock is expansionary (or in some model specifications only moderately contractionary), with the goal of mitigating its adverse output implications, at the expense of aggravating short-run headline inflation. Thus the optimal monetary response to tariff shocks is the opposite of that presumed in the existing literature based on standard Taylor rules, or that implied by the New Keynesian literature with more standard supply shocks.====The fundamental logic is that tariff shocks differ from the supply shocks studied previously in the New Keynesian literature, namely, productivity shocks or markup shocks, in that tariffs raise the price that consumers pay on top of the sticky price charged by the firm. This is because tariffs are imposed on the foreign purchaser of an imported good, i.e., levied on the (border) price set by foreign firms. As such, the direct effect of a tariff is a fall in the demand for a firm's product (caused by a hike in its retail price), rather than an increase in marginal costs. To illustrate this point most sharply, we begin by studying a tariff shock in a highly simplified two-country monetary model, where we can derive optimal monetary policy analytically. The environment features two countries, one sector with differentiated products, one factor of production, and prices pre-determined one period ahead in the currency of the producer. We posit that tariff revenue paid by home households is rebated back to them, so that a tariff imposes no intrinsic resource cost. In this environment, we show most transparently that a fall in home production due to a tariff (since this lowers the demand for a country's exports) is inefficient. A monetary expansion is able to offset this inefficiency in part. The model also makes clear the optimal policy response to a tariff is the opposite of that to a standard adverse supply shock to productivity, where monetary policy lets output fall in line with higher marginal cost.====The paper goes on to study optimal monetary policy in a richer economic environment, which allows us to gauge the robustness of the analytical result of an optimal policy expansion, and to provide additional intuition for this result. The extended model includes features relevant for understanding optimal monetary policy, such as more realistic price adjustment dynamics, incomplete asset markets, and the addition of markup shocks. We also include features standard in trade models that may be important for understanding tariffs, such as international production chains, trade costs, and firm entry dynamics. We find that the optimality of a monetary expansion in response to a tariff shock is robust to realistic calibrations of these additional features. One feature particularly important to the sign of the optimal monetary response is the share of intermediates in production. In line with recent open economy macro, our model specifies a (highly stylized) value chain in production, in which imported goods are used in the production of exports. This implies that tariff protection of domestic exporters also raises the cost of production for domestic firms. Except for the case of economies where the share of intermediates in production is well above the norm in the empirical literature (in excess of 54%), the demand effects prevail---causing (ex-tariff) inflation to fall in a persistent way. Hence, the optimal monetary policy response is expansionary.====The extended model also provides additional intuition for why a monetary expansion is optimal for the case of tariff shocks, in contrast with standard supply shocks. When a tariff increases the price faced by foreign importers and lowers demand for home exports, the home firms would like to reduce their prices in line with wages and marginal costs, but they can only go part of the way because of price stickiness. Hence, PPI inflation moves in the opposite direction of CPI inflation (since a tariff is imposed on top of the price set by firms). This opposite movement in PPI and CPI inflation created by tariff shocks plays an important role in our model. A standard result in the open economy literature is that, when export prices are sticky in the currency of the producer, monetary policy should optimally focus on stabilizing PPI rather than CPI, since their relative adjustment corresponds to desirable adjustment in the relative price of domestic to foreign goods. According to the same logic, an expansionary home monetary response to a tariff helps redress the implied demand inefficiency by letting changes in CPI and PPI inflation (in opposite directions) realign relative prices (essentially, preventing an undesirable fall in the PPI). Contrast this result with the well-known policy prescription in response to an adverse home productivity shock. In such a case, firms would like to raise prices and reduce production: a monetary contraction helps facilitate this efficient output reduction.====Model simulations are especially useful for comparing implications of tariff shocks to another type of supply shock commonly studied in the macro literature, shocks to price markups. Tariff shocks differ from markup shocks in three key dimensions: (i) they apply selectively to export sales rather than all sales of a firm, (ii) the revenues accrue to the importing country rather than the exporting firm, and, most crucially, (iii) tariff duties are imposed directly on the importer rather than part of the price set by exporters. Because of this last point, a tariff shock drives a wedge between the prices at the border and at consumer level, and this wedge translates into a fall in the demand faced by firms. As producers respond by setting lower (border) prices, the shock produces persistent and inefficient (ex-tariff) PPI deflation. Thus, monetary policy optimally leans against the fall in (sticky, ex-tariff) prices. We show that the Ramsey optimal monetary policy response to a tariff, a monetary expansion, is indeed the opposite of the optimal response to a comparable markup shock raising prices.====The logic of our result applies to both the case of tariff wars, and to the case of tariffs imposed asymmetrically by one country. With asymmetric tariffs, however, exchange rate misalignment raises an additional trade-off. The Ramsey (cooperative) optimal policy redresses the misalignment by prescribing a monetary expansion in the country whose exports are targeted by the foreign trade policy, and a contraction in the country imposing the tariff. The combined, home and foreign, monetary stance causes the home currency to depreciate, so as to mitigate the distortionary effects of a tariff on international relative prices. This result suggests that a policy of currency depreciation in response to imposition of (one-sided) tariffs could be justified on the grounds of reducing distortions and promoting global welfare.====Further extensions to the model show that an optimal monetary expansion is robust to a variety of other concerns in the literature. For example, augmenting the model with wage stickiness can explain why measured PPI may not fall after a tariff increase, since market wages do not fall. Still, output does fall inefficiently, driving down the marginal disutility of labor at the ongoing wage. A monetary expansion remains optimal.====We also generalize our results to allowing for incomplete or asymmetric exchange rate pass-through and/or to a muted tariff pass-through from border to consumer prices. Remarkably, we establish that in a world of Dominant Currency Pricing (DCP), where one country issues a dominant currency in which world trade is invoiced, the different incidence of price stickiness on exporters induces a strong asymmetry in the optimal policy response even in a retaliatory, symmetric tariff war. The optimal monetary stance is expansionary in the dominant currency country, since price stickiness in the currency of producers makes it possible to redress the tariff distortion on domestic production via internal demand support and currency depreciation, while a weaker currency has a muted effect on imported inflation. The optimal stance is instead contractionary in the other country, since price stickiness among foreign exporters in home currency units insulates export prices from currency movements, while import prices remain highly sensitive to the exchange rate. As a result, only the issuer of the dominant currency is able to effectively redress the effects of the symmetric tariff through monetary policy.====In line with recent empirical evidence (Flaaen et al., 2020; Cavallo et al., 2021), a high degree of tariff pass-through at border prices may correspond to a very low degree of pass-through at consumer prices. As a final exercise, we show that an extension of the model including a distribution sector (after Corsetti and Dedola, 2005) can match the evidence, and that our results regarding optimal policy are qualitatively robust to this environment.====Our work is related to a number of recent papers studying the macroeconomic effects of trade policies in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. The seminal work in Barattieri et al. (2021) and Erceg et al. (2018) study whether trade policies can potentially serve as effective tools of macroeconomic stimulus in environments with nominal frictions. Caldara et al. (2020) investigates the macroeconomic implications of trade policy uncertainty. Lindé and Pescatori (2019) study the degree to which endogenous exchange rate movements work to offset the macroeconomic effects of tariffs and export subsidies. These papers share with our work the specification of a monetary economy, but focus on the effects and/or design of tariff policies in a macroeconomic environment where monetary policy operates according to a standard Taylor rule in the background. In contrast, we focus on the design of the welfare-optimizing monetary policy response of a central bank faced by exogenous tariff shocks.====Closely related to us are Auray et al. (2021) and Jeanne (2021), which share our focus on the interaction of tariff policy with monetary policy. Specifically, Auray et al. (2021) address the question of how alternative monetary policies affect an endogenous, strategic tariff policy; Jeanne (2021) considers a broad set of policy instruments set optimally by a government, including monetary policy and tariffs. This runs in the opposite direction of our question, the choice of optimal monetary policy in the face of an exogenous tariff policy shock. As already mentioned, the question we ask is directly motivated by the need to design an effective monetary response to trade policy initiatives best viewed as exogenous shocks, either imposed by a foreign country over which central banks have no control, or reflecting an unexpected shift in the political agenda of the domestic government. Further, the economic environments of our models differ. Auray et al. (2021) specify a standard New Keynesian DSGE model, whereas we consider a model with economic features found important in the trade literature, such as international production chains and firm dynamics.====The paper proceeds as follows. The next section studies a highly simplified model environment with pre-set prices, and derives an analytical solution for an optimal monetary policy response to a tariff shock. Section 3 describes a more general model environment and its calibration for numerical experiments. Section 4 uses this more general model to analyze the optimal policy response to a symmetric trade war, and Section 5 repeats the analysis for the case of a unilateral hike in tariffs. In 6 Tariff wars with dominant currencies, 7 Robustness to a low pass-through of tariffs to consumer prices we verify the robustness of our results when either exchange rate or tariff pass-through is incomplete, and study the implications of one currency being dominant in the invoicing of international trade.

This statistic is based on a single data moment, the change in the market share of continuing domestic producers, and a single structural parameter, the ====.","Seminal papers by Krugman (1980) and Melitz (2003) show that changes in trade costs can have important effects on welfare by changing the set of firms serving domestic and foreign markets. A large empirical literature has attempted to quantify the “extensive” margin of adjustment to changes in trade costs. For example, Broda and Weinstein (2006) measure the welfare gains from increases in US import variety and Pavcnik (2002) and Melitz and Trefler (2012) measure the effect of trade liberalization on the exit of less productive domestic firms.====However, Arkolakis et al. (2012) (henceforth ACR) show that when import demand is isoelastic, the welfare gains from trade can be calculated from two statistics: the aggregate trade share and trade elasticity. Conditional on these two statistics, it is not necessary to know the magnitude of the extensive margin adjustment to trade, even in models where the extensive margin adjustment is crucial to the welfare effect of trade.====The assumptions necessary to deliver an isoelastic import demand are quite stringent, particularly in models that allow for an extensive margin response to trade. Specifically, in such models, the extensive margin trade elasticity has to be constant. In a Melitz (2003) model this is the case when the distribution of firm productivity is Pareto and there is strict sorting into domestic production and exporting. Recent papers by Melitz and Redding (2015) and Head et al. (2014) consider alternative (non-Pareto) distributions of firm productivity that lead to departures from isoelastic import demand, but maintain the assumption of strict sorting into exports and production.====There is, however, abundant evidence that selection into export markets and exit does not follow strict sorting. Eaton et al. (2011) and Armenter and Koren (2015) document substantial overlap in the size distribution of exporters and non-exporters in France and the US. Fig. 1 replicates this evidence for US and Canadian manufacturing for exporters vs. non-exporters (top panel) and for surviving vs. exiting firms (bottom panel). Many exporters are smaller (as measured by employment) than non-exporters, and many non-exporters are larger than exporters. Likewise, there is a substantial overlap in the size distribution of surviving vs. exiting firms in the two countries.====This paper introduces a method to measure the gains from trade that is robust to any distribution of firm productivity and any pattern of selection into exporting and domestic production. Our proposed formula is based on one data moment, the domestic market share of continuing domestic producers, and one parameter, the elasticity of substitution between producers. This formula is essentially an application of the well-known Feenstra (1994) formula, albeit one that is very different from what is typically done in the trade literature. The standard application of Feenstra (1994)’s formula is to calculate ==== gains from trade using the expenditure share on continuing imported varieties in all imported varieties as the data moment (e.g., Broda and Weinstein (2006)). Instead, we apply the formula to calculate ==== gains from trade using the expenditure share on continuing domestic varieties in all varieties as the data moment.====We illustrate our procedure by using Canadian data to measure the welfare effect on Canada of the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA). The difference between the gains from trade calculated using our formula and that computed from the ACR statistic depends on the elasticity of substitution between products and the trade elasticity. We do not know for sure the value of these parameters, and when we use the range of empirical estimates from the literature, Canada's gains from the trade agreement computed from the ACR formula could be as much as 9 percentage point higher or 6 percentage point lower than our estimate. However, for our baseline values of 3.72 for the elasticity of substitution across products and 4.7 for the trade elasticity, our estimate of Canada's gain from CUSFTA is half a percentage point lower than indicated by the ACR formula.====Our paper further relates to three sets of papers. First, compared to Melitz and Redding (2015) and Head et al. (2014), our proposed summary statistic works for any distribution of firm productivity and for any pattern of firm entry and exit into exports and production. Second, relative to Hsieh et al. (2020), our focus in this paper is on the overall gains from trade rather than on a decomposition of the foreign and domestic extensive margin responses to trade. Third, Fernandes et al. (2022) and Adao et al. (2020) use firm level data to estimate trade models that allow for flexible extensive margin responses consistent with deviations from isoelastic import demand. Ours is an ex-post measure of the gains from trade and is silent on the structural parameters of the underlying trade model. In contrast, Fernandes et al. (2022) and Adao et al. (2020)’s method yields valuable structural parameters that can be used to conduct ex-ante evaluations.====The paper proceeds as follows. We first derive a sufficient statistic for the gains from trade that holds for all trade models with CES preferences, including those where the import demand elasticity is not constant and firms do not sort into markets based on productivity only. We then use micro-data from Canadian manufacturing to calculate Canada's welfare gains for the 1988 to 1996 period after CUSFTA was signed.",Gains from trade liberalization with flexible extensive margin adjustment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000429,31 March 2023,2023,Research Article,12.0

When factor utilization changes are unobserved, the commonly used Solow residual mismeasures actual changes in TFP. We use a general equilibrium dynamic multi-country multi-sector model to derive a production function estimating equation that corrects for unobserved factor usage. We compare the properties of utilization-adjusted TFP series to the standard Solow residual, and quantify the roles of both TFP and utilization for international business cycle comovement. Utilization-adjusted TFP is virtually uncorrelated across countries, and does not generate much GDP comovement through its propagation. Shocks to factor utilization can more successfully account for international comovement.","It has long been acknowledged in macroeconomics that the intensity of factor utilization varies over the business cycle. When some dimensions of variable factor utilization are not directly observed, conventional ways of inferring TFP changes, such as the Solow residual, can be misleading as measures of technology shocks. Thus, estimation of TFP shocks must account for variation in unobserved factor usage. Following the seminal work of Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006, henceforth BFK), it has become standard to use a utilization-adjusted series as a measure of TFP when studying the US economy. Importantly, BFK show that the utilization-adjusted TFP series have substantially different properties than the traditional Solow residual.====However, studies of international business cycles have typically employed the Solow residual as the measure of technology shocks. This approach makes it challenging to study the sources of international business cycle comovement in general, and to isolate the role of technology shocks in particular. Variable factor utilization in a country could respond to TFP shocks originating abroad. Non-technology shocks that produce a utilization response will also appear in the measured Solow residual.====Our first contribution is to develop utilization-adjusted TFP series for a sample of 29 countries, 30 sectors, and up to 37 years. To guide the estimation, we present a theoretical framework in which capital utilization rates, hours per worker, and workers' effort are endogenous and can vary within a period in response to shocks. The model yields an estimating equation that features a correction for unobserved factor utilization. The first main result is that utilization-adjusted TFP is virtually uncorrelated across countries. This is in contrast to the Solow residual, which is modestly positively correlated. Our findings imply that the cross-country correlation in the Solow residual typically found in the literature is in fact due to correlated movements in unobserved factor utilization.====Our second contribution is to quantify the roles of TFP and factor utilization in the international business cycle. A feature of our modeling and estimation approach is that we can explicitly separate the impacts of TFP and utilization on GDP comovement. We use the model structure to extract a utilization shock, that rationalizes movements in utilization conditional on the world vectors of TFP shocks and pre-determined variables, and world general equilibrium. While we do not microfound the utilization shock, it captures the effects of all non-TFP shocks on utilization rates. We then assess how much GDP comovement can be generated with TFP and utilization shocks. Our second main finding is that TFP shocks alone cannot generate much GDP correlation when fed into a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium model of production and trade. In the G7 countries, TFP shocks account for less than 10% of the observed GDP correlation on average. In the full 29-country sample, they produce zero GDP correlation on average. By contrast, utilization shocks are correlated, and generate about one-third of observed GDP comovement.====We thus conclude that the common approach in the international business cycle literature of working with TFP-shock-driven fluctuations is not the most promising way to fully understand international comovement. By contrast, non-technology shocks that move factor utilization conditional on TFP are considerably more important as a driver of comovement.====We estimate the production function parameters using a theoretically-founded estimating equation and data on many countries and sectors from the KLEMS database (O'Mahony and Timmer, 2009). The key intuition behind this approach comes from BFK: agents optimize multiple dimensions of factor use intensity simultaneously. Thus, an observed dimension of factor utilization – hours per worker – can serve as a proxy for unobserved dimensions of factor utilization such as worker effort. To account for the endogeneity of inputs to TFP we build instruments that combine oil shocks and military expenditures with the input-output network. Our quantification uses a multi-country, multi-sector model of world production and trade in both intermediate inputs and final goods. We calibrate all the country-sector input and final expenditure shares using the World Input-Output Database (Timmer et al., 2015).====Our paper contributes to the empirical and quantitative literature on international business cycle comovement. A number of papers are dedicated to documenting international correlations in productivity shocks and inputs (e.g. Imbs, 1999; Kose et al., 2003; Ambler et al., 2004). Also related is the body of work that identifies technology and demand shocks in a VAR setting and examines their international propagation (e.g. Canova, 2005; Corsetti et al., 2014; Levchenko and Pandalai-Nayar, 2020). Relative to these papers, we use sector-level data to provide novel estimates of utilization-adjusted TFP shocks, and expand the sample of countries. A large research agenda builds models in which fluctuations are driven by productivity shocks, and asks under what conditions those models can generate observed international comovement (see, among many others, Backus et al., 1992; Heathcote and Perri, 2002). In these analyses, productivity shocks are proxied by the Solow residual, which we show can be misleading. Our quantitative assessment benefits from improved measurement of TFP shocks.====Our estimation belongs to the family of methods that measure factor utilization. Complementing the more model-based approaches such as BFK and Fernald (2014), other work has considered survey-based direct measures of plant capacity utilization (e.g. Shapiro, 1989; Gorodnichenko and Shapiro, 2011; Boehm and Pandalai-Nayar, 2022), or used other observable proxies such as electricity consumption (e.g. Burnside et al., 1995). The alternative methods cannot be straightforwardly applied in our setting, as utilization surveys and electricity usage are not available for the large sample of countries, sectors, and years in our analysis. Our indirect measures of utilization are modestly positively correlated with the survey-based measures in the subset of countries and sectors for which those exist, although caution in such comparisons is important, as the questions on the surveys vary and do not closely correspond to the theoretical margin in our model. A literature in closed-economy macroeconomics going back to Greenwood et al. (1988) studies the implications of variable factor utilization for domestic business cycles (see, among many others, Bils and Cho, 1994; Cooley et al., 1995; Gilchrist and Williams, 2000; Fair, 2018; Chodorow-Reich et al., 2019). Closely related to the focus of BFK, Shapiro (1993) finds that variations in capital's workweek explain much of the cyclicality of TFP, while Galí and van Rens (2020) and Mitra (2022) document the fall in the procylicality of labor productivity over time and attribute it to the changing micro features of the labor market such as hiring frictions and de-unionization. Our paper builds on this literature by assessing the implications of utilization adjustments to TFP for international GDP comovement.====Our approach is also related to the large literature estimating production functions and markups (De Loecker and Warzynski, 2012; Ackerberg et al., 2015, and many others). This literature typically (though not always) uses Cobb-Douglas firm-level production functions featuring a mix of variable and fixed inputs, together with a control function approach which relies on only some inputs responding to contemporaneous productivity shocks to estimate output elasticities and calculate implied markups. The variable inputs are typically materials or investment. Our approach to estimating sectoral production functions is complementary – we assume a component of the labor input is flexible in a period, and use external instruments to isolate exogenous variation in this input. We do not separately identify markups, as our data are not at the firm level. Since we deflate output by sectoral price indices, our estimates should be interpreted as physical rather than revenue TFP.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out a simple accounting framework that illustrates the potentially confounding role of unobserved factor utilization in studying international comovement due to TFP shocks. Section 3 presents the theory behind our estimation approach. The results of the estimation are in Section 4. We assess the importance of TFP and utilization for international comovement in a general-equilibrium framework in Section 5.

We use a simple theoretical framework of risky quality upgrading by firms under varying levels of financial development to derive two predictions. First, the mean rate of quality growth and the corresponding cross-sectional variance of quality growth in a country are positively correlated. Second, both the mean and variance of quality changes are positively correlated with the country's level of financial development. We then test these two hypotheses using data on disaggregated (HS10) bilateral exports to the United States. The patterns in the data are consistent with the theory. The mean and the variance of quality growth are strongly positively correlated with each other. Countries with greater financial depth are systematically characterized by higher mean and higher variance in the growth of product quality. Our findings suggest a mean-variance trade-off in product quality improvements along the development path. Increases in financial depth do not imply lower variability of changes in the product space.","Economic development is unavoidably a series of wagers; the returns to investments in physical, human, and knowledge capital are invariably accompanied by risk.==== A substantial theoretical literature has argued that the evolution of a country's product basket along its development path (i.e., the evolution of the goods it produces and their quality) will depend on the relevant domestic and international institutions that allow agents to manage these risks. The lack of financial depth and the consequent inability of domestic producers to diversify risk implies that poorer countries will be less able to take on innovative but risky projects compared to rich countries.==== Do countries, in practice, differ systematically in the evolution of their product space? If so, what do these differences depend upon? This paper explores these questions by studying cross-country patterns of product quality growth through the lens of international trade – in particular by looking at the evolution of countries' export baskets over time.====We begin in Section 2 with a theoretical framework that describes risky quality upgrading by firms in economic environments characterized by different levels of financial development. Each firm has a choice of either producing a basic variety of its product with certainty, or undertaking a risky investment required for a quality upgrade. As in Kugler and Verhoogen (2012), upgrading quality requires the firm to use higher-cost inputs (which could be either more skilled labor or more expensive materials). Firms are risk averse and their ability to diversify individual firm production risks through the financial system will determine their production choices. With low financial development, risks cannot be diversified, and entrepreneurs consume the ex-post profits of their firms. Under a high level of financial development, firms will diversify production risks and thus have a greater willingness to take on risky quality-upgrading projects. The framework yields two results. First, the mean rate of quality growth (across products) and the corresponding cross-sectional variance of quality growth in a country are positively correlated. Second, both the mean and the cross-sectional variance of quality changes in a country are positively correlated with the country's level of financial development. This suggests a mean-variance “tradeoff” in quality growth along the development path. Rapid improvements in product quality will be more likely feasible in countries with greater financial depth.====Section 3 evaluates these theoretical predictions using data on disaggregated (HS10) bilateral exports to the United States for 1990–2000. Product quality is proxied by unit values.==== The advantage of using international trade data is that information on export prices and quantities is available at a much finer level of disaggregation than domestic production, especially for a large sample of countries. The implicit assumption is that the export basket of any country to the United States represents its technological frontier, and any domestic innovations in product quality are reflected in changes in unit values of products in the export basket to the United States. Further, given both our theoretical focus and data limitations, we focus on quality changes in existing products (i.e. the “intensive margin”), rather than the introduction of altogether new products (the “extensive margin”).====Both of the main theoretical predictions discussed above find support in the data. The mean of quality growth and the variance of quality growth are strongly correlated with each other. Countries with greater financial depth exhibit systematically higher mean and higher variance in the growth of product quality. To establish the causal effect of financial development on growth, we use two strategies. We first use an instrumental variable for financial development: the age of its first stock market exchange as of the year 2002. This variable is positively correlated with the maturity of the financial markets because well-developed financial markets usually saw their first stock market established centuries ago. At the same time, the exclusion restriction is that the year the stock market was founded only impacts the present-day export quality growth and dispersion through the quality of the financial system. Second, we use an unexpected shock to financial development, the Asian Financial Crisis, to estimate the impacts of a sudden drop in financial development on product quality growth and dispersion. We employ the synthetic control method to find a comparison group for each country affected by the Asian Financial Crisis. Both exercises confirm that the financial depth of a country drives its mean and variance in the growth of product quality.====Our results speak to a number of interrelated issues in the literature on economic growth, technology, and convergence across countries. It is well established that countries have not converged in their income levels – despite a range of theoretical mechanisms identified by the literature, such as international technology transfer and trade that could drive convergence. Our findings are consistent with the lack of income convergence across countries because they suggest that the combination of risk associated with technology upgrading and institutional weaknesses that prevent insurance against risk may be a barrier to technological adoption. The implied lack of convergence in product quality is also consistent with the well-known finding by Schott (2004) that higher-income countries exhibit a systematically higher quality of exports. At the same time, Wang and Wei (2010) show that a rapidly converging country like China also experiences rapid quality upgrading of its exports.====Our results also inform the literature on technological change, growth and financial depth, which has argued that technological change may be risky and that the inability to diversify this risk impedes technological progress. For instance, Doraszelski and Jaumandreu (2013) find that engaging in research and development roughly doubles the degree of uncertainty in the evolution of a producer's productivity level. Foster and Rosenzweig (2010) argue, in the context of small-scale agriculture, that “the incompleteness of insurance and credit availability play an important role in delaying the adoption of profitable new technologies.” Relatedly, Gorodnichenko and Schnitzer (2013) provide evidence that financial constraints affect the incentives of firms to innovate, which ultimately limits the ability of poor countries to catch up technologically with rich ones.

Conventional wisdom suggests that this relationship should be positive because both variables tend to increase in response to globalization; however, quantifying the exact trade-off between the two is challenging. This paper argues that while the cost of inequality in terms of real per capita income is high at low levels of trade, it declines with globalization and eventually converges toward zero.====I use a general-equilibrium model of trade featuring inequality and taxation corroborated by reduced-form evidence to show that selection into exporting determines the trade-off between inequality and aggregate gains from trade. I find that at levels of trade close to autarky, a 1 percentage point increase in real per capita income due to lower trade barriers leads to increases in three standard measures of income inequality – with a percentage point increase of 0.5 in the Gini Index, of 0.85 in the Atkinson Index, and of 0.92 in the Theil Index. As trade barriers disappear and more firms become exporters, the elasticities of these inequality indices with respect to real per capita income converge toward zero.====First, I use panel data to estimate the elasticities of average real income and inequality to trade openness. Preferred instrumental-variable estimates imply elasticities of 0.22–0.38 for real GDP per capita and 0.09–0.11 for the Gini coefficient. These estimates are valuable for two reasons. On the one hand, they establish that, for the average level of globalization observed in the data, the link between real income and inequality is positive. On the other hand, they also provide several useful benchmarks against which I can measure the accuracy of my quantitative model.====Second, I develop a parsimonious model of international trade and inequality featuring both heterogeneous firms as in Melitz (2003) and consumption, production, and income inequality mechanisms isomorphic to several leading models of trade and inequality. The model allows the relationship between inequality and aggregate gains from trade to be quantified at different levels of economic development, trade openness, redistributive policies, and social attitudes toward inequality. In this general framework, small changes in trade costs increase profits of exporter firms, which, in turn, increase the incomes of individuals associated with them. In an equilibrium in which few firms are exporters, a small reduction in trade barriers affects a relatively small portion of individuals in the right tail of the income distribution, which entails strong effects on inequality and moderate effects on average income. However, at high levels of trade openness, more firms are exporters, and reductions in trade costs increase incomes of a larger share of individuals such that the elasticity of inequality to openness converges to a positive constant. At the same time, as more individuals benefit from higher trade due to export-selection effects, the elasticity of real income to openness continues to grow. This means that more open economies realize higher aggregate gains from trade from reductions in trade costs conditional on the same changes in inequality.====Third, I discipline the model using data from 40 countries in 2011 to closely match actual levels of trade, export probabilities, production, consumption, average incomes, and inequality. Importantly, the model is also able to reproduce untargeted qualitative and quantitative relationships between trade, real per capita income, and inequality that are independently established in reduced-form regressions.====Next, I use the calibrated model to run a series of counterfactual experiments aimed at calculating four statistics: (i) the elasticity of real per capita income to trade, (ii) the elasticity of inequality to trade, (iii) the trade-off between inequality and aggregate gains, and (iv) percentile-specific income elasticities. Together the results of these counterfactual exercises suggest that the cost of inequality in terms of aggregate welfare is high when a country is close to autarky; however, the cost tapers off as trade liberalization continues, and it eventually converges toward zero when trade costs are sufficiently low. Current taxation and redistributive policies can moderately decrease the costs of inequality but their effects are limited. I also show that for a wide range of the social welfare function parameters, higher trade has locally positive effects on social welfare, and these effects are stronger at higher levels of openness. Hence, in countries that already are relatively open, the marginal gains from trade are likely to outweigh the marginal costs of inequality. Equivalently, using restrictive trade policies to reduce domestic inequality would entail substantial aggregate losses.====Two empirical results have been well established historically: higher trade leads to higher average real income, and higher trade increases inequality within a country. Though the two strands of the literature documenting these trends have for the most part developed separately from each other, this paper builds on both. It relates to Sachs and Warner (1995), Frankel and Romer (1999), Noguer and Siscart (2005) and, more recently, to Feyrer (2019), who has established a positive, causal link between trade and growth in real per capita income. This paper also finds parallels in the empirical literature on the link between globalization and within-country income inequality (for an overview see Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2007; Helpman, 2016; Pavcnik, 2017). I use panel data for 161 countries from 1950 to 2019 to confirm the main results of these two strands of the literature in a unified framework, and I contribute to both strands by developing a quantitative model that is able to reproduce those reduced-form results.====This paper also contributes to several strands in the theoretical and quantitative trade literatures. First, the results presented here are relevant to investigations into the relationship between aggregate trade and average welfare in models with firm heterogeneity (see Arkolakis et al., 2012; Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare, 2014; Melitz and Redding, 2014), as well as to research on the role of firm-level decisions about entry and exporting on aggregate growth (see Ghironi and Melitz, 2007; Arkolakis, 2016). I argue that changes in real per capita income should be examined against the backdrop of the corresponding changes in inequality.==== Second, to quantify the trade-off between real income and inequality, I develop a tractable model of trade in which income heterogeneity is generated by differences in firm-level profits. This mechanism is common to models of trade and inequality based on frameworks with heterogeneous firms and various labor-market frictions (e.g., see Manasse and Turrini, 2001; Yeaple, 2005; Egger and Kreickemeier, 2009, Egger and Kreickemeier, 2012; Helpman and Itskhoki, 2010; Helpman et al., 2010; Davis and Harrigan, 2011; Felbermayr et al., 2011; Monte, 2011; Amiti and Davis, 2012; Egger et al., 2013; Harrigan and Reshef, 2015).==== One of the advantages of the proposed framework is its tractability, which offers significant computational advantages; the framework can also be applied to the data on many asymmetric countries. These features are important for quantitative counterfactual analysis. In this paper, for example, I calibrate the model using data from 40 countries and run a series of experiments to calculate the costs of trade-related inequality in terms of the gains from trade at various levels of openness.====This paper also relates to the work of Antras et al. (2017), Galle et al. (2017), and Artuc et al. (2019) on the trade-off between the average gains and inequality costs from trade in different contexts,==== and to the empirical literature that studies the trade-off between growth and inequality (for example, see Alesina and Rodrik, 1994; Persson and Tabellini, 1994; Deininger and Squire, 1998; Barro, 2000; Forbes, 2000; de la Croix and Doepke, 2003). The focus of this paper, however, differs substantively from previous work, as I offer a quantitative framework to calculate the elasticity of trade-induced inequality to changes in real income per capita at different stages of globalization, while emphasizing the role of export-selection effects. I find that relative inequality costs are high at early stages of trade liberalization in terms of social welfare, but these initial costs are quickly recouped and outweighed by aggregate gains at later stages.","Selection effects, inequality, and aggregate gains from trade",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000387,22 March 2023,2023,Research Article,15.0

The studied bailouts prevent an exit and, thus, do not exclude subsequent defaults. The model replicates the experience of Greece and captures the coexistence of bailouts, defaults, and recession. It also sheds new light on the moral hazard discussion of bailouts by showing no significant effects from exit-driven bailouts.","The policy response to the European Sovereign Debt Crisis was in many respects unprecedented. The role of international lender-of-last-resort, traditionally occupied by the IMF, was taken over by the Eurozone countries and institutions. Greece, which received the largest share of the financial assistance, was not fiscally sustainable for a large part of the program's duration. According to the regular IMF rules, its fiscal condition would make it unsuitable for international credit lines. Nevertheless, Greece received three bailout programs amounting to €326bn, which exceeds 140% of Greece's 2010 GDP. Finally, while typical IMF assistance is designed to be actuarially fair, the Eurozone bailouts had favorable lending conditions. Those conditions can be interpreted as implicit fiscal transfers equivalent to over 40% of Greece's GDP (Gourinchas et al., (2020)).====Despite the substantial size and duration of the Greek rescue packages, the country went through a debt restructuring, the economy shrank by a fifth, and the crisis lasted for almost eight years. If the purpose of the bailout programs was to soften the Greek crisis or prevent the country from defaulting, then the programs have failed badly. But what if the bailouts were not meant to prevent Greece from defaulting but rather to prevent it from exiting the monetary union? In this paper, I explore the possibility of exit-driven bailouts and study their dynamic consequences.====In particular, I model sovereign default and exit from the monetary union as two separate but interrelated decisions. The framework follows the literature on quantitative sovereign default models originated by Arellano (2008) and is extended by a nominal friction à la Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016). Sovereign default eliminates the country's foreign debt but comes at the cost of losing access to international financial markets, leading to an output loss. Exit allows the country to devalue its currency to relax the nominal friction, without affecting the debt level. However, exiting the union comes with welfare costs.====Default and exit differ in their effects on the economy, but they interact with each other in non-trivial ways. Exit allows the government to introduce an independent exchange rate policy, which alleviates the consequences of the friction. This does not directly affect sovereign bonds, but the economy with a flexible exchange rate can support higher debt levels (see Na et al. (2018)). The higher endogenous debt limits reduce pressure on the government's budget. In turn, default does not directly affect the nominal friction, as the government does not regain its exchange rate policy. Nevertheless, default frees up some resources and increases the current consumption level of tradables. This temporary increase in consumption relaxes the nominal rigidity in the short run. The output loss that comes with a default, on the other hand, exacerbates the effects of the nominal friction in the following periods.====As default and exit are not substitutes, the government may also choose to exit and default at the same time. Then, the non-tradable sector can work efficiently and the output cost of financial exclusion is less painful. The option of exiting and defaulting simultaneously is especially attractive in the regions of the state space where debt levels and nominal wages are high. When the government faces a binding rigidity and low bond prices, there is no room for fiscal policy to relax the friction.====This rich framework is used to study sovereign bailouts in a monetary union. I assume that the bailouts are meant to prevent an exit, which means that whenever a country finds it beneficial to exit the union, its partners offer fiscal transfers. The bailout cannot directly relax the nominal wage rigidity, which an exit could achieve. Nevertheless, the transfers provide an additional source of revenue and create space for fiscal policy to alleviate the effects of the nominal friction.====For the bailout to be effective, it has to be high enough to make remaining in the monetary union attractive for the country. Therefore, the bailed-out country has to be at least equally well off in the union with a bailout, as it would be exiting. At the same time, the union wants to offer the lowest effective bailout, so it chooses a transfer that makes the country marginally indifferent between exiting and staying.====A quantitative analysis of the model captures several salient features of the European bailout experience. Similar to the timeline presented in Fig. 1, the first bailout is often not enough and needs to be followed by further programs. The bailouts can also be sizable. In over two-thirds of the crisis episodes, the total size of the transfers exceeds 10% of the rescued economy. Moreover, almost one in four crisis episodes results in the sum of the bailouts exceeding 50% of the country's GDP. Despite the substantial size of the fiscal transfers, they do not resolve the crisis but merely prevent the bailed-out country from exiting. The country suffers a deep and prolonged recession. The bailout is meant to avert an exit, and it does not exclude defaults, which often take place parallel to the bailouts.====As far as welfare is concerned, I assume that the union pursues the minimal effective bailout, i.e., in expectation, the transfers make the country indifferent between exiting and staying. Therefore, the bailed-out country in this model does not directly gain from the bailout. It benefits indirectly, as future bailout transfers can reduce the future risk of default and, thus, reduce borrowing costs. Therefore, the economy with bailouts faces on average lower interest rates and spends less time in default.====The possibility of a bailout in case of exit does not increase the average debt level nor the unconditional default frequency. The quantitative results contradict the concerns raised during the Eurozone Crisis that country bailouts would lead to substantial moral hazard effects.==== My work contributes to three strands of existing literature. Firstly, the paper relates to the literature on international bailouts and liquidity assistance in a monetary union, spurred by the policy response to the Eurozone crisis. Tirole (2015), and Gourinchas et al. (2020) explore conditions under which countries within a monetary union may optimally engage in bailouts. Ardagna and Caselli (2014) provide a narrative discussion of the actual Greek bailout arrangements. Dovis and Kirpalani (2020) study the usefulness of fiscal rules in a federation where fiscal transfers between regions are possible. I complement this line of work by highlighting that the sovereign bailouts in the European context could be related to an exit and not a default decision. This distinction has profound consequences, i.a., for the moral hard discussion, but has not been made in the bailout literature.====This paper also contributes to the literature studying sovereign default as a strategic decision (Eaton and Gersovitz (1981)). I follow the quantitative tradition of Arellano (2008) and Aguiar and Gopinath (2006). In this literature, my work is the closest to the growing body of studies that use a quantitative framework to investigate the dynamics of the Eurozone Crisis (see Farhi and Tirole (2017), Bocola et al. (2019)). The work of Na et al. (2018) sheds light on the link between defaults and devaluations by incorporating nominal rigidities in the model and providing a role for exchange rate regimes.They explain the high unemployment levels observed in the Eurozone. I extend their work by considering membership in a monetary union and studying strategic default and strategic exit from the union.====Finally, my research is related to other studies that consider the possibility of exiting a monetary union. Fuchs and Lippi (2006) analyze the consequences of the exit possibility on the optimal monetary policy in a monetary union. They show that the threat of exit generates history-dependent policy rules and time-varying country weights. Kriwoluzky et al. (2019) study default and exit within one framework, but in their model the decisions are exogenous. My model builds on the framework of Eijffinger et al. (2018), who study default and exit as two separate, but related decisions and show that exit rumors might lead to contagion within a monetary union. This paper introduces bailouts into this discussion, and shows how an exit could be prevented. It also studies the dynamic effects of exit-driven bailouts.====A key assumption of the model is downward nominal wage rigidity, which follows the work of Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) and Na et al. (2018). The former authors provide macro-level evidence for the importance of the friction in several Eurozone countries (including Greece) during the Eurozone crisis. Recently, there have been several studies documenting wage rigidity at the microeconomic level, e.g., Sigurdsson and Sigurdardottir (2016) for Iceland, and Grigsby et al. (2021) for US data.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces a model of a small open economy in a monetary union. Section 3 presents a recursive formulation of the model, which is followed by further intuition on the interaction of default and exit in section 4. Section 5 is devoted to the calibration of the model and benchmark quantitative results. Section 6 discusses bailouts in the model and analyzes their dynamic effects.

Oskolkov Aleksei,"University of Chicago, Department of Economics, 1126 E. 59th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA","Received 24 July 2021, Revised 7 March 2023, Accepted 9 March 2023, Available online 14 March 2023, Version of Record 28 March 2023.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2023.103750,Cited by (1),This paper studies the role of ==== in shaping the distributional effects of external monetary shocks. I model a ==== where agents differ in ,"The classical macroeconomic trilemma holds an open capital account, fixed exchange rate, and independent monetary policy as three options that are impossible to pick at the same time. When a country allows free capital flows from abroad, it must either let the exchange rate float or lose control over the interest rates. This trade-off has been studied extensively at the aggregate level, abstracting from heterogeneity in income and wealth. There is rich theoretical literature on the transmission of foreign shocks to domestic variables under different exchange rate arrangements. However, the uneven impact of these shocks in open economies has not been its main focus. This paper offers a study of exchange rate policy from the perspective of inequality.====I compare the dynamics of consumption inequality under different exchange rate regimes in a model economy that faces an external interest rate shock. In particular, I focus on heterogeneity in wealth and exposure to international trade: agents are employed in the production of either tradable or non-tradable goods. Exchange rate policy determines how the shock is transmitted, with potentially very different implications for individual households depending on their wealth and sector of employment. I use a small open economy HANK model that accommodates both types of heterogeneity to compare exchange rate regimes in the distribution of gains and losses they induce and delineate the role of transmission channels in forming this distribution.====More specifically, I concentrate on the interest rate and labor income channels. These are two of the most important channels studied by Kaplan et al. (2018), whose insights I mostly rely on. The exchange rate regime determines whether external shocks propagate mainly through domestic interest rates or currency prices. These variables directly impact consumption and labor supply of the workers through intertemporal substitution and disposable income. Intertemporal substitution is more important in the right tail of the wealth distribution, while current income is dominant in the left tail. Moreover, incomes are affected in different ways across sectors. This creates heterogeneity in individual responses. The heterogeneity then feeds back into aggregates, affecting total consumption and savings since the economy is open and trades goods and assets with the rest of the world. It also affects labor supply through income effects.====To study this heterogeneity, I augment a one-asset version of the HANK model in Kaplan et al. (2018) with international trade and foreign investors in government debt. Rotemberg (1982) adjustment costs prevent jumps in the price level, shutting down the nominal asset revaluation channel commonly present in discrete-time models. Workers do not save or borrow in foreign currency, so the potentially important revaluation channel studied by Ferra et al. (2020) is absent as well.==== As a result, the model is centered around the interest rate and labor income transmission channels, emphasizing their interaction.====I calibrate the model to Peru, using estimates for marginal propensity to consume provided by Hong (2023). Production block builds on Devereux and Engel (2007). Retailers sell differentiated non-traded final goods that they assemble from traded and non-traded inputs with a nested structure: foreign and home tradables are more substitutable than tradables and non-tradables. Inputs are made with labor, and all workers are employed either in tradable or non-tradable production. They face idiosyncratic productivity risk. Financial markets are incomplete: workers only hold nominal riskless deposits or take out loans subject to borrowing constraints. Banks aggregate their savings and invest them in the nominal riskless bonds issued by the fiscal authority to pay for government purchases. These bonds are short-term and denominated in the domestic currency.====International investors hold some of these bonds and can adjust their position at any time without cost. A positive shock to the foreign interest rate triggers capital outflows. One way to raise foreign currency returns on government debt and compensate the investors is to raise interest rates, keeping the exchange rate fixed. Another way is to induce an appreciation of the domestic currency. To do this, the monetary authority lets the currency depreciate on impact, which is followed by gradual appreciation.====The latter happens under float. Domestic currency depreciates on impact, which induces an output boom, raises costs, and launches inflation. Wages in tradables rise in response to the exchange rate depreciation that boosts exports and induces substitution from imports to domestic goods. In contrast, wages in non-tradables fall. This is because non-traded goods do not benefit from an export boom, while inflation causes an interest rate hike, with 40% of the shock passing through to the real interest rate in my calibration. This depresses domestic demand, which disproportionately affects non-tradables. The shock, therefore, opens a pro-tradable wage gap.====The total change in consumption inequality is small, but this fact masks two offsetting movements. The gap between the sectors widens, as workers in tradables are initially richer. On the other hand, inequality among workers in tradables falls, because the wage and interest rate channels work in opposite directions. A higher interest rate, which is more important for the rich, depresses consumption. Higher labor income, which is more important for the poor, increases it.====Under peg, consumption inequality increases. The country responds to capital outflows with a sharp monetary tightening, inducing shortfalls in demand and decreasing real wages. The wage and interest rate channels now work in the same direction, both inducing a contraction, but the labor income channel turns out to be quantitatively more important for the left tail than intertemporal substitution is for the right tail. Wealthy workers additionally benefit from a rise in interest income, while borrowers see their budgets negatively affected by rising interest payments.====The two sectors are affected in different ways. Wages in tradables do not fall much, supported by export demand. The non-traded sector does not have this cushion and takes the full weight of the demand shortfall. The resulting pro-tradable wage gap is wider than under float. The reason for aggregate demand falling so much is that the real interest rate under peg overshoots the shock. This is because the nominal interest rate has to match the shock exactly to prevent depreciation, but the real rate increases more since the recession is accompanied by deflation. Total consumption dispersion increases after the shock. The widening gap between sectors contributes around two-thirds of this increase, the rest coming from rising dispersion in non-tradables.====With wages moving in different directions after the shock, inequality dynamics in the two sectors are different under both float and peg. This highlights the importance of the source of labor income in accounting for the heterogeneous effects of external shocks. Cugat (2019) obtains similar results in a model with two types of households working in each sector: those with direct access to international financial markets and those with no access to saving and borrowing at all. Guo et al. (2020) incorporate this dimension of heterogeneity as well while focusing on heterogeneity in access to foreign assets.====I next study regimes beyond float and peg to explore the distributional effects of exchange rate policy in more detail. Fully floating and fully fixed exchange rates are the two polar arrangements. In practice, many governments and central banks depart from these corner policies, as documented by Ilzetzki et al. (2019). I explore policy rules augmented with nominal depreciation that may limit or amplify the pass-through of foreign shocks into the exchange rate, similarly to Cugat (2019). This convexifies the trilemma. Moreover, some rules invert foreign monetary spillovers and may react to a foreign tightening with a domestic easing. This comes at the expense of a larger currency depreciation on impact but potentially supports domestic demand.====In particular, I study Taylor rules with the nominal interest rate determined by a combination of inflation and nominal depreciation. The domestic real interest rate and real depreciation as functions of the shock and inflation are jointly determined from this equation and the modified uncovered interest parity condition. Rules that reduce nominal depreciation relative to pure inflation targeting correspond to “fear of floating” that Calvo and Reinhart (2002) associate with policies partly limiting the exchange rate flexibility. Rules that reduce the real interest on impact at the expense of stronger jump depreciation can be associated with “love of floating”.====I find that workers employed in the non-tradable sector are more affected by fear of floating. It might seem counterintuitive since the direct effect of fear of floating is to limit depreciation and hence wage growth in tradables. However, monetary policy in the model operates through aggregate demand. To suppress the real exchange rate, which is one of the prices, it suppresses demand, and wages in non-tradables are more sensitive to this. The reason is that in tradables, expenditure switching and exports act as a stabilization device. When domestic demand falls, the real exchange rate depreciates to shift demand from imports to local traded goods, and exports increase. This supports labor demand in this sector and hence wages. When domestic demand rises, real appreciation diverts part of it abroad, exports fall, and wages grow less.====As a result, when policy moves to less fear of floating, wages jump higher on impact, and the jump in non-tradables starts to catch up with that in tradables. Total consumption dispersion also decreases when policy moves to less fear of floating. Two factors contribute to this. First, the gap between the sectors widens less on impact. Generally, it widens because wages grow more in tradables, but “love of floating” dampens this difference. Second, consumption dispersion within sectors falls more as policy becomes less tight and causes more wage growth.====Finally, I consider the role of elasticity of substitution between different types of goods. Auclert et al. (2021) show that low trade elasticities make exchange rate depreciation contractionary because labor income gains from expenditure switching are not strong enough to compensate the workers for inflation that follows depreciation. I find that wages in non-tradables indeed fall more when elasticities are low. This is because under low elasticities relative prices need to adjust more to cause the same shift in quantities. However, for the same reason, more of the shock is absorbed by movements in the exchange rate, and less of it passes through to the real interest rate. Because of this, aggregate demand actually falls less than under baseline elasticities. Consumption dispersion, however, rises more, since the wage effect, which is more important in the left tail, is more contractionary under low elasticities, while the substitution effect is less contractionary.",Exchange rate policy and heterogeneity in small open economies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000363,14 March 2023,2023,Research Article,17.0

Research finds that both capital flows and exchange rates are driven by local and global factors, with the latter inclusive of risk sentiment and the monetary policy stance of reserve currency countries (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille, 2011; Forbes and Warnock, 2012; Fratzscher, 2012; Rey, 2015, Bruno and Shin, 2015, Kalemli-Özcan, 2019). The sensitivity to global factors is key to understanding the degree to which local economies retain some domestic policy autonomy and the appropriate macro-financial policy toolkits at their disposal (Rey, 2015; Obstfeld et al., 2019).====International capital flows tend to enter some advanced economies and emerging markets when global risk perceptions are low and global liquidity ample, and retreat when global financial conditions tighten. Amid elevated global risk conditions, risk-on currencies tend to depreciate and so called safe haven currencies tend to appreciate (Ranaldo and Soederlind, 2010; Botman, 2013; Habib and Stracca, 2012; De Irineu, 2015). The strength of global factors in driving flows and currencies vary substantially across countries and over time (Avdjiev et al., 2020); they are particularly strong when risk conditions are more pronounced (Chari et al., 2022; Forbes and Warnock, 2021; Obstfeld et al., 2019). The available evidence indicates that global factors exert more influence on asset prices than on capital flow volumes (Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015; Cerutti et al., 2019).====In this paper, we revisit these issues by recognizing that the observed responses of quantities of capital flows, exchange rates, and domestic monetary policy to global factors are interdependent and in many countries cannot be studied in isolation. In countries with fully flexible exchange rate regimes, exchange rates move quickly in response to incipient changes in capital flows, supplementing or even obviating the adjustment observable in capital flow volumes (Chari et al., 2021). In contrast, in fixed exchange rate regimes, managed floats, or even in some de jure flexible exchange rate regimes, central banks use policy interventions such as domestic interest rate changes and official foreign exchange interventions to reduce the realized exchange rate response to global factors (Ghosh et al., 2018).==== In such cases, capital flow pressures may show up in foreign exchange interventions or in policy rate changes rather than in exchange rates. Accordingly, viewing capital flow responses to global factors separately from the exchange rate or policy response will provide an incomplete picture of the actual capital flow pressures at play.====To account for the interdependencies between capital flows on the one hand, and exchange rate changes, foreign exchange interventions and policy rate changes on the other, we first present a new measure of international capital flow pressures, which is a revamped version of an Exchange Market Pressure (====) index. ==== indices are weighted and scaled sums of exchange rate depreciation, official foreign exchange intervention, and policy rate changes. Earlier versions of exchange market pressure indices have been used in a broad range of applications in the literature, from studying balance of payments crises (Eichengreen et al., 1994) to analyzing monetary policy spillovers (Aizenman et al., 2016b) and classifying exchange rate regimes (Frankel, 2019). However, the ==== indices have problematic features with respect to the weighting and scaling of the inputs, potentially leading to mischaracterization of pressures across countries and over time, as discussed more extensively in the Appendix.====Our construction instead derives the relevant weighting and scaling terms within the index through an approach that utilizes key relationships in balance of payments equilibrium, international portfolio demands for foreign assets, and valuation changes on portfolio-related wealth.==== Drawing lessons from the international portfolio balance approach follows a long tradition, from Girton and Henderson (1976), Henderson and Rogoff (1982), Branson and Henderson (1985), and Kouri (1981), to the more recent empirical and modelling innovations of Blanchard et al. (2005), Coeurdacier and Rey (2012), Caballero et al. (2016), and Gabaix and Maggiori (2015). The ==== framework thus ties into important research on the role of wealth and valuation effects in driving short-run international portfolio adjustments (for example, Gourinchas and Rey, 2014; Benetrix et al., 2015; Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2018; Camanho et al., 2015); the roles of currency denomination in portfolios of foreign assets and liabilities (Benetrix et al., 2015; Maggiori et al., 2020); the role of home bias in allocation of investment portfolios (Coeurdacier and Rey, 2012; Coeurdacier and Gourinchas, 2016; Maggiori et al., 2020; Faia et al., 2022); and the role of the sensitivity of portfolio allocations to changes in risk and return conditions (Bacchetta et al., 2022; Koijen and Yogo, 2020; Jiang et al., 2021; Camanho et al., 2015).====The logic of our ==== index is that international capital flow pressures show up in a specific combination of exchange rate movements, foreign exchange intervention, and policy rate response that can be jointly expressed in equivalent exchange rate depreciation units. The result is like a super-exchange rate index. Within the context of a fixed exchange rate regime, the theory-based equivalency formulas take pressures in the form of capital flows, absorbed by foreign exchange interventions conducted to prevent an exchange rate response, and provide the counterfactual exchange rate change that otherwise would have been needed to close the balance of payments gap and prevent the observed intervention flow. These constructed conversion factors, instead of using the scaling and weighting terms in the earlier indices, directly tie exchange rate changes, foreign exchange interventions and policy rate changes to well-known portfolio rebalancing and wealth channels through the balance of payments.====An important feature of the ==== is that it is measured in terms of exchange rate equivalents and hence is measured relative to the pressures of a foreign currency. This contrasts with data on realized capital flows, for which absolute levels are meaningful. Our baseline constructs the ==== as relative to each currency's own monetary reference currency, which in our sample are the USD and the euro respectively. We also implement and consider robustness to measuring the ==== against only USD and against an effective exchange rate basket of currencies using weights in financial portfolios.====We construct monthly series of the ==== for 41 countries for 2000 through 2021. A set of applications illustrate the importance of taking into account all the input components of the ==== for comparing and analyzing capital flow pressures across countries and currencies. While accounting for the different components reflecting capital flow pressures is relevant for the broader empirical literature, the focus in this paper is specifically on the link between capital flow pressures, risk sentiment and global factors.====First, the empirical measure shows the variation in the different components of capital flow pressures across countries and over time. Currency depreciation alone characterizes less than half of the country-month observations across the advanced and developing countries in the sample. The contributions of the different components to the ==== vary across periods with high stress in global financial markets and more normal times. Interestingly, on average, countries tend to allow - or to succumb to - even more exchange rate variability during periods of the most extreme risk sentiment, with significant variation across countries. This variation reinforces the importance of our approach toward accounting for the different components of the ==== in any cross country time series analysis, including around understanding the strength of global factors and viability of toolkits. The evidence also warns against general assumptions that the majority of countries either maintain fully flexible exchange rates or pegs, with our results consistent with evidence in Frankel (2019).====Second, we revisit the literature on currency risk sensitivities and safe haven currency status. Generally, currencies are characterized as having “safe haven” features if their valuations rise when global risk conditions worsen (Brunnermeier et al., 2008; Ranaldo and Soederlind, 2010; Habib and Stracca, 2012, and Fatum and Yamamoto, 2016).==== Our evidence about the prevalence of other components in computing international capital flow pressures suggests that some empirical analyses that are based exclusively on observed exchange rate movements may generate results that are both imprecise and subject to attenuation bias: these analyses miss the fact that many countries respond to currency pressures by intervening in the foreign exchange market or changing the policy rate, in addition to allowing some exchange rate adjustment.==== Indeed, on average, exchange rate adjustments capture more - not less - of the international capital flow pressure during the most extreme stress periods.====To account for attenuation bias in assessing safe haven currencies, we instead use the ==== and assess its rolling correlation across time with global risk sentiment, labelling the result as the Global Risk Response index (====). The data designate the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen and US dollar as key safe haven currencies, and add the Danish krone and the Hong Kong Dollar. The latter currencies are characterized by managed exchange rate regimes, so accounting for foreign exchange interventions and policy rate adjustments in the response to risk are key to reflecting their tendencies to attract net capital inflows.====Finally, we use the ==== to revisit questions of which underlying factors are associated with currencies exhibiting safe haven features, using the regression approaches of the literature. The analysis suggests that safe haven features of currencies tend to be persistent. Empirically, these features are associated with self-fulling expectations of currency movements based on previous associations between capital flow pressures and risk, as well as interest rate levels, suggesting that carry trade funding currencies tend toward appearing as safe-haven currencies. In contrast, the current macroeconomic characteristics of countries as typically investigated in the literature are less consistently significant in capturing safe-haven features.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the exchange market pressure index and discusses the intuition behind the index. Section 3 focuses on empirical implementation, presenting important data and explaining parameter choices. Section 4 illustrates the variation in the different components of the index across countries and across high stress and normal risk periods, and provides the application to safe haven currency status and its drivers. The final section discusses the implications of our findings and concludes.",International capital flow pressures and global factors,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000351,Available online 11 March 2023,2023,Research Article,18.0

One aspect that the literature has mostly overlooked so far is the significant heterogeneity there is across banks in their foreign operations, with some large banks having business in many countries while others do not operate abroad at all. This paper hones in on this aspect, embedding bank heterogeneity in a model of banking across borders. The proposed model, which is consistent with key aspects of the data, shows how bank heterogeneity matters for the effects of banking sector liberalization, highlighting that theoretically this dimension should not be ignored when studying international banking and its implications. The paper also employs foreign exposures data, and, through a model-guided empirical approach, uncovers new stylized facts on patterns and heterogeneity in international bank operations.====The proposed general equilibrium model of trade in banking services and financial sector foreign direct investment (FDI) is based on the observation that bank efficiency is a key determinant of banks' foreign operations. As Fig. 2 shows, which draws on bank-level data from the Deutsche Bundesbank, German banks with foreign operations have lower overhead costs to total assets—an inverse measure of efficiency—than the average bank. The same sorting also holds with other measures of bank efficiency.==== At the same time, banks with foreign business are larger and, as this paper establishes, operate with higher leverage (measured as total assets over book equity).==== Accordingly, the model connects banks' efficiencies to their size, leverage, and internationalization.====The micro structure of the model resembles Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) with double-sided moral hazard. Banks have two roles in the economy. First, they channel capital from depositors to firms. Second, they monitor firms at a cost. Whether banks monitor is not observable by depositors so to credibly commit to monitor, banks invest their own capital in the firms they lend to. Banks with lower monitoring costs are able to intermediate more external capital for the same amount of equity capital, and are, therefore, larger, operate with higher leverage, and make higher profits.====This microstructure carries over to the open economy setup with two countries. In line with Niepmann (2015), banking across borders arises from differences in marginal products of capital and banking sector efficiencies between countries. These differences cause the return on loans that banks earn and the rate on deposits they pay to vary between the home and the foreign country. As banks operate internationally, they choose where to raise deposits and lend to maximize the return on loans and minimize funding costs.====When operating abroad, banks have a choice between different activities and modes of operation. They can engage in ==== and ====, which are distinct activities in the model, meaning they extend cross-border loans to foreign firms or borrow cross-border from foreign depositors. They can also intermediate funds locally in the foreign market (====), which does not involve a reallocation of capital across countries. Furthermore, banks have a choice between operating at arm's length or through an affiliate abroad (which is equivalent to engaging in ====). It is assumed that the fixed costs of cross-border lending and borrowing are lower than the fixed cost of FDI and that banks save on variable costs by opening up a foreign affiliate. As more efficient banks have larger lending volumes and make higher profits, only they are able to cover the higher fixed costs. Therefore sorting occurs: the most efficient banks establish foreign affiliates abroad, while less efficient banks engage only in cross-border lending and borrowing. Banks at the lower end of the efficiency distribution remain domestic.====When the two banking sectors become integrated and banks borrow and lend across borders, intermediation costs and returns to capital converge. Banks channel capital from the capital abundant/low technology country to the capital scarce/high technology country. At the same time, they expand to bring lower-cost financial services to the country with less efficient banks. In the country that hosts the more efficient banking sector, new banks enter. In the other country, the least efficient banks exit as foreign banks intermediate local deposits. How many banks operate abroad in equilibrium depends, among other things, on the relative efficiencies of the integrating banking sectors and on the costs of operating across borders. Keeping home country characteristics fixed, the number of banks that are active abroad increases with the size of the foreign country and decreases with the efficiency of the foreign banking sector as well as the fixed and variable costs of operating there.====Data from the Deutsche Bundesbank for the year 2005 on the external positions of banks and bank balance sheets is used to establish additional stylized facts on bank heterogeneity and internationalization, while exploring the predictions of the model.==== Unlike U.S. foreign exposure data, for example, there are no reporting thresholds for German banks' foreign exposures. Therefore, the data contain detailed information on the foreign activities of all German banks and their affiliates in a large number of countries.====Employing these unique data, the paper establishes several new stylized facts. First, cross-border activity is very prevalent. 99% of German banks have assets in foreign countries. That said, most banks have assets and liabilities in only a handful of countries. The most internationally active German banks instead cover more than 150 countries. Second, operating affiliates abroad is much less common. Only 2.6% of German banks have affiliates and these affiliates span only 58 different countries. Third, as highlighted earlier through Fig. 2 and consistent with the theoretical result on sorting, banks sort into international operations according to their overhead costs. Fourth, bank leverage similarly relates to banks' foreign operations. More highly levered banks are more likely to engage in cross-border lending and borrowing, and FDI, and, conditional on operating abroad, have larger foreign assets and liabilities.====The paper further explores the role of foreign country characteristics for the operations of German banks guided by the model predictions. Logit regressions show that German banks are more likely to operate in countries with a larger GDP, a less efficient banking sector, higher bureaucratic quality and financial freedom and a smaller geographic distance. To highlight the strong sorting of banks on host country characteristics, the average efficiency of German banks that operate in various foreign countries is computed and regressed on host country characteristics. As the theory prescribes, the average efficiency of German banks that operate abroad increases with impediments to operating in the host country and decreases with a larger GDP and a less efficient banking sector. The fact that the average efficiency of banks that operate in a country increases with the efficiency of the banking sector in the country strongly suggests that differences in intermediation costs across countries are a key driver of banking across borders. In addition, the stark sorting pattern indicates that foreign bank activities are associated with substantial fixed costs, which only banks with larger operating volumes are able to overcome, in line with the model.====Besides documenting these new stylized facts on international banking from model-derived predictions, the data are also used to motivate a simulation of the model. In the simulation, the German banking sector integrates with the Czech banking sector, which is, as many other Eastern European banking sectors, dominated by major banking groups from Western European countries. In the example, Germany hosts the more efficient banking sector while the return to capital is higher in Germany than in the Czech Republic. When the countries open up their banking sectors for international banking, the more efficient (German) banking sector grows while the less efficient (Czech) banking sector shrinks. Because (German) banks that go abroad increase their return on loans and lower their funding costs, their balance sheets expand. Since only the largest banks are active abroad, banking sector integration makes the large banks even larger. At the same time, as returns to capital and deposit rates adjust, bank leverage and size change for all banks. Overall, the equilibrium bank size distribution tends to become more unequal with banking sector intergration.====Simulating the model for different distributions of bank efficiency shows that the benefits of banking sector integration depend on the degree of bank heterogeneity in the liberalizing countries. Heterogeneity affects equilibrium net interest rate margins, capital flows and, ultimately, determines the gains from opening up. This highlights the relevance of taking efficiency and size differences across banks into account when analyzing international banking and its implications.====To explore the model's insights for policy, the paper analyzes the implications of leverage constraints for banking across borders. On the one hand, leverage constraints may discourage banks from operating across borders. The increase in profits from foreign activities has to be sufficiently high to cover the associated fixed costs, and leverage constraints limit by how much banks can lever up and increase profits by operating abroad. This suggests a potential trade-off between ensuring financial stability, which leverage constaints aim at, and reaping the benefits of banking sector globalization. On the other hand, differences in regulation can generate banking across borders even between identical countries when foreign banks are not subject to the same regulation as home banks. In this light, harmonization of capital regulation seems desirable.====The model proposed in this paper is very stylized. Banks only differ with respect to their efficiency, channeling funds from depositors to firms. There is no role for insured deposits or public bail-outs and no reason for capital regulation (the leverage constraints in the policy experiment is exogenously imposed). However, safety nets and capital regulation are key factors determining banks' levels of capitalization (see, for example, Jiang et al. (2020a)). Exploring the internationalization of banks in a richer banking model with deposit insurance and endogenous capital regulation is a key target for future research. Future models should also consider including a market for bank equity and a role for diversification. In the presented model, banks are endowed with equity, which does not trade. This ensures that heterogeneous banks exist, but it also implies that banks cannot raise additional equity to expand abroad, as banks often do. At the same time, while countries differ with respect to their returns on capital, returns are perfectly correlated across countries. In reality, banks reap diversification benefits from operating in different countries.==== This research contributes to the small but growing literature on cross-border banking. Similar to Niepmann (2015), this paper takes a trade approach where differences in relative factor endowments and financial intermediation technologies across countries drive banking across borders. In contrast to the aforementioned work, the framework presented here exhibits imperfect competition and allows for bank-level heterogeneity.====A few other papers also study the effects of increased competition and banking sector integration in the presence of heterogeneous banks. Ennis (2001) incorporates a moral hazard problem at the side of bankers in a multi-regional banking model, focussing on the effect of integration on the size distribution of banks. In his model, banks differ with respect to equity, in contrast to the efficiency differences modeled here. Banking across regions allows the bank with the largest equity to diversify lending, which relaxes information problems and increases profits.====De Blas and Russ, 2010, De Blas and Russ, 2013 study the effects of financial liberalization in the form of cross-border takeovers versus cross-border lending on banks' loan pricing and the distribution of markups.==== The former paper analyzes a structure where banks offer differentiated services in line with Bernard et al. (2003). In the latter work, customers optimally match with banks with different efficiencies. The paper finds that both policies can increase aggregate output.====Corbae and D'Erasmo (2010) propose a DSGE model to study the effect of bank competition on bank market structure, entry and exit and the riskiness of bank loans along the business cycle, distinguishing between regional and global banks. In an application of that model, Corbae and D'Erasmo (2015) evaluate the welfare effects of foreign bank entry in Mexico. Fillat et al. (2018) provide a structural model with bank heterogeneity, analyzing how banks' mode of entry (through either branches or subsidiaries) affects the transmission of foreign shocks to the United States. Kerl and Niepmann (2015) simplify the model in this paper to explain the sectoral composition of international bank flows, distinguishing between interbank market activity and cross-border business with non-banking firms and households. Cao et al. (2021) propose a model where multinational banks have a disadvantage in lending in the host country to study how multinational banks shape the dynamics of business cycles in the host country finding that they can act stabilizing as well as destabilizing.====More broadly this research adds to the literature on heterogeneous firms in international trade and investment.==== The proposed theoretical structure differs substantially from existing work-horse models with firm heterogeneity. In the class of models following Melitz (2003), heterogeneous manufacturing firms produce differentiated goods as a result of consumers' love for variety, and labor, the only production factor, is immobile. In this paper instead, banks provide a homogenous intermediation service and move capital across borders. In this regard, this work also contributes to services trade research (see Francois and Hoekman (2010) for a literature review).====The assumptions on fixed and variables costs that banks face follow Helpman et al. (2004) and result in a similar concentration-fixed-cost tradeoff here. Buch et al. (2014) and Lehner (2009) model such a tradeoff for banks in partial equilibrium frameworks in contrast to the general equilibrium approach in this paper.====This work also extends the empirical literature on cross-border banking. Several papers have analyzed how country characteristics affect the foreign activities of banks (see, for example, Papaioannou (2009); Buch (2003); Buch (2005); Focarelli and Pozzolo (2005)). Niepmann (2015) shows that the foreign positions of banks are determined by differences in relative factor endowments and banking sector efficiencies between countries. Buch et al. (2011) introduce the dataset explored in this paper, documenting that the foreign operations of German banks vary systematically with their size and productivity.==== The empirical analysis in this paper complements these works, in particular by analyzing the sorting of banks into foreign activities based on host country characteristics.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the closed economy model. Section 3 discusses the open economy setup. Section 4 solves the model analytically and simulates it for the case where relative factor endowments and production technologies are the same across countries. Section 5 explores patterns in the German bank exposure data.

Periods of high (low) real interest rates are associated to economic contractions (expansions) (Neumeyer and Perri (2005), Uribe and Yue (2006) and Akinci (2013)). In the presence of financial frictions, variations in real interest rates, and the ensuing capital flows, are also believed to affect the allocation of capital and labor across firms and sectors, and therefore aggregate productivity (Reis, 2013; Gopinath et al., 2017; Castillo-Martinez, 2020). In this paper, we study the effects of variations in real interest rates on aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) and the real exchange rate in ==== emerging market (EMEs) and advanced small open economies (AEs).====Our analysis relates to three sets of issues. First, the recent heated debate on the effects of especially low interest rates in the AEs on capital flow in emerging markets (Rey, 2013; Passari and Rey, 2015; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015). Second, the effect, since the onset of the euro area, of lower real interest rates on capital inflows in the euro area periphery (Reis, 2013; Gopinath et al., 2017; Castillo-Martinez, 2020; Siena, 2021). Those inflows have been associated with current account imbalances, loss of competitiveness, and a slowdown in aggregate productivity. The dismal performance of productivity in the euro area periphery in the first decade of the 2000s, in particular, has ignited a wider debate on the alleged “misallocation effects” of capital (in)flows. Third, the role of real interest rate fluctuations for EMEs business cycles (Neumeyer and Perri, 2005; Uribe and Yue, 2006; Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007). Noticeably, the latter empirical literature has generally not focused on the ==== effect on total factor productivity of variations in real interest rates, usually treating real interest rates and productivity as co-moving exogenous processes.====Using a structural vector auto regression (VAR) analysis we document a striking difference between EMEs and AEs. Conditional on identified real interest rate shocks, aggregate productivity moves in opposite directions in EMEs and in AEs. An unexpected rise in the real interest rate causes (on average) a ==== in productivity in EMEs, while the opposite holds for AEs countries (i.e., a positive real interest rate shock causes a ==== in productivity). This result holds independently of the measure of the real interest rate and of using a factor-utilization adjusted or a simple measure of aggregate TFP.====In all cases aggregate TFP responds pro-cyclically to real interest rate shocks (i.e., productivity is conditionally positively correlated to GDP), yet GDP responds positively to a positive real interest rate shock in AEs whereas it responds negatively in EMEs. In EMEs, a rise in the real interest rate causes a depreciation of the real exchange rate while in all countries it improves the trade balance, consistent with the view that a positive real interest rate shock proxies a capital outflow.====A noticeable implication of our results is that the alleged “misallocation narrative” of capital flows - whereby capital inflows associated with lower real interest rates lead to a slowdown in aggregate TFP - seems to describe well only the experience of the AEs, and especially of the euro area periphery countries since the onset of the euro, as, e.g., in Gopinath et al. (2017)). But the same narrative is clearly at odds with our observed evidence for EMEs: in EMEs lower real interest rates and capital inflows lead to a pro-cyclical rise in aggregate TFP.",Real interest rates and productivity in small open economies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000326,20 February 2023,2023,Research Article,20.0

The volatility of gross inflows has been largely absorbed through offsetting capital outflows which capture the purchase of foreign assets by EM residents. In other words, when foreign investors increase their holdings of EMs' assets, EM residents accumulate foreign assets and vice versa. To further smooth the domestic impact of fluctuations in capital inflows, EMs also employ several capital flow management policies such as capital controls or foreign exchange interventions.==== Fig. 1 shows, for example, that the public sector actively leans against fluctuations in capital inflows by accumulating official reserves when gross inflows increase and selling reserves when inflows recede.====The chart also shows the evolution of the stock market's total-return index in EMs, expressed in deviation from trend. We see that in the years prior to the global financial crisis, stock prices in EMs rose rapidly above trend exactly when foreign investors increased their holdings of EM assets while EM residents brought their money abroad. The opposite dynamic took place post 2007 when EM stock prices plunged while gross capital flows declined sharply. This suggests that EM residents seize a trading advantage by buffering the volatility of gross capital inflows with gross outflows: they sell EM assets when prices are high and buy them back when prices decline.====This paper proposes a model that accounts for these facts and leads to novel normative implications for capital flow management. Our model features a three-period open economy representing an EM that is populated by a large number of private agents. In the first period, these agents issue long-term debt to foreign investors to finance an illiquid domestic investment and to accumulate liquid foreign assets. In the second period, there is a risk of an external financial tightening, whereby foreign investors withdraw their funds, leading to a fire sale of the outstanding stock of EM debt. More specifically, external financial tightening takes the form of deleveraging by foreign banks, in line with the evidence about the role of banking in the transmission of the global financial cycle (Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2020). When external financial conditions tighten, home agents as well as foreign arbitrageurs use their liquidity to buy home debt. External financial tightening thus leads to a “retrenchment” (as defined by Forbes and Warnock, 2012) in which home agents repatriate foreign funds at the same time as foreigners sell home assets. In a decentralized equilibrium, home agents hold a level of liquidity such that the expected benefit from buying back domestic debt at the fire-sale price is exactly offset by the opportunity cost of carrying the liquidity.====The model explains why the private sector of an open economy tends to build a large external balance sheet in which a large share of gross capital inflows is channeled into the purchase of liquid foreign assets rather than towards domestic physical investment. This might look like a diversion of capital flows away from their most productive use but the country's large external balance sheet in fact helps it to finance more investment at home. External liquidity reduces the country's cost of external borrowing and stimulates domestic productive investment.====It is in the normative area that our model has the most novel implications. The conventional wisdom and the existing literature hold that EMs should use policies to make capital flows less volatile. An example of such policies is the countercyclical tax on capital inflows used by Brazil in 2009–14 to mitigate capital inflow pressure. These views have been highly influential in policy circles, for example reshaping the IMF policy framework that now grants countries the ability of “pre-emptively curbing debt inflows to safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability” (Adrian et al., 2022). There are debates about the best instruments to achieve that goal but policymakers seem to have little doubt that the goal of capital flow management is to curb capital flow volatility.====Our model has the opposite implication. We find that a social planner maximizes the welfare of the small open economy by ====, not reducing, the size and volatility of gross capital flows. As explained above, gross capital flow volatility is part of a process that reduces the volatility in home asset prices and thus the risk premia that they bear. The problem that the social planner has to solve is that the private sector under-invests in foreign liquidity because of a pecuniary externality. Private agents do not internalize the impact of their decisions on the price of domestic debt. Internalizing this externality means increasing the size and volatility of gross capital inflows and outflows.====The model also offers a novel interpretation of the role of foreign exchange intervention (FXI). Whereas the existing literature has focused on the impact of FXI on exchange rates, our model highlights its effect on domestic asset price volatility and risk premia.==== We interpret FXI as the government using its own balance sheet to amplify the gross capital flows generated by the private sector. FXI has no impact in economies with a high level of financial development because of Ricardian equivalence but may benefit countries with an intermediate level of financial development. Furthermore, we show that in these countries FXI may have larger welfare benefits than capital controls.====At a positive level, our model can explain why capital flows behave differently in advanced economies, emerging markets and low-income countries. Fig. 2 compares the behavior of capital flows across countries with different levels of international financial integration. The sample of countries includes 104 countries across low-income countries, emerging markets, and advanced economies (AEs).==== In the figure the countries are allocated to quartiles by increasing levels of international financial integration, as measured by the sum of foreign assets and liabilities in percent of GDP.====The left-hand side panel of Fig. 2 shows that gross capital inflows are markedly more volatile in the most financially integrated countries. This fact is not surprising but it goes to show that AEs (which are predominantly in the top quartile) are not immune to capital flow volatility. There is a paradox (explained by our model) in the fact that capital flow management policies are being recommended to EMs, not AEs, even though the shocks that these policies are meant to smooth seem to be much larger for the latter than the former. What makes EMs special is not that they are hit by larger shocks but that they are less resilient than AEs to these shocks.====The middle panel gives a hint as to why this is the case. The chart shows the fraction of gross capital inflows that are offset by capital outflows, as measured by country regressions of outflows over inflows. We see that in more financially developed countries, fluctuations in capital inflows are offset by opposite movements in outflows to a much larger degree. Importantly, this is not because more financially developed countries use more FXI. As shown in the third panel, FXI is used predominantly by countries at intermediate levels of international financial integration.====This set of facts is easy to interpret through the lens of the model. The model predicts that in more financially integrated countries the private sector uses its external balance sheet to smooth external financial shocks. In those countries, capital flow management policies tend to be less effective as well as less necessary because the private sector does a good job at offsetting the volatility of capital inflows, as shown by the middle panel of Fig. 2. Hence countries with high levels of financial integration have little incentive to use capital flow management policies. By contrast, in countries at lower levels of financial development and integration, capital flow management policies are both more effective and more beneficial as the private sector is constrained by the smaller size of its balance sheet.==== As described in the model, those countries tend to use FXI rather than capital controls because the former has larger welfare gains.==== Our paper is related to the literature that studies the behavior of gross capital flows in the global financial cycle. Broner et al. (2013) document that gross capital flows are much more volatile than net flows and are highly correlated. This correlation has increased over time in line with the process of global financial integration, as described in Davis and van Wincoop (2018). Consistent with the predictions of our model, IMF (2013) finds that EM economies that exhibit stronger comovement between gross flows tend to be more resilient against fluctuations in global capital markets. Also consistent with our model is the fact that fluctuations in gross capital flows are primarily driven by global factors (Forbes and Warnock, 2012) and are shaped by the behavior of global banks (Forbes and Warnock, 2012; Bruno and Shin, 2015; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2020; Avdjiev et al., 2022).====There is less literature explaining the comovements between gross inflows and gross outflows from a theoretical standpoint. Aguiar and Amador (2011) attribute this comovement to the fact that foreign assets constitute a collateral for a country's foreign liabilities. Davis and van Wincoop (2018) present a two-period portfolio model in which gross inflows and outflows are positively correlated in response to shocks in the cost of international portfolio diversification. In a contribution that is more closely related to ours and is discussed in more detail below, Caballero and Simsek (2020) present a model of gross capital flows in which capital flow surges and retrenchments are generated by fickle global investors.====Our contribution is normative more than positive. As noted earlier, most of the theoretical literature on capital flow management has focused on controls on capital inflows—see for example Ostry et al. (2012) and Korinek (2011). The rationale for policy intervention generally arises from pecuniary externalities associated with collateral constraints, as analyzed for example in Jeanne and Korinek (2010), Bianchi (2011), Benigno et al. (2016), Korinek and Sandri (2016), Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2017), and Korinek (2018). In these models, there is no meaningful separate role for the management of inflows and outflows.==== What matters in a crisis is the net worth of indebted agents and it is irrelevant if net worth is increased by lowering external debt or increasing external assets. These papers have shown that controls on capital inflows should be used to reduce net capital inflows. The pecuniary externality at work in our model is different from that literature since it is distributive rather than collateral-based, to use the terminology in Davila and Korinek (2018).====Our analysis shares several features with Caballero and Simsek (2020), in particular the association of capital flow retrenchments with fire sales. But there are also key differences. Caballero and Simsek assume that gross inflows are used exclusively to finance domestic investment. When capital inflows dry up, the country is forced to liquidate domestic capital at fire sale prices. This provides an incentive for a domestic social planner to restrict rather than expand gross inflows. In our model, gross inflows can instead be re-channeled abroad via the accumulation of liquid reserves. A second difference is that Caballero and Simsek emphasize the role of gross inflows in creating liquidity for the rest of the world whereas our analysis focuses on a small open economy.====The paper is also related to a theoretical literature on reserves accumulation and the role of foreign exchange intervention. Jeanne and Rancière (2011) present a model of the optimal level of reserves to deal with rollover risk in external debt. Reserves are modeled as an insurance contract that pays off conditional on the realization of a sudden stop, like in Caballero and Panageas (2008). Bianchi et al. (2018) analyze a similar problem where reserves take the form of a noncontingent asset and can be financed by sovereign defaultable debt. Gourinchas et al. (2022) present a model in which EMs hold low-yielding US assets because they yield a higher return in bad times. In these models, there is no meaningful difference between reserves held by the government or by the private sector. Similar to our paper, Céspedes et al. (2017) and Céspedes and Chang (2020) analyze models in which official reserves are needed because the private sector does not internalize the beneficial effects of liquidity in periods of financial distress. Fanelli and Straub (2021) present a model in which foreign exchange interventions help to smooth the consumption of poor domestic agents. In Benigno et al. (2022), the government accumulates reserves to depreciate the currency and tilt production towards the tradable sector because it incorporates positive growth externalities.====A related line of empirical literature has pointed to the stabilizing benefits of reserves. Bussière et al. (2015), Ghosh et al. (2016), and Aizenman et al. (2015) found that countries with higher levels of reserves were less likely to suffer a crisis or fared better in crises. Blanchard et al. (2015) show that countercyclical reserve interventions have stemmed exchange rate pressures from global capital flow shocks in emerging market economies. Closer to our paper, Avdjiev et al. (2022) show that in emerging market economies foreign exchange reserves tend to offset the volatility of gross inflows to the private sector.====The paper is structured as follows.

Mengus Eric,"HEC Paris and CEPR, Economics and Decision Sciences Department, 1 rue de la Libération, 78 350 Jouy-en-Josas, France","Received 20 May 2021, Revised 9 February 2023, Accepted 10 February 2023, Available online 16 February 2023, Version of Record 6 March 2023.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2023.103737,Cited by (0),"This paper provides a theory of endogenous implicit guarantees on risky assets, in which a government’s ==== take the form of asset purchases to alleviate asymmetric information on private liquidity needs. As a result of asymmetric information, direct transfers to agents are imperfect so that, when more constrained agents are also more exposed to a given asset, asset purchases by the government are optimal. When anticipated, this form of bailouts leads to an endogenous implicit guarantee premium so that otherwise risky assets can be traded as if there are risk-free. This possibility of implicit guarantee is amplified by other financial frictions such as risk-shifting. Finally, I show how this form of bailouts can shed light on the buildup of the euro area's sovereign debt crisis."," Implicit guarantees have been suggested as one of the major factors underlying the euro area's sovereign debt crisis, in which the periphery accumulated debts mainly purchased by core countries. Core countries' banks played a major role in this debt internationalization as they were commonly massively exposed to the periphery, either directly or indirectly. Ex post, the fear of financial contagion led Europe to implement rescue plans, in particular for Greece and Portugal, partly by purchasing their sovereign debt.====But why do implicit guarantees emerge in the first place? As put forward by Acharya and Yorulmazer (2007) and Farhi and Tirole (2012), investors can be “too many to fail” and, ex ante, the expectation of a bailout leads investors to build up exposure, leading to the expectation becoming self-fulfilling. Are asset purchases really the optimal form of government bailout? Why not directly rescue the agents exposed to the asset, for example by asking them to “show” their assets? And, to what extent can asset purchase bailouts shed lights on the euro area's debt crisis? In this paper, I study the conditions under which a benevolent government finds it optimal to rescue banks by purchasing assets and whether, when anticipated, this guarantee can become self-fulfilling, and I connect these findings to a set of stylized facts on the euro area's debt crisis.==== To study the emergence of implicit guarantee, I introduce a model (Section 2) with a government—standing for core countries' governments and the euro area's institutions—and banks—standing for core countries' financial institutions. Due to liquidity needs in the future, banks are willing to transfer wealth by either investing in safe assets—core countries' liabilities—and/or in risky assets—liabilities of the periphery. The return on risky assets depends on the aggregate state of the economy—either normal times or times of crisis. Ex post, after the realization of returns, the government may step in to compensate banks in the case of a liquidity shortage.====However, the government cannot directly observe individual portfolios and liquidity needs and banks can privately trade risky assets with each other on a private market. On the one hand, these assumptions do not prevent the government to acquire information by verifying banks' reports—the government can ask a bank to show the assets that it reports. But, on the other hand, the private market introduces the possibility of “double deviations” by banks: a bank can overstate its exposure to risky assets and, to make its report consistent, buy these assets in the private market.==== As a benchmark, I first investigate the perfect information case (Section 3). The government is able to perfectly compensate banks, whatever banks' portfolios and their decisions to trade on the private market. This perfect insurance discourages banks to transfer wealth to the future and, thus, does not allow for a guarantee to emerge on risky assets. This motivates considering the case of imperfect information, in which the government cannot directly manage private liquidity needs.==== I then study the optimal ==== compensation problem (Section 4) faced by the government under imperfect information. In this case, transfers are designed using banks' reports. To study this problem, I borrow techniques from the literature on optimal taxation with hidden trade (e.g. Werning, 2001; Golosov and Tsyvinski, 2007, among others).====I first show that the government can optimally purchase assets as a way to compensate banks and this happens when the exposures to risky assets are strictly positively correlated with the banks' liquidity needs. A critical ingredient in this result is the possibility for banks to trade on the private market: I show that this constrains transfers to be linear in the exposure to risky assets and that the government can implement such linear transfer by purchasing risky assets from banks and by collecting its payoffs. When the correlation between exposures to risky assets and liquidity needs is positive, reallocating resources towards more exposed banks justifies the cost of purchasing risky assets above their fundamental value. Otherwise, when this correlation is negative, the optimal compensation is a direct and uniform transfer to banks.==== I show (Section 5) that the mutual feedback between portfolios and bailout decisions leads to multiple equilibria.====First, a full-guarantee equilibrium may exist in which the anticipation of an asset purchase by banks leads to portfolios that make the asset purchase optimal. When banks anticipate the purchase of risky assets, risky assets become substitutes for safe assets. Banks with stronger future liquidity needs—initially poorer banks in the model—may then invest more in risky assets, leading to a positive correlation between liquidity needs and exposures to risky assets. Ex post, this positive correlation pushes the government to purchase risky assets above their fundamental value in times of crisis, thus confirming the initial anticipation of banks.====Second, a partial-guarantee equilibrium exists in which the government implements direct and uniform transfers. In this equilibrium, markets perceive risky assets as being risky and, under decreasing absolute risk aversion, richer banks invest more in risky assets. The resulting negative correlation between liquidity needs and exposures leads the government not to purchase risky assets ex post. Yet, this does not prevent the government to implement direct transfers to banks, even though these transfers are imperfect, providing only a partial guarantee.====But, which kind of equilibrium is desirable for the government? I show that the full-guarantee equilibrium is inefficient: if it has the ability to do so, the government generally commits not to implement asset purchases. Instead, the government may prefer to implement imperfect direct transfers to banks in times of crisis, as, this leads poorer banks to invest less in risky assets as in partial guarantee equilibrium, consistently with the literature highlighting that bailouts can alleviate financial frictions (see Keister, 2016; Bianchi, 2016; Bengui et al., 2019, among others).==== I then connect these results to facts on the euro area sovereign debt crisis (Section 6). In a nutshell and consistently with the model: first, before the crisis, spreads on sovereign debts within the euro area all converged to almost 0—Greece was able to borrow at very similar rates to Germany. Second, these low spreads reflected low default expectations, despite remaining heterogeneity in fundamentals across euro area countries. Third, the core countries and, especially, their financial sectors, built up large exposures to the peripheral countries and there is suggestive evidence indicating that this was made possible by bailout expectations. Fourth, during the crisis, euro area's official institutions implemented transfers that, sometimes, took the form of asset purchases.==== I then extend the model in several ways.====First, I introduce private uncertainty (Section 7.1) about the government's incentives to bail out. In this setting, I show banks speculate ex ante on the government's bailout incentives and this may lead private agents to trade risky assets with an implicit guarantee premium. Ex post, when actually observing a government bailout, banks revise their beliefs on the government's bailout incentives, potentially leading to a fall in the price of risky assets in private secondary markets in times of crisis.====Second, I consider bailouts (Section 7.2) where the government can implement multiple transfers to individual bank. I show that a full guarantee equilibrium may still exist in this setting. As with a single transfer, providing the incentives to each individual bank to reveal their resources is costly for the government and, in contrast, when the shortage of liquidity is correlated with exposures, making transfers contingent on exposures channels funds directly to more liquidity constrained banks.====Third, I investigate (Section 7.3) how additional financial frictions may contribute to the emergence of guarantees. To this end, I introduce a limited liability constraint that is known to create risk-shifting (Allen and Gale, 2000). I show that this leads more liquidity constrained agents to invest more in risky assets, thus potentially leading to a positive correlation between exposures and liquidity needs that, in turn, prompts the government to purchase risky assets.==== This paper has two implications. First, the risk priced by the market may not reflect fundamental risk due to the presence of implicit guarantees. This then casts doubts on the use of market-based risk appreciation for regulatory purposes, as, for example in Basel II or III.====Second, as my results suggest, the possibility of implicit guarantees is more likely in the case of high exposure—especially that of leveraged systemic financial institutions—to a given specific asset. In response, the government may want to avoid the build-up of such high exposure, no matter the market appreciation of risks. This may require the introduction of “sand in the wheels” to break the substitutability between potential stores of liquidity—risky and safe assets, or more generally regulation of the financial sector's exposures.==== This paper is related to the literature on collective moral hazard and, in particular, to Farhi and Tirole (2012) who study how non-targeted bailouts lead agents to correlate their leverage choices, thus leading to self-fulfilling bailout expectations.==== In contrast, in this paper, I study the conditions under which a government can improve on imperfect bailouts by making transfers contingent on the exposure to a given asset and how the expectation of such transfers affects portfolio decisions and the pricing of asset risk.====This paper is also connected to Tirole (2012), Philippon and Skreta (2012) and Bhattacharya and Nyborg (2013) among others,==== who also study optimal government interventions in asset markets. In contrast with these papers, I do not consider a situation where the government faces uncertainty on the quality of the asset, but uses asset exposures to alleviate adverse selection on the private sector's liquidity needs. Also, in this paper, banks are net sellers of risky assets, which makes asset purchases always desirable from the point of view of banks, thus contrasting with Amador and Bianchi (2021), in which asset purchases may be detrimental in fundamentals-driven crises where remaining banks are net buyers of assets.====From this perspective, this paper is also connected to the public finance literature on taxation with hidden trades (see Werning, 2001; Golosov and Tsyvinski, 2007; Farhi et al., 2009, among others). As in this literature, banks may “double-deviate” by both misreporting portfolios and anonymously trading on private markets and, as in Golosov and Tsyvinski (2007), the price on the private market which impacts the value of such double deviations is endogenously determined.====This paper is also related to the literature on the internal costs of sovereign defaults (e.g. Guembel and Sussman, 2009; Broner et al., 2010; Gennaioli et al., 2014; Mengus, 2015, Mengus, 2018). In particular, the link between government bailout decisions and the possibility to trade on a private market is connected to Broner et al. (2010). In their case, the secondary market helps to reallocate debt from external to domestic creditors and the resulting domestic holdings incentivize the government to enforce debt payment to ensure risk-sharing across domestic agents. In my case, secondary markets do not modify the equilibrium under perfect information but play a role under imperfect information for banks to misreport their portfolios and force the government to imperfect bailouts. In Mengus (2018), I considered the alternative for a sovereign between repaying its debt on the one hand and on the other defaulting and implementing transfers. As asset purchases in this paper, sovereign repayment helps to alleviate asymmetric information. However, this paper differs in several dimension. First, it is more general as this paper is about any form of asset purchases/reimbursement. Second, this paper obtains asset purchases as the outcome of economic frictions (e.g., unobservable trades by banks), and not by assumption. Third, this paper shows the self-fulfilling nature of bailouts, with asset purchase and direct transfers bailouts leading to different but each time self-confirming portfolio decisions. Fourth, asset purchase bailouts, in contrast to sovereign repayment, are not desirable ex ante, even though direct transfers are ex ante desirable in this paper's setting.====Lastly, this paper is connected to the literature on the trading of otherwise worthless assets at positive prices (see Samuelson, 1958; Diamond, 1965; Tirole, 1985, among others). In this paper, I introduce a novel mechanism whereby endogenous guarantees give additional value to assets, even over a finite horizon, thus providing a micro-foundation to guarantees that have been shown to be important in the trading of fiat assets (e.g. Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1983). From this perspective, this paper is connected to the literature on public providing of liquidity as investigated by Holmstrom and Tirole (1998) and Gorton and Huang (2004) among others, as government's bailouts are providing liquidity, when the market cannot.",Asset purchase bailouts and endogenous implicit guarantees,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000235,16 February 2023,2023,Research Article,22.0

This process of ==== is uneven over time, exhibiting more volatility early than later in the life cycle of exporters. Specifically, young exporters are particularly likely to exit, and if they keep exporting, to expand at the intensive and sub-extensive margins, doing so by widening product scope within a destination before entering new destinations. We also find that firms' core products are particularly resilient despite being used to “test the waters” when entering additional countries. Existing models of firm export dynamics are not designed to explain these empirical regularities. We argue that they can be rationalized by a mechanism where new exporters are uncertain about the profitability of their products in different markets, but learn from their initial export experiences and then adjust their sales, number of products and destination countries accordingly.","How do firms enter and expand within and across foreign markets? In an insightful recent survey of the literature on firm dynamics, Alessandria et al. (2021a, p. 35) conclude that “despite the careful modeling of entry costs, the literature has largely avoided the treatment of a firm's dynamic decisions across multiple destinations. […] Answers to key questions […], such as the effects of bilateral trade wars, may be critically affected by the exact nature of trade costs across destinations and the opportunities for market switching.” In this paper, we uncover novel facts about how firms export multiple products across different foreign markets. We show that firm export dynamics involves expansion, as well as contraction, at different (sub-)extensive margins. Over time, some firms reach new destinations and add products to current and new destinations. Meanwhile, others discontinue products, abandon countries, and sometimes quit exporting altogether. Interestingly, this process is much more pronounced for young exporters.====Exploiting data on all French exporters between 1993 and 2006, we start by documenting that, in line with previous research, exporters exhibit significant entry and exit in foreign markets as well as churning of products sold abroad, and that new exporters typically start small in volume, reaching a single market with a single product. Many quickly give up exporting. Conversely, the majority of those that keep serving foreign markets swiftly expand along all these dimensions: total volume, number of products sold abroad, and number of countries served. Moreover, branching out through new products and new countries often follows a sequential pattern, in which most of the expansion that happens early in a firm's export tenure is by adding products instead of countries.====These findings suggest a specific pattern of age dependence whereby there is more volatility in exporters' early years than later. There could be many reasons behind this pattern. We therefore carry out a detailed empirical analysis to scrutinize and refine it. Our methodology extends the approach of Albornoz et al. (2012) to the product dimension, where we compare the dynamics after a firm's first-ever export spell and after subsequent spells with old and new products in old and new destinations. To do so, we define categorical variables for the first year of a spell, the first product sold and the first country served by each firm. Using these variables, as well as double and triple interaction terms, we tease out age dependence in exporters' growth, exit, and entry behavior.====The results broadly confirm the stylized facts mentioned above. Growth in the second year of the first-ever spell is between 11 and 25 percentage points higher than growth after the second year of other spells with either the same product or country. Young exporters are also substantially more likely to expand scope in their first destination, and to take their first product to other destinations, than experienced exporters, although this last difference is smaller than the previous one. Furthermore, immediate exit is 15 percentage points more likely after an exporter's first-ever export spell than after a later spell with a different product in a different country, and the triple-interaction coefficient shows differential exit in firms' first market and first product of about 6 percentage points.====We show that these novel empirical findings are not driven by firm size or by changes in firms' productivities? They apply both to firms that start exporting very small (the large majority) and to firms that start exporting multiple products to multiple countries, or that are part of a multinational company. They remain valid when we allow for learning from export “pioneers” and when we control for firms' financial constraints. They are also robust to partial-year effect corrections, to different definitions of experienced exporters, and to controlling for a wide set of fixed effects.====This uneven “internationalization path” is difficult to reconcile with standard models of firm export dynamics. In particular, they are inconsistent with the “canonical model of export dynamics,” as defined by Alessandria et al. (2021a), where firms enter foreign markets in response to productivity shocks, after incurring sunk entry costs. Other mechanisms developed in recent papers could help to explain some of our empirical results, but as we discuss in Section 4.2.3, they were not designed to accommodate the dynamics of multi-product firms in multiple destinations.====We discuss one such mechanism in Section 4.2.4, which we develop in detail in the theoretical Online Appendix B (all online appendices are available at ====). It extends the model developed by Albornoz et al. (2012) to incorporate the product dimension. The key assumption is that, upon entry, firms operating a flexible manufacturing technology infer information about their ability to successfully export their core and non-core products in their first foreign destination as well as in other potential destinations. Firms incur fixed costs both to start selling to new countries and to expand/adapt their product scope within destinations. When export profitability is persistent over time and correlated across countries and products, uncertainty and fixed costs create destination and product scope option values for forward-looking firms, which then optimally engage in sequential product-and-destination exporting. Since uncertainty is highest for new exporters, first-ever export spells are characterized by high initial failure rates. Yet as firms learn their export profitability, if they decide to keep exporting, they tend to expand along all margins, increasing sales of their initial products in their initial destinations, adding products in their initial destinations, and entering new destinations with new and old products. The precise path dependence depends on the relative fixed costs of adding products vs. adding destinations.====After reviewing the literature in the next subsection, the rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we document new facts about age-dependence in exporter dynamics at the extensive and sub-extensive margins. In Section 3, we carry out a similar exercise at the intensive margin. In Section 4, we report a series of robustness checks and discuss the interpretation of our results in light of the literature.

We identify causal effects by leveraging the heterogeneity in the size distribution of bilateral cross-border bank lending to construct granular ==== for aggregate cross-border bank lending to 22 EMEs. Cross-border bank credit causes higher domestic activity in EMEs and looser financial conditions. Financial condition indices ease, nominal and real effective exchange rates appreciate, sovereign and corporate spreads narrow, domestic ==== fall, and housing prices increase. Similarly, real domestic credit grows, real GDP expands, and imports rise. Using a simple model, we motivate our instrument and show how commonly used instruments that correlate with global financial conditions (e.g. the global financial cycle) can yield biased estimates. We find empirical evidence of an amplification bias, which is consistent with the prominent role of global risk perceptions and international risk ====.","What are the effects of capital inflows on the macro-financial conditions of emerging market economies (EMEs)? International bank lending, and capital inflows more broadly, are typically seen as expansionary as they ease domestic financial conditions and boost credit and domestic demand (Blanchard et al., 2016). At the same time, higher asset valuations and stretched balance sheets could increase an economy's vulnerability to boom-bust cycles as capital flows to EMEs ebb (Reinhart et al., 2016). That is the worry of policy-makers, as they consider capital flow management and macroprudential policies to smooth the effects of capital inflows. While the decision to resort to these measures must be rooted in convincing estimates, a clearly identified causal effect of capital inflows on domestic macro-financial conditions has been notoriously difficult to pin down.====Identifying the effects of capital inflows in aggregate macro data is challenging. First, capital flows are endogenous to the current and future prospects of recipient countries. Improved domestic economic prospects will induce foreign lending, which in turn will affect domestic real and financial economic outcomes. Second, other confounding factors associated with global financial conditions and risk appetite may influence capital flows to EMEs and their economies directly. Capital flows are sensitive to risk perceptions associated with global financial cycles and US monetary policy (Kalemli-Özcan, 2020). This implies that instruments that correlate with global financial conditions are likely to deliver biased estimates of the effects of capital flows.====In this paper we propose an identification strategy to overcome the shortcomings of traditional approaches and estimate the causal effect of capital flows on EMEs. More specifically, we construct granular instrumental variables (GIVs, Gabaix and Koijen (2019)) for ==== international bank lending (a key component of capital flows) using ==== lending data to estimate the causal effects of these flows on key financial and real variables. Using a simple open economy model, we motivate our GIVs and show that traditional strategies that rely on exogenous variation in the global financial cycle do not yield valid instruments. We extend our GIV to a more general empirical model and apply it to a unique panel of bilateral country-level cross-border bank lending data for a representative sample of EMEs. We find that (i) international bank lending boosts EMEs' domestic activity and loosens financial conditions, and (ii) alternative instruments used in the literature are strongly correlated with the global financial cycle (unlike our GIVs) and lead to estimated effects an order of magnitude larger.====We begin by presenting a stylized version of the Mundell-Fleming-Dornbusch model to contrast our GIVs with alternative approaches.==== As exogenous capital flow shocks are unobserved, the international finance literature commonly estimates their effects through exogenous variation from the global financial cycle by using, for instance, U.S. monetary policy shocks. We show that, when there is no perfect capital mobility (e.g., Itskhoki and Mukhin, 2021; Maggiori, 2022), variables related to global financial conditions will yield biased estimates of the causal effect of international bank lending. These variables may not respond directly to a recipient EME's macroeconomic conditions, but they likely affect the EME through other channels.==== Focusing on the link between capital flows and the EME's output and exchange rate, we discuss in particular two biases. An attenuation bias can arise from a disproportionate effect on the exchange rate when there are no financial spillovers on domestic absorption, but foreign output is negatively affected by foreign (e.g., U.S.) interest rates, and net exports depend positively on foreign output. An amplification bias can arise from the direct effect of foreign rates on domestic output through large domestic financial spillovers and uncovered interest parity (UIP) differentials. Which bias dominates will depend on the economy's structure.====Using the model, we show that it is possible to construct granular instruments that are free from such biases by leveraging the cross-sectional size heterogeneity in the sources of lending to a given EME. Intuitively, the GIV approach requires a large cross-sectional dataset of country-level lending to any given EME, where some lending countries play a larger role than others. The idiosyncratic shocks to those countries' lending – over and above average fluctuations common to all lenders – can be used to construct a valid instrument.====We draw on a confidential dataset of bilateral country-level international bank lending data from the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) locational banking statistics. The data we use capture lending from banks resident in all BIS reporting countries to bank and non-bank borrowers resident in 22 EMEs, covering around 76% of global EME GDP on average in our sample (1990Q1-2018Q4). The size distribution of international bilateral bank claims is heterogeneous and concentrated (Aldasoro and Ehlers, 2019), making these data particularly well-suited to construct GIVs. Furthermore, international bank lending is appealing as a way to capture capital flows for at least two important reasons. First, it accounts for a significant share of capital flows, as emphasized by the growing literature on the role of global banks in transmitting financial conditions across borders.==== Second, international bank lending tends to be the marginal source of funding during credit booms, growing faster than domestic credit (Borio et al., 2011; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2019).====Our empirical strategy builds on a general reduced form model that goes beyond the simple mechanisms of the Mundell-Fleming-Dornbusch framework and allows for a richer structure. In particular, it allows for pull and push factors that can explain international bank lending (and capital flows more broadly) and domestic macro-financial variables simultaneously and controls for potential aggregate factors that affect capital flows. The variation we use comes from idiosyncratic bilateral shifters rather than those aggregate factors. Using this variation, we can identify the macro-elasticity of domestic macro-financial variables with respect to capital flows in a setting with both many outcomes of interest and potential sources of endogeneity.====The goal of our empirical strategy is to construct instrumental variables for aggregate international bank lending using bilateral lending data. We start by recovering idiosyncratic shocks to bilateral lending relationships using non-parametric methods to remove common factors among all bilateral claims to each EME. We use these shocks weighted by the heterogeneous bilateral lending shares to construct a valid and optimal instrument for aggregate lending. After obtaining the GIVs, the methodology boils down to a standard two-stage least squares approach. We use the GIVs to assess the dynamic causal effect of shocks to aggregate international bank lending on EMEs' domestic macro-financial variables, using local projections with instrumental variables (Jordà, 2005).====Our identification strategy relies on the exclusion restriction that idiosyncratic shocks to bilateral bank lending affect each EME only through international bank lending. We argue that the common component of bilateral bank lending captures both the recipient EME's macroeconomic conditions, as well as international conditions related to the global financial cycle. As a result, the remaining idiosyncratic shocks to each of the bilateral lending relationships to a particular EME are exogenous to that EME's macroeconomic outcomes. Moreover, the shocks are likely to affect the EME's conditions exclusively through bank lending, and not through other confounding factors.====The GIVs we construct are orthogonal to indicators of the global financial cycle.==== The fit of regressions of our GIVs on these indicators is virtually indistinguishable from zero and the point estimate for each global financial cycle indicator is very small and not statistically significant. We document that international bank lending is linked with measures of the global financial cycle, in line with the literature (Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015, Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2021; Bruno and Shin, 2015a, Bruno and Shin, 2015b).====We find significant causal effects of international bank lending on EME's domestic macro-financial conditions. In particular, such lending boosts EMEs' domestic activity and loosens financial conditions, in line with the literature emphasizing the financial channel of exchange rate appreciation through firms' balance sheet constraints (Bruno and Shin, 2015a, Bruno and Shin, 2015b) that tends to be more pronounced for EMEs (Banerjee et al., 2020). A positive shock to international bank lending growth causes EMEs' financial condition indices to ease, nominal and real effective exchange rates to appreciate, sovereign and corporate spreads to narrow, domestic interest rates to fall, and housing prices to increase. On the real side, the shock has a positive causal effect on real domestic credit growth, and on real gross domestic product, mostly through investment. Our baseline results are robust to extensive checks regarding the role of crises, the sample of lending countries, and the method used to construct the GIVs.====Our GIVs improve upon other instruments used in the literature. We show that, when used to instrument international banking claims, these alternative instruments: (i) are either not relevant as their first stage statistics are poor; or (ii) very likely reflect the global financial cycle and thus are not excludable. In particular, we consider the excess bond premium measure of Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) as used by Zeev (2019), the leverage of the US broker-dealer sector as in Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2018), a Bartik-type instrument inspired by the measure used in Blanchard et al. (2016), and the “host” and “common” components of aggregate cross-border lending growth as identified in Avdjiev et al. (2020) based on the methodology of Amiti and Weinstein (2018).==== The only instruments that are relevant in first stage regressions are the common component of Avdjiev et al. (2020), the leverage of the US broker-dealer sector, and the instrument based on Blanchard et al. (2016). However, they are strongly correlated with different measures of the global financial cycle, making them non-excludable. We show that using these instruments generates large upward biases in the estimation of the causal effect of international banking lending on domestic EME macro-financial conditions. This is consistent with a prominent role for fluctuations in global risk perceptions and international risk spillovers, as highlighted in Kalemli-Özcan (2020).==== Our paper contributes to the literature along several dimensions. First, we directly estimate a macro-causal effect of capital (banking) flows on EMEs. Previous studies (Calvo and Reinhart, 2000; Calvo et al., 1996; Reinhart and Reinhart, 2009) have shown that capital flows correlate with boom-bust cycles. We contribute to this literature by providing an identification strategy for the causal macroeconomic impact of international bank lending.====Second, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first application of the GIV approach to international bank lending and capital flows. International banking data such as the locational banking statistics of the BIS are a natural candidate for this approach. Recent applications of the method include Galaasen et al. (2019), which estimates the effect of firm level shocks on the banks that lend to these firms, or Camanho et al. (2019), which estimates the elasticity of supply of foreign exchange and quantifies the effect of portfolio rebalancing on the exchange rate. di Giovanni et al. (2018) uses detailed firm-level data for French firms to document that large firms are the key channel through which foreign shocks are transmitted domestically.====Third, we extend the GIV method to a non-linear panel setting and adapt the local projection approach to estimate the dynamic effects of bank lending shocks on EME macroeconomic and financial outcomes. Gabaix and Koijen (2019) introduce this methodology and only use it to achieve identification in static frameworks. We develop a dynamic framework for the evolution of the growth rate of international bank lending and domestic macroeconomic variables and show how to use GIV in this setting.====A number of recent studies leverage bilateral international banking data. Related to our paper, Amiti et al. (2019) and Avdjiev et al. (2020) provide a decomposition of aggregate growth rates of international bank claims using the BIS consolidated and locational banking statistics respectively. We focus on the country/geographical perimeter and use the BIS locational banking statistics, which align with national accounting and balance-of-payments accounting conventions and therefore are a better fit to assess the impact of cross border lending on EMEs' domestic macro-financial variables. We compare our GIVs with the decomposition in Avdjiev et al. (2020) and use it to further validate our identification strategy in an Appendix.====Several related papers study the transmission of international credit supply shocks and show they have expansionary effects in EMEs.==== Our approach differs from these papers by extracting not only the potential domestic confounding factors, but also foreign shocks that might be related to domestic variables through, for example, global growth expectations. We further contribute by showing how identification strategies that rely on instruments that correlate with the global financial cycle will deliver estimates that capture effects above and beyond the causal effect of international bank lending.==== Section 2 motivates our identification strategy (including the intuition for our instrument) by presenting a stylized small open economy model. Section 3 details the empirical strategy and the estimation approach. Section 4 describes the data, with an emphasis on that used for construction of the GIVs. Section 5 presents and discusses the baseline results, the validity of our GIVs, and several robustness checks. Section 6 compares the GIVs with other instruments from the literature. Finally, Section 7 concludes. In addition to section-specific appendices, we also provide two stand-alone appendices. The first one extends the approach to investigate the non-linear effects of international bank lending in presence of capital controls. The second one contrasts our instruments with international bank lending growth decompositions in the spirit of Amiti and Weinstein (2018).",The macro-financial effects of international bank lending on emerging markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000193,9 February 2023,2023,Research Article,24.0

We find that unanticipated shocks to foreign reserve accumulation and ","Managing the state of liquidity in the financial sector has been at the forefront of the policy responses to the 2008–2009 financial crisis. During and after the crisis, major Central Banks engaged in quantitative easing (QE) policies of an unprecedented scale. Between mid 2009 and mid 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve purchased more than $1000 billion of medium to long term US Treasury securities. At the same time, in conjunction with the QE induced abundance of liquidity, emerging market countries accumulated foreign currency reserves. Indicatively, Mexico increased its international reserves to GDP ratio by 2.4% in 2008–2009, reaching 11.9% in 2011. Brazil's ratio increased from 11.4% to 15.1% during 2008–2011, while Chile increased its ratio by 4.2% in 2008, reaching 15.7% in 2011.====There is of course considerable heterogeneity of liquidity risk across financial institutions, where this risk is defined as the probability that they suffer a large enough shock such that they are unable to meet their liabilities in a timely manner. This risk depends on individual strategic decisions as well as market and macroeconomic conditions which are exogenous to each institution.====While policy makers can possess information on the aggregate component of liquidity risk, and react to developments in the economy that are related to it, the idiosyncratic risk component is highly latent as financial institutions have private information about their own exposure in the near future.==== Moreover, financial institutions condition on public information to form beliefs about the distribution of risk in their market, which opens up the possibility of asymmetric information between policy makers and market participants. From an econometric perspective, the consequence is that learning about this distribution inevitably requires combining economic theory and data at the micro and macro level.====This paper develops and applies a structured approach in order to construct an estimate of the distribution of liquidity risk as expected by financial market participants and, additionally, to investigate whether Central Bank policies such as reserve accumulation and monetary policy convey information about its aggregate component. The latter is important as financial market perceptions about aggregate risk can potentially influence the decision of banks to expand lending and invest in riskier projects.==== If policy makers can influence these perceptions, then this provides an ==== channel through which policy can affect the economy.====In our study we analyze auction data from open market operations for domestic bonds issued by the Chilean Central Bank during 2002–2012. Since financial institutions have little incentives to reveal their individual risk exposure, we use their bids in these auctions in order to uncover it by exploiting the structure imposed by a theoretical model that closely reflects the auctions' features. A bank participating in such an auction will adjust both the quantity of bonds it wishes to buy and the interest rate it wishes to receive, according to the state of liquidity it expects to have until the bonds mature.====The case of Chile is a natural choice for studying liquidity risk and providing empirical evidence on the effects of policy, as it is one of the aforementioned countries that has historically used reserve accumulation, for precautionary and other reasons (Cabezas and Gregorio, 2019). In addition, since the 1990's Chile has adopted inflation targeting, and a standard practice to achieve the desired interest rate is issuing domestic bonds of different maturities through open market operations. Open market operations can be tightly connected to foreign reserve accumulation in practice, as they drain liquidity from the market to achieve the interest rate target; on the other hand, buying foreign currency is part of the reason why there is excess liquidity in the financial system.====The paper makes several contributions. We build on the empirical literature on the intersection of finance and industrial organization (Kastl, 2017) by showing that identifying liquidity risk requires taking into account both market microstructure and the degree of privately and publicly provided insurance against this risk. While the non-competitive structure of financial markets is something that has been shown to matter in different settings e.g. in the primary market for liquidity provision by Central Banks (Cassola et al., 2013), we study its implications for learning about liquidity risk from bidding behavior of banks in liquidity ==== auctions, where banks (and other financial institutions) buy bonds from the Central Bank.====Furthermore, we show that a bank's true valuation for the bond (or equivalently, its cost of giving up liquidity) depends on the probability of obtaining liquidity insurance. This could be achieved by either selling the bond in the secondary market, or borrowing from the interbank market and the lender of last resort, which in turn depends on macroeconomic conditions and policy. In this sense, the paper makes a methodological contribution by combining individual level auction data across time with secondary market data and macroeconomic time series to identify the latent distribution of liquidity risk. This framework allows us to investigate the effects of policy on financial market perceptions of aggregate risk. Beyond its descriptive usefulness, in the Appendix we also show how this distribution can be used to calibrate funding risk in structural macroeconomic models with banking sectors.====The paper's empirical results contribute to the strand of the empirical macroeconomic literature that studies asymmetric information between policy makers and the private sector. More particularly, we find evidence of a novel ==== channel of foreign reserve policy; an increase in foreign reserves signals to private financial institutions the expectation of an aggregate liquidity shock in the next period. In addition, we do not find evidence that news about future interventions have significant effects. This could be explained by the costly nature of these interventions, as policy actions are more credible than promises. Additionally, we find that the financial sector also revises its beliefs about aggregate risk upwards after an increase in the nominal rate. Similar to reserve accumulation, this suggests that the private sector understands that a higher interest rate is meant to alleviate some of the pressure on international capital flight, signalling a higher likelihood of a liquidity shock in the near future.====The market we consider is oligopsonistic as the number of financial institutions participating in it is small and hence they can affect the market price on the margin. We show that this has implications for existing measures of liquidity risk that are based on observed market returns that do not account for market imperfections, as variation in the interest rates does not only reflect the cost of giving up liquidity, but also the strategic behavior of banks with market power. We show that had we ignored the oligopsonistic structure of the primary market of bonds, we would have largely underestimated the aforementioned effects of policy interventions. The structure imposed by the auction model is therefore important for identification and for understanding the effects of open market operations which are an integral part of the implementation of conventional and unconventional monetary policy.","Liquidity risk, market power and the informational effects of policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000181,8 February 2023,2023,Research Article,25.0

Euro area investors are significant participants in emerging bond markets and exhibit volatile flows, but their fickleness does not result in indiscriminate periods of surge and flight. Employing granular data, we discern important investor differentiation by currency denomination and issuer-level risk factors. First, euro area investors exhibit a home currency bias leading to both strong cross-sectional preference and more stable flows to EUR-denominated bonds over time. Second, volatile flows to USD and local-currency-denominated bonds are robustly related to global risk factors including the broad dollar. Investors differentiate among USD-denominated bonds such that flows to currency mismatched (and less creditworthy) sovereigns and corporates are more sensitive to the broad dollar. In contrast, local currency bond investors appear primarily concerned with currency rather than issuer-specific credit risk.","Academics and policymakers are increasingly concerned about the possibility of global factors inducing a boom-bust cycle on capital flows to emerging market economies (EMEs). Prominent expositions of global spillovers include the global financial cycle (Rey, 2013, Rey, 2016), the risk-taking channel of monetary policy (Bruno and Shin, 2015a; Chari et al., 2021), and the dollar risk factor (Avdjiev et al., 2019a; Krishnamurthy and Lustig, 2019; Adrian and Xie, 2020).====Historically the EMEs most vulnerable to global spillovers were those that relied on foreign currency debt and thus suffered from the financial fragility associated with currency mismatches (see e.g. Krugman, 1999; Aghion et al., 2004; Aguiar, 2005; Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2016). But over the past two decades many EMEs have reduced their reliance on foreign currency debt and are increasingly borrowing from abroad in local currency (Burger et al., 2012). Although this development may reduce mismatch risks, participation in local EME debt markets exposes investors to local currency risk factors including those emphasized in understanding UIP violations (Hassan and Zhang, 2021; Kalemli-Özcan and Varela, 2021). We analyze the investor perspective in this relatively new environment. In response to global shocks, how are investor flows differentiated based on currency denomination, credit risk, and balance sheet factors? We explore data on euro area (EA) investment in EME bonds, and in contrast to much of the US and USD-centric literature, we offer a novel analysis of the 3-dimensional currency tradeoff facing EA investors: EUR v. USD v. local EME currency.====Although there is extensive evidence that financial flows to emerging markets are sensitive to global risk shocks (see Koepke, 2019 for a survey), analysis of aggregate country-level flows is unable to determine what specific issuer-level factors are driving the fickle risk-on/off cycle. To better understand the mechanisms driving international spillovers, researchers are turning to disaggregated data (see e.g. Di Giovanni et al., 2022; Faia et al., 2022). We employ security-level data on euro area (EA) investment in EME bonds which allows disaggregation not only by currency but also by borrowing sector (as emphasized by Avdjiev et al., 2022). Ultimately, we drill all the way down to the issuer level to evaluate the importance of sovereign/firm characteristics including credit risk spreads and balance sheet proxies.====Our primary findings are as follows. First, euro area investors exhibit a home currency bias that manifests itself both as a cross-sectional preference and as stable flows to EUR-denominated bonds over time. Second, volatile flows to USD and local-currency-denominated bonds are related to global risk factors including the broad dollar. Analysis of issuer-level data reveals investor differentiation among USD-denominated bonds such that flows to currency mismatched (and less creditworthy) sovereigns and corporates are more sensitive to the broad dollar. In contrast, local currency bond investors appear primarily concerned with currency rather than issuer-specific credit risk.====The advantages of employing security-level data are highlighted by using the Covid-19 shock (2020Q1) as an illustrative example. Not surprisingly we find EA investors were net sellers of EME bonds during the Covid shock with aggregate outflows of 9.6 billion. But this headline number hides important differentiation by currency denomination and issuer-level risk characteristics. First, remarkably, in the midst of the Covid crisis EA investors purchased 7.1 billion (net) in EUR-denominated EME bonds, suggesting flows to home currency bonds benefit from flight-to-safety periods. Second, outflows in response to the Covid shock were concentrated in local-currency-denominated bonds (16.9 billion) consistent with concerns about local EME currency risks (Hofmann et al., 2020b). Finally, during the Covid shock EA investors were net purchasers of USD-denominated bonds (1.9 billion), but this total masks a remarkable contrast: EA investors ==== 4.1 billion of USD-denominated debt issued by sovereigns with large FX debt burdens while ==== 4.3 billion of USD-denominated bonds issued by corporates in tradeable sectors. During the Covid shock EA investors differentiated across issuers of USD-denominated bonds based on potential balance sheet risks from currency mismatches.====Lessons from the Covid case study motivate our empirical analysis and preview our broader empirical findings. We begin our study by providing a descriptive summary of EA investment in EME bonds. In the aggregate we find EA investors are prominent participants in EME bond markets, and for some countries EA portfolio weights approach ICAPM allocations. Contrary to the dollar dominance literature, but consistent with previous findings of a home currency bias, a security-level cross-sectional analysis of EME bond holdings reveals a strong preference for EUR-denominated bonds (Boermans and Vermeulen, 2016; Burger et al., 2018; Maggiori et al., 2020). In fact, when trying to explain the extent to which EA investors hold a particular EME bond, we show it is more important to consider the currency denomination of the bond rather than the issuing country or location of issuance.====We next turn to an investigation of how EA investors adjust their EME bond holdings over time. Strikingly, given our focus on European investors, we find the broad (trade-weighted) USD is the most robust covariate with aggregate flows to EME bonds. This result is consistent with the broad dollar acting as an indicator for global risk appetite, based on the dollar's role during flight-to-safety episodes. Turning to security-level data allows us to discern whether investors are sensitive to specific issuer-level risk factors. Our primary finding is that the fickle risk-on/off pattern is not driven by indiscriminate periods of flows and flight, but rather EA investors differentiate based on currency, balance sheet, and credit risks.====We find important differentiation by currency denomination. Flows to USD and local-currency denominated bonds are sensitive to the broad dollar but flows to EUR-denominated bonds appear largely insulated from global risk factors. Over our sample period there have been periodic outflows from bonds denominated in USD and local currency, but remarkably flows to EUR-denominated EME bonds have been positive for 34 consecutive quarters. The stability of flows to EUR-denominated bonds adds a new element to previous cross-sectional studies of home currency bias. The lack of direct currency risk and a relative clustering of investment in highly rated (creditworthy) issuers likely explains the stability of flows to EUR-denominated bonds.====In sharp contrast to EUR-denominated bonds, currency risk is of first order importance for investment in local-currency-denominated bonds. Consistent with the literature's finding that EME currencies load heavily on global risk factors (Hassan and Zhang, 2021; Kalemli-Özcan and Varela, 2021), we find flows to local-currency EME bonds are highly sensitive to the broad dollar and VIX. Investor concerns about volatile EME currencies can be tempered by the ability of sovereigns to smooth exchange rate fluctuations (Devereux and Wu, 2022). We find some evidence that flows to local-denominated bonds issued by EMEs with large FX reserve balances are less sensitive to global risk shocks.====For USD-denominated bonds we find significant investor differentiation by balance sheet factors and general credit risk. Consistent with concerns about the impact of USD appreciation on currency mismatched borrowers, we find EA investors sell bonds issued by EME sovereigns with larger foreign currency debt burdens. In addition, we find that sovereigns and corporates with wider yield spreads experience flows that are more sensitive to fluctuations in the broad dollar.====We conclude with case studies of the Covid-19 shock (2020Q1) and recent Fed rate hikes (2022Q2). In each case we observe aggregate outflows from EME bonds but the aggregates mask significant differentiation by currency and issuer. In response to the Covid shock EA investors primarily sold local-currency denominated sovereign bonds but they also demonstrated important differentiation by issuer balance sheet risks as they sold USD-denominated bonds issued by sovereigns with large FX debt burdens while purchasing USD-denominated bonds issued by corporates in exporting sectors. In contrast to the Covid shock, outflows during the recent period of Fed rate hikes (2022Q2) were concentrated in USD-denominated bonds and once again we see evidence of differentiation by balance sheet risks. And finally, consistent with a home currency preference, we find EA investors continued their net purchases of home (Euro) currency bonds during both shock periods. The case studies highlight the importance of disaggregating flows by currency and issuer.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a descriptive view of EME bond holdings by EA investors and Section 3 presents cross-sectional analysis. Section 4 includes panel regressions of bond flows at the aggregate level while Section 5 provides issuer-currency-level analysis. Section 6 presents case studies and Section 7 concludes.","Fickle emerging market flows, stable euros, and the dollar risk factor",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000168,4 February 2023,2023,Research Article,26.0

At the same time, the central banks of these economies have accumulated large amounts of foreign exchange reserves. The fact that emerging market borrowers pay high interest rates to external investors while their central banks earn ultra-low returns on foreign reserves has sparked an intensive debate about the economic rationale behind this pattern. Accounts of policymakers suggest that central banks accumulate foreign reserves during normal times and use them to stabilize the domestic economy during crises, a view that is supported by a prominent empirical literature.==== Recent theoretical contributions show that reserve accumulation can indeed be an optimal policy to protect economies from volatile capital flows.====In this paper, we propose a complementary theory which emphasizes the role of foreign reserves in supporting the flow of trade. We build on the workhorse small open economy model of Bianchi (2011) in which households borrow internationally subject to a collateral constraint and introduce a trade financing friction as a central new feature.==== This friction imposes a stochastic cash-in-advance constraint on imports. In adverse states of the world, domestic firms lose access to international markets for short-term trade financing. During these periods, imports of intermediate inputs can only be purchased using foreign currency as means of transaction or collateral. If domestic holdings of foreign currency are insufficient to finance the desired level of inputs, trade, and output contract.====Our main finding is that private agents hold too little foreign currency relative to the socially optimal level. Scope for policy interventions arises in this class of models because private agents do not internalize the effect of their actions on the real exchange rate. As shown by Bianchi (2011), this ==== causes excessive capital flow volatility, because the real exchange rate enters the collateral constraint and hence the country's borrowing capacity. In the absence of the trade financing friction, optimal macroprudential policy reduces external borrowing relative to private choices in normal times to stabilize the real exchange rate in case of a crisis. In our setting, the social planner instead accumulates more foreign currency but borrows a similar amount compared to private agents. This achieves both, a lower level of ==== external debt and a higher level of liquid resources which can be used to support trade in a crisis.====Why is reserve accumulation a more efficient policy intervention than a reduction of borrowing in our model? We show analytically that reserves are a valuable macroprudential policy tool because of their highly counter-cyclical return. While reserves yield constant and low interest, they are most useful when trade financing is unavailable. Since the collateral constraint typically binds in these periods, the effective return of reserves is particularly high when the externality is strong. By contrast, a reduction in foreign borrowing increases available resources in the future by the same amount in all states of the world.====Decentralizing the planner allocation requires that the accumulation of official reserves is complemented by capital controls in normal times. This second intervention is necessary, because private agents would otherwise respond to reserve accumulation by increasing their own borrowing. We further show that, in a severe crisis, private agents engage in inefficient liquidity hoarding. This is because they do not internalize that holding on to foreign currency further depreciates the real exchange rate. To address this inefficiency, the policymaker must limit the foreign currency holdings of private agents during periods of financial distress. The optimal policy mix in the model is hence characterized by (i) the pro-cyclical accumulation of reserves at the central bank, (ii) macroprudential capital controls, (iii) active use of reserves to support trade and (iv) the limitation of private foreign currency holdings during financial crises. Importantly, this captures many features of observed emerging market polices.====We calibrate the model to study its quantitative predictions and find that implementing optimal policies has strong stabilizing effects. By accumulating more reserves, the planner mitigates the depreciation of the real exchange rate from 22% to 10% and the fall in tradable consumption from 25% to 10% in a typical Sudden Stop episode. To evaluate the success of our model at explaining observed dynamics, we present a set of stylized facts on goods and capital flows around Sudden Stop dates. During these episodes the real exchange rate strongly depreciates and the current account reverses. At the same time, there are sharp contractions in output, imports, and exports as well as outflows of foreign reserves. Our model quantitatively replicates these stylized facts. We show that the trade financing friction is crucial for this result. Without this friction, the economy is identical to the one of Bianchi (2011). In this economy, neither private agents nor the social planner hold reserves, so their dynamics cannot be replicated. Moreover, the observed contractions in gross goods flows do not occur. This highlights the importance of trade financing frictions in understanding Sudden Stops.====Our focus on the role of foreign reserves in facilitating trade in intermediate inputs is motivated by a number of empirical facts. First, intermediate inputs to production dominate overall international trade. At least 60% of international trade is in intermediate inputs. Using OECD data, we find that the relevant number in our context is close to 85%. Second, most traded goods are not paid for in advance but financed with short-term debt with maturity below one year. According to the IMF (2009), around 40% of trade is intermediated through short-term bank loans, and another 40% is direct trade credit. Third, in times of crises, emerging market firms' ability to finance imported inputs is severely restricted and central bank interventions can be effective in supporting trade (Vaubourg, 2016; Wang and Ronci, 2006).==== Most closely related to this paper are recent contributions which jointly study reserve accumulation and emerging market crises in quantitative frameworks. The central difference of our theory to the existing literature is the role of trade and trade financing frictions. Arce et al. (2022) show that foreign reserve accumulation can be used to implement the constrained-efficient allocation in the model of Bianchi (2011) if reserves carry the same interest as foreign debt. If the return on reserves is below the interest rate at which domestic agents can borrow internationally, reserve accumulation is strictly dominated by other macroprudential policies in their model.==== We find that accumulating reserves with low returns is part of an optimal policy mix if they can support the flow of trade in a crisis. Bianchi et al. (2018) develop a quantitative model to study the optimal accumulation of foreign reserves in an economy subject to sovereign default risk. Sovereigns issue long-term debt and invest in international reserves simultaneously because they provide liquidity in states in which borrowing conditions deteriorate. Our focus lies on studying private borrowing and public reserve accumulation, which dominate gross capital flows in the data as discussed in Section 2. Other recent contributions rationalize reserve accumulation at the central bank in models where individual agents do not have access to these assets.==== In our model, reserve accumulation is part of the optimal policy mix even though private agents can insure themselves through the accumulation of foreign currency.====We further connect to a literature studying the effect of reserve accumulation on financial stability in stylized, analytical setups.==== Bocola and Lorenzoni (2020) provide a model in which foreign reserves improve the credibility of domestic policymakers to intervene in crises. Thereby, reserves lower the economy's exposure towards exchange rate risk and improve financial stability without being used in equilibrium. In contrast, reserves need to be actively used in our model which is in line with the pro-cyclical behavior of reserves in the data. The contributions of Aizenman (2011) and Acharya and Krishnamurthy (2018) show that private agents accumulate inefficiently low amounts of liquid assets in the presence of externalities, giving scope to macroprudential policy interventions. While the mechanisms behind these results are similar to the one studied here, neither of these papers shares our focus on trade or provides a quantitative evaluation of their theories.====We present our analysis in real terms and abstract from issues related to nominal prices. This might appear surprising as nominal exchange rate management is often seen as the primary use for foreign reserves. A recent literature following Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) studies nominal exchange rates and macroprudential policies in economies with a downward nominal wage rigidity. Ottonello (2021) analyzes the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of nominal rigidities and financial frictions. Bianchi and Lorenzoni (2022) show that macroprudential policies, including foreign reserve accumulation, reduce the need to depreciate the nominal (and real) exchange rate for demand stabilization.==== Analogue to these studies, our analysis could be translated to a model with nominal rigidities, where the planner uses reserve accumulation to stabilize the real and nominal exchange rate. We leave this exercise for future work.====The rest of the article proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents empirical evidence motivating our analysis. Section 3 lays out the model and characterizes the competitive equilibrium. In Section 4 we characterize the constrained-efficient allocation and discuss the inefficiencies in private choices.

Calvo et al. (2008) define a systemic sudden stop as a large current account contraction during a time of systemic financial turmoil. Calvo et al. (2006) develop a two-step procedure involving fluctuations in a country's current account balance and either the Fed Funds rate or the aggregate emerging market bond index spread (EMBI) to identify 22 emerging market systemic sudden stop events during the 1980s and 1990s. Korinek and Mendoza (2014) and later Bianchi and Mendoza (2020) expand this process and they identify a total of 51 distinct systemic sudden stop episodes from 1980 to 2016. These episodes are not evenly distributed across time since by definition they are centered around periods of systemic financial turmoil, particularly around times of Federal Reserve monetary tightening. But while these episodes tend to cluster, they are still rare, and even during these events, only a small subset of countries experience a sudden stop episode. A sudden stop is a discrete rare event that exists alongside regular business cycle fluctuations. For this reason, Mendoza (2010) models a sudden stop as happening when an occasionally binding collateral constraint starts to bind.====In this paper we build a model where a systemic sudden stop is a discrete rare event driven by an exogenous increase in the world cost of borrowing. We then model how central bank foreign exchange intervention (FXI) can be used as a tool to prevent a sudden stop and model how a central bank holds a stock of reserves as insurance against a sudden stop event.====In order to describe the characteristics of sudden stops and to rationalize the benefits of foreign exchange intervention, our model incorporates three features. First, the economy must have a borrowing constraint which is occasionally binding. A sudden stop is a rare event; most of the time the constraint is slack. Second, an increase in the cost of foreign borrowing must actually increase the probability of a binding borrowing constraint. Finally, central bank foreign exchange intervention must be effective even during normal times, when the borrowing constraint is slack.====We adopt the model of an underborrowing equilibrium from Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2021). Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe show how under certain parameter values, when external debt passes a high enough threshold, there are multiple equilibria in the external position of a small open economy. In one equilibrium, consumption and external debt remains high, sustaining a high value of the real exchange rate, and the value of collateral is high enough so that the borrowing constraint is slack. But in another equilibrium, a reduction in borrowing leads to a real depreciation, a falling value of collateral, and a binding borrowing constraint.====By our choice of equilibrium selection criterion we rule out the possibility of multiple self-fulfilling equilibria; if the fundamentals of the economy support the non-binding equilibrium then agents' beliefs will always coalesce around this equilibrium. However, we show that for a country with a high enough level of external debt, the world interest rate could rise to a point where the non-binding equilibrium is no longer supported and the borrowing constraint is violated. At that point there is a discrete collapse in external borrowing as the economy falls to the only equilibrium remaining, the one where a borrowing constraint binds with a low level of external debt and consumption. So even when we rule out the possibility of self-fulfilling changes in equilibria, the model still leads to a discontinuity in the economy's level of external borrowing when the world interest rate rises to a level where the “good” non-binding equilibrium is no longer supported.====This result is driven by a key feature in the model of the underborrowing equilibrium from Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2021) where in a non-binding equilibrium, as agents delever and the stock of external debt falls by one unit, the fall in the real exchange rate is large enough that the value of collateral falls by more than one unit. So even as agents delever, the slack in the borrowing constraint shrinks. At a high enough level of initial debt, even a small increase in the cost of foreign borrowing can eliminate this slack, and the non-binding equilibrium is no longer possible. Furthermore we show that a sudden stop triggered by an exogenous increase in the world risk free rate is a particular feature of this underborrowing equilibrium model from Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2021), where deleveraging leads to a tightening of borrowing constraints. Models that do not display this unique property cannot account for sudden stops driven solely by an exogenous increase in the foreign interest rate.====Although our model focuses on fundamentals, rather than self-fulfilling beliefs, a sudden stop is still inefficient. As in Mendoza (2002), agents do not internalize the impact of their deleveraging on the value of collateral. The policy maker internalizes the effect of deleveraging on the value of collateral. At the point where further deleveraging would cause the borrowing constraint to bind, the policy maker should act to prevent further deleveraging and thus keep the value of collateral high enough to sustain the non-binding equilibrium.====This presents a dilemma however. For a successful foreign exchange intervention policy, it is vital for the central bank to prevent the economy from hitting a binding borrowing constraint, since once that happens, it is too late - the sudden stop will have occurred, with a discrete collapse in consumption, borrowing, and the real exchange rate. But absent any frictions in international capital markets, foreign exchange intervention will have no traction in states of the world where the borrowing constraint is slack. To resolve this problem, we introduce intermediary frictions in private capital markets, following Gabaix and Maggiori (2015). These frictions drive a wedge between domestic and world interest rates, and prevent the private sector from fully offsetting a central bank foreign exchange intervention.====As in Devereux et al. (2019) and others, the policy maker could implement optimal policy and minimize the possibility of sudden stop crises this through the use of capital controls. However, Fernandez et al. (2015) show that empirically, capital controls are markedly acyclical, and not deployed in response to booms and busts in capital flows. On the other hand, as we describe below, there is ample evidence of countries using foreign exchange intervention as a cyclical policy instrument. Moreover, Davis et al. (2021) show that under certain conditions an optimal tax on capital flows can be exactly replicated by foreign exchange intervention.====However, as mentioned but not explored by Davis et al. (2021), there is a key asymmetry that may make break this equivalence between optimal capital controls policy and optimal foreign exchange intervention. Apart from a very few limited examples that we discuss in the text, foreign exchange reserves cannot be negative. In response to an exogenous shock that would call for the central bank to stimulate the economy, and increase domestic consumption to support the real exchange rate, optimal capital controls policy would call for the central bank to impose capital outflow controls to arrest capital flight and lower the domestic interest rate. Alternatively the central bank could accomplish this by selling foreign exchange reserves. But if the central bank's stock of reserves is low the central bank may not be able to sell enough reserves to accomplish the desired goal.====This asymmetry in foreign exchange intervention, that the central bank can always buy sufficient quantity of reserves but may not always be able to sell a sufficient quantity of reserves is what makes the optimal foreign exchange intervention problem different from the optimal capital control problem. There is an ex-ante component to optimal foreign exchange intervention policy, in order to have reserves to sell in a crisis the central bank must accumulate reserves in advance of the crisis.====But this is costly, since it is forcing the private sector to engage in excess saving. The same intermediary friction which gives foreign exchange intervention traction in averting a crisis in periods of high borrowing costs makes the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves distortionary in normal times. Just as the sale of foreign exchange reserves would lead the economy to consume and borrow more, the central bank purchase of foreign exchange reserves would force the economy to consume less and save more. This distortion of agents' optimal consumption plans represents the cost to acquiring reserves. In effect, government borrowing to finance foreign exchange purchases ‘crowds out’ private borrowing, as described in Chang (2018).====The central results of the paper describe the trade-off that the central bank must make to balance the cost of acquiring reserves ex-ante against the benefits of preventing a sudden stop crisis ex-post. We show this first in a simplified version of the model in which there is effectively only a one-period decision problem for the central bank. We then extend the model to allow for a full quantitative evaluation of the optimal reserve management policy. In the calibrated model, we find that reserve management policy is successful in dramatically reducing the frequency and severity of sudden stops, but due to the trade-off between costs and benefits of raising reserves, the optimal policy does not completely eliminate sudden stops.====Our paper is related to a growing recent theoretical literature on foreign exchange intervention. An early paper by Jeanne and Ranciere (2011) models reserves as an insurance contract to prevent sudden stops. Durdu et al. (2009) also model reserve accumulation as insurance against a sudden stop resulting from domestic shocks. Chang et al. (2015) and Cavallino (2019) look at optimal foreign exchange intervention in a linear-quadratic New Keynesian model. Adrian et al. (2022) explore how capital flow management and foreign exchange intervention help strengthen monetary trade-offs. In these models foreign exchange intervention is an additional tool that helps to stabilize the economy in the presence of portfolio shocks. Fanelli and Straub (2021) model optimal foreign exchange intervention in a setting where the central bank tries to manipulate the price of non-traded goods for distributional considerations. Hur and Kondo (2016) and Bianchi et al. (2018) both consider the use of reserves to mitigate rollover risk in sovereign debt. Arce et al. (2019) present a model where the fact that private agents don't internalize the effect of their own external borrowing on the value of collateral leads the private sector to borrow more than is efficient. By acquiring foreign exchange reserves the central bank can force the economy as a whole to save more and thus lead to the efficient level of borrowing.====In a stylized three-period model, Cespedes et al. (2017) and Bocola and Lorenzoni (2020) develop models with multiple equilibria ex-post. The central bank can eliminate bad equilibria by implementing a lender of last resort policy if it has accumulated a sufficient stock of reserves. In Jeanne and Sandri (2020) both private and central bank foreign assets can serve as insurance against a sudden stop in foreign liabilities, but private agents do not internalize the insurance role of their stock of foreign assets. In Cespedes and Chang (2020), the central bank acquires reserves ex-ante to lend to banks following a shock to banks' collateral constraint. In Chi et al. (2021), the central bank uses an interest rate on private bank reserves to substitute for capital controls, raising interest on reserves when the economy hits the borrowing constraint, thus reducing inefficient underborrowing in a downturn.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some brief empirical evidence to suggest that an increase in the world risk free rate leads to increases in the probability of systemic sudden stops. The model is presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the mechanics of a sudden stop following a shock to the world interest rate and the optimal policy response. Numerical results from a global solution of the model and a numerical solution for optimal policy is presented in Section 5.

Banks play a special role in this regard: in their function as financial intermediaries and central dealers, they provide essential foreign exchange services to firms that are active in international product and factor markets and wish to manage inherent cross currency cash flows (e.g., Ethier, 1973; Duffie, 2010). However, when banks supply foreign exchange credit and derivatives to firms, they build up foreign exchange positions. If those positions are not balanced across banks' different assets and liabilities, this leads to currency mismatches and related exposure to exchange rate risk in the banking system (e.g., Gabaix and Maggiori, 2015).====Our understanding of the role of banks' unbalanced foreign currency positions in the transmission of exchange rate shocks to the real economy is yet underdeveloped for two main reasons. First, in the past, these concerns have been predominantly raised and studied in the context of emerging markets and their exchange rate policies (e.g., Krugman, 1999; Calvo and Reinhart, 2002; Chang and Velasco, 2006). Second, for identification, a thorough empirical analysis requires comprehensive and granular microdata on banks' on- ==== off-balance-sheet foreign currency positions, which have not yet been available in most countries. This paper tackles both aspects and estimates the causal transmission of foreign exchange shocks to the real economy through bank balance sheets. Specifically, we show that banks' net currency mismatches create losses when exchange rates move adversely, affecting banks' equity, causing a broad contraction in the lending of these banks, including to firms without any exchange rate exposure to begin with, thereby hampering firms' ability to borrow and invest.====We infer our insights from an empirical identification strategy that exploits the period leading up to and immediately following the United Kingdom's referendum to leave the European Union (Brexit referendum hereafter) in 2016. The Brexit referendum serves our purpose for two main reasons. First, the period between the announcement of the referendum on February 22, 2016, and the actual referendum on June 23, 2016, is characterized by increasing uncertainty about the post-referendum value of the British Pound (GBP). This period is excellent for identification, as we can study how exposed firms' demand for GBP risk protection changes and how banks, conditional on their on-balance-sheet GBP assets and liabilities, position themselves vis-à-vis these derivatives demand shifts from the nonfinancial sector, allowing us to identify cross-bank variation in banks' overall GBP exposure. Second, the outcome of the referendum caused the pound to depreciate 12% against the euro and similarly against all other major currencies. We can thus use the period following the exchange rate shock to study how unbalanced total currency positions (i.e., including both on- and off-balance-sheet GBP positions) before such a shock may unravel and affect individual counterparties, broader financial markets, and the real economy when the exchange rate risk materializes. For the second key component of our empirical identification, we assemble a unique combination of supervisory microdata sources from Germany that provide a detailed view into the different elements of the transmission channel.====Our robust key results can be summarized as follows. For the period between the referendum's announcement and its actual date, we find that (nonbank) firms increased their use of forward derivatives (measured by gross notional value of GBP forward contracts) with German banks by about 23% on average. The increase in hedging coincided with elevated exchange rate uncertainty. Moreover, we find this increase in derivatives contracts for firms that committed to buying pounds forward (long exposure) and those that agreed to sell pounds forward (short exposure), leading to small net exposure in the aggregate. However, this aggregate view masks important cross-industry heterogeneity in firms' net short exposures (that is, the difference between short and long positions) to the post-Brexit pound value, which is in part driven by structural cross-industry variation in net exports to the United Kingdom.====Banks, as central counterparties to these derivatives transactions, increased their supply of GBP forwards in the period before the referendum date, but also with sizable and growing heterogeneity in their net GBP derivatives position, suggesting that some banks did not fully intermediate the migrated risk. In fact, about 20% of the banks had accumulated a derivatives exposure of at least 15% of their equity value before the referendum date. Importantly, we show that a bank's net GBP derivatives exposure at the referendum date is closely linked to skewed client demand stemming from (ex-ante) industry concentration among its derivatives clients. For example, banks that supplied derivatives to industries with an increased demand for net short positions in the run-up to the referendum tended to have a net long exposure just before the Brexit referendum.The tight link between industry concentration and net derivatives exposure holds after we account for banks' on-balance-sheet net GBP assets, which could potentially offset the risks from a nonzero GBP derivatives exposure. Building on this insight, we exploit industry-specific hedging demand shifts in combination with heterogeneous sector exposure across banks to identify variation in cross-bank total (on- and off-balance sheet) GBP exposure and ultimate losses from these exposures.====After the referendum, the pound's value plummeted about 12% relative to the euro, and banks with a total (net) long GBP exposure incurred losses. Using marked-to-market valuation of individual forward contracts and on-balance-sheet exposure, we show that for 10% of banks the total loss was larger than 13% of their equity value. These GBP total losses in turn affected banks' credit supply: Banks that experienced large losses from their net GBP total exposure (and thus an adverse shock to their net worth) differentially cut back credit to firms. Our baseline estimate indicates an average elasticity of −0.73, suggesting that for a one-percentage-point GBP total loss, a bank cuts back credit supply by 73 basis points, on average—with substantially stronger effects for banks with a lower equity-to-assets ratio, consistent with the notion that capital constraints are binding.====We identify these spillovers from GBP losses into credit supply using a difference-in-differences regression approach in combination with instrumental variables estimation. Specifically, to identify exogenous variation in GBP losses across banks, we instrument GBP losses with banks' heterogeneous industry concentration in their GBP derivatives books interacted with industry-specific derivatives demand shift (shift-share instrument). Granular information on the entirety of banks' onand off-balance sheet activity allows us to isolate the effect of GBP losses on credit by controlling for losses from other lines of business that may correlate with banks industry specialization; in particular, a deterioration in credit quality of borrowers from an industry with large exposure to the United Kingdom or other potentially correlated investments (including non-GBP currency positions, non-GBP derivatives, and non-FX derivatives). Moreover, we exploit within-borrower variation in credit growth after the Brexit referendum, which we link to heterogeneous GBP losses across banks. By comparing different banks' credit growth for the same borrower in the same quarter, we control for a potential reduction in a firm's credit demand after the referendum (Khwaja and Mian, 2008). The identifying assumption behind this approach requires that changes in firms' credit demand are, in expectation, equally spread across all banks. Given banks' strong industry specialization and hence potentially correlated demand and supply shocks after the referendum's outcome, we test and verify the validity of the Khwaja-Mian approach in our setting following Paravisini et al., 2015, Paravisini et al., 2017.====The identified post-Brexit credit-supply contraction induced by banks' GBP losses had aggregate effects on firms' funding conditions and real economic activity. In particular, our firm-level analysis shows that firms with a strong dependence on banks that suffered GBP losses also experienced an overall cutback in credit after the referendum; that is, they were not able to substitute the loss of funding by increasing borrowing from other banks, which is consistent with previous evidence on the lack of substitutability of bank credit relationships, which may be rooted in asymmetric information problems (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 1995; Chodorow-Reich, 2013). This overall credit contraction for affected firms is about 32% stronger than the average credit contraction after the Brexit referendum and is also present for nonfinancial firms. Moreover, we also show that firms from the non-tradable sectors and firms without any GBP derivatives usage—those that likely did not have any exposure to foreign exchange risk—experienced a credit reduction from banks facing derivatives losses. Finally, we trace the transmission to real activity by showing that German nonfinancial firms with strong ex-ante credit relationships with banks facing GBP losses reduced investment about 2 percentage points more than firms without ties to those banks, thereby strongly contributing to the overall decline in aggregate private investment in Germany in the aftermath of the referendum. We also find that, consistent with credit market frictions (e.g., Gertler and Gilchrist, 1994), the adverse effects on credit and investment are concentrated in small firms.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Reductions in trade barriers increase gross flows relative to value added – a lengthening of value chains – thereby increasing transportation emissions. Reductions in trade barriers also increase wages relative to the price of other goods, which increases the quantity of intermediates relative to labor used in production and, therefore, emissions per value added. Liberalization schemes that temper these channels could achieve substantial output increases with modest increases in CO====.","When analyzing solutions to climate change, economists have long studied how policies can reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by raising relative prices for GHG intensive goods. Much less attention has been paid to understanding how policies unrelated to GHG mitigation can affect GHG levels through similar mechanisms. Since substantial near-term cuts in global GHG emissions are necessary to prevent the worst impacts of climate change (IPCC, 2018), it is important to understand whether, and how, non‑carbon policies work for or against mitigation efforts. Given that natural and man-made trade barriers alter relative prices and therefore the production, composition and movement of goods – especially in the context of pervasive global value chains – and the long literature on the environmental impacts of trade liberalization (see Copeland and Taylor (2004)) it is surprising that the effects of changes in trade policy on GHG emissions have remained relatively unexplored. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by studying how policies that alter trade barriers – including existing global tariffs, global tariff reform scenarios, and transportation efficiency targets – impact global CO==== levels.====Our analysis uncovers the importance of changes in the use and transportation of intermediate inputs in determining the emissions consequences of reduced trade barriers. Reduced trade barriers lead to increased gross output relative to value added, and this effect contributes towards a substantial increase in transportation emissions because these emissions depend directly on the gross flow of goods. Put differently, a reduction in trade barriers effectively entails an increase in shipping per unit of final output. Changes in the pattern of intermediate input use also play a key role in accounting for the increase in production/consumption emissions in response to reduced trade barriers. Reduced trade barriers increase wages relative to the prices of other goods, which means that from a producer perspective labor becomes more expensive relative to intermediate inputs. The resulting increase in the quantity of intermediates relative to labor in production increases emissions per value added for two reasons. First, this logic applies directly to fossil fuels – which are a subset of intermediate inputs – and second, because fossil fuels are more generally embodied in other intermediate inputs.====We quantify these channels using a multi-country, multi-sector quantitative general equilibrium framework with detailed global input-output linkages and with transportation costs that are determined by endogenous fuel prices. Emissions are generated in the model when fossil fuels are used in production, consumption or domestic or international transportation. This framework allows us to capture various channels through which trade barriers might potentially affect emissions, including re-allocation of activity across countries and sectors, and changes in the price and quantity of inputs, including fossil fuels. Using the parsimonious “exact hat algebra” methodology from Dekle et al. (2008), we explore the impacts of existing global tariffs, improvements in transportation efficiency and a range of tariff reform scenarios.====We first analyze how existing global tariffs affect CO==== emissions by evaluating a hypothetical scenario where all tariffs are removed. We find that tariff elimination would increase global GDP by 0.5% and global emissions by 1.8%, implying that trade liberalization would lead to emissions increases beyond the mechanical “scale” effect of the global output increase.==== Production/consumption and transportation emissions each account for half of the increase in total emissions. Tariff removal increases international transportation emissions and decreases domestic transportation emissions, together leading to a 5.33% increase in total transportation emissions. A decomposition reveals that a substantial portion of this increase is due to the expansion in gross output relative to value added, which can also be interpreted as a lengthening of value chains (Fally, 2012). Production emissions increase by 1.22%, and this increase is directly related to the increased use of intermediate inputs on account of the reduction in their price relative to labor. If labor-intermediate substitution is “shut down” using a Leontief version of the model, the production emissions increase is entirely wiped out. Hence, the increased emissions here are due to the substitution towards intermediate inputs that are induced by the increase in wages relative to the prices of other goods.====While our results overall imply that tariffs can lead to decreased emissions that proportionately exceed the output decrease, this does not, however, imply that tariffs are likely to be a desirable mitigation instrument. The implied mitigation costs of existing tariffs for example – around 550 $/tCO==== – are far above other policy options (Gillingham and Stock, 2018). Even if we value the negative externality from carbon emissions at 200 $/tCO====, which is a relatively high value suggested by the current literature (Daniel et al., 2019; Hänsel et al., 2020), the benefit of the output increase from tariff reductions easily exceeds the externality costs.====Motivated by the prevalence of efforts aiming to reduce the fuel intensity of transportation, we next study the global CO==== implications of improvements in transportation efficiency.==== As expected, we find that projected improvements in transportation efficiency reduce transportation emission substantially. However, these improvements tend to increase production emissions by a comparable or even larger magnitude, generally implying relatively modest decreases (or possible increases) in total emissions. Most of the increase in production emissions is again explained by the labor-intermediate substitution channel. On the other hand, the reduction in transportation emissions in response to the efficiency improvements is only modestly tempered by the value chain lengthening. The lengthening effect for efficiency improvements is much weaker than for tariffs for two reasons. First, efficiency improvements induce shifts towards sectors with shorter value chains because fuel costs for transportation tend to be higher on upstream, and therefore shorter value chain, sectors. Second, unlike with tariffs, the global GDP increase from improved transportation efficiency is partially due the effective freeing up of resources previously spent on transportation, an effect that causes a relatively proportionate increase in gross output to value added and in turn mutes changes in value chain lengths.====We also analyze the emissions consequences of various partial tariff liberalization scenarios. While realistic liberalization schemes tend to increase emissions, there is great variability in the CO==== generated at comparable levels of liberalization. We find liberalization schemes that focus on reducing tariff escalation – the common situation where tariffs are higher on goods that tend to be used more for final consumption than as inputs – can, up to a point, increase global welfare with a very small increase in CO====. This is because such policies limit the expansion of gross output relative to value added by concentrating tariff cuts on goods that are less likely to be used as inputs. There are broadly comparable effects from partial liberalization schemes that focus on reducing higher initial tariffs, such as a “Swiss Formula” approach that entails proportionately greater tariff reductions on initially higher tariffs or reducing “tariff peaks” – tariffs that are substantially higher than average.====Our paper is related to several strands of the trade and environment literature. In analyzing how trade barriers affect transportation emissions, our paper is especially connected to Shapiro (2016) and Cristea et al. (2013). Both papers quantify the increased emissions that results from goods traveling further when trade costs are reduced. Shapiro especially emphasizes the substitution from domestic to international transportation, while Cristea et al. highlight the fact that tariffs tend to be higher between more distant countries. While these mechanisms are present in our analysis as well, we uncover the key role of intermediate input trade in magnifying the emissions consequences of reduced trade barriers. Reducing trade barriers increases transportation emissions in substantial part by expanding the amount of gross flows for the same value added. In interpreting this channel as the lengthening of value chains, our work illustrates a key connection between the trade and environment literature and the literature on value chains (e.g., Johnson (2018)).==== Our paper is also closely connected to Shapiro (2021), who documents and explains a negative environmental bias – tariffs are higher on relatively cleaner downstream vs. relatively dirtier upstream industries – in the structure of existing tariffs and notes that undoing this bias could lead to carbon-negative increases in global GDP. Our paper complements Shapiro (2021) first, by emphasizing the interaction between tariffs, intermediate input use and emissions from transportation as noted above, a relationship that cannot directly be disentangled in Shapiro's framework. Second, even in connection with production emissions, we highlight a channel that functions through labor-intermediate substitution and is, therefore, distinct from Shapiro's point, which is about the structure of tariffs ==== industries. The labor-intermediate effect we emphasize does not rely on pre-existing tariff patterns and therefore would more generally apply to any policies or trends that differentially affect the price of labor vs. intermediate inputs.====Unlike each of these papers, we study the impacts of reductions in tariffs and in natural trade barriers due to energy efficiency improvements. Our analysis therefore brings new insights to a broader literature that contrasts trade barriers (e.g., Felbermayr et al. (2015); Besedes and Cole (2017); Jiao and Wei (2020)) by showing that tariffs and natural trade barriers have differential impacts on value chains and environmental outcomes, due to both fundamental differences in how these barriers affect output and systematic difference in the pattern of the barriers. Pothen and Hübler (2018) also study the CO==== impacts of different types of trade barriers, but they do not emphasize the comparison across types of barriers, changes in transportation emissions or changes in value chains.====More broadly within the trade and environment literature the overarching theme – whether in the context of the pollution haven hypothesis, trade liberalization (e.g., Grossman and Krueger (1993), Antweiler et al. (2001), Cherniwchan (2017)) or hypothetical carbon tariffs (e.g., Böhringer et al. (2015), Larch and Wanner (2017)) – has been on studying the environmental consequences of the geographical and industrial reallocation of economic activity as a result of trade-related policies. Our work complements this general emphasis by uncovering a distinct channel linking trade policy to GHGs that is not directly about sectoral or regional reallocation, namely, that trade policy instruments such as tariffs affect the use and transportation of intermediate inputs. We show that these intermediate input channels also play an important role in determining the effect of hypothetical carbon tariffs.====Beyond the trade and environment literature, our work helps inform the broader question of the effect of non-climate policies and trends on GHGs. As noted in National Research Council (2013), there is limited research on how non‑carbon policies, other than energy related policies, influence GHG emissions. The exploratory work in this report finds that broad-based tax incentives in the US influence GHGs almost exclusively through changes in GDP. In contrast, our analysis suggests that an important factor in whether a non‑carbon policy may affect CO==== levels is the extent to which the policy functions as a tax on intermediate inputs. We demonstrate that this mechanism is likely to be very relevant in the context of other taxes that partly function as taxes on intermediate inputs. More generally, any policy that differentially affects the cost of labor vs. material inputs – such as wage subsidies or minimum wage policies – are likely to have emissions consequences through the labor-intermediate channel we identify. Finally, beyond specific policies, our analysis reveals potential environmental consequences of global production structures that affect the level of gross vs. value added output and trade flows (e.g., Johnson and Noguera (2012) or Johnson and Noguera (2017)).====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

Recent literature has proposed models to forecast exchange rates at medium- and long-horizons. Such tests suffer from small-sample bias but inferring the true test distribution is difficult. We propose two approaches to address the problem. First, since economists are interested in the value of economic models versus purely statistical models, we propose a horse-race that pits the economic models not against the random walk, but against the forecasts from the level of the exchange rate. These economic models are challenged because the level of the exchange rate appears to be a more powerful predictor than “global risk” variables. We also propose a second more general but less powerful test. But with both tests we demonstrate using bootstraps that the random walk cannot be rejected, so the predictive power of the lagged exchange rate and many other variables is illusory.","The “gold standard” for testing exchange rate models is evidence they can produce lower mean-squared forecast errors of changes in the exchange rate than the random walk prediction of no change. For many years, the literature has consistently found that macroeconomic variables are not helpful in forecasting the U.S. dollar exchange rate change. This forecasting failure has been considered a significant shortcoming of the conventional models – an indication of “exchange rate disconnect.” Meese and Rogoff (1983) first demonstrated that the exchange-rate models of the 1970s were not helpful for forecasting. Mark (1995) attempted to rescue the standard approach by showing that there might be long-run forecasting power from simple traditional models. Engel and West (2005) prove that under some conditions, the inability to forecast future changes in exchange rates might be an inherent feature of many monetary models. Rossi (2013) surveys well over one hundred papers on the topic but concludes “the predictive ability of the fundamentals is time-varying and occasional.” This conclusion agrees with the studies of Cheung et al., 2005, Cheung et al., 2019, who find “model/specification/currency combinations that work well in one period and one performance metric will not necessarily work well in another period and alternative performance metric.” Itskhoki and Mukhin (2021) list the random-walk behavior of the exchange rate as the first in their list of major puzzles that “conventional international macro models” cannot account for.====This puzzle has been a stumbling block for macroeconomic models of exchange rates, because, as Rogoff (2007) puts it, “Ultimately, there is no question that the aim is to have models that can forecast out of sample (as opposed to simply fit out of sample), as well as models that are useful for policy analysis.” Moreover, Alvarez et al. (2007) argue that random-walk behavior of exchange rates is incompatible with economic models that imply monetary policy has no effect on ex ante excess returns (that is, models in which uncovered interest parity holds.) Also, from the perspective of predicting excess returns, given that nominal exchange rate changes are much more volatile than nominal interest rate differentials, an inability to reject a random walk in exchange rates generally coincides with low power in forecasting excess returns. For example, as Engel, 1996, Engel, 2014 notes, while the well-known Fama (1984) test for uncovered interest parity finds evidence that the interest rate differential has statistically significant forecasting power for excess returns, the R-squared of those regressions tends to be very low.====In recent years, new studies have found evidence of predictability, particularly at medium-run horizons of 1- to 5- years, especially using measures of global financial and economic uncertainty to help forecast the dollar in data over the past two decades. These studies rely on the well-established notion that economic models might be able to predict at longer horizons even when their short-run forecasting is weak if the “true” model involves a complex lag structure or non-linearities which are difficult to specify precisely. (See in particular Kilian and Taylor (2003), Marcellino et al. (2006) and Pincheira and West (2016). The survey of exchange rate forecasting by Rossi (2013) considers the “direct method” of forecasting at longer horizons.)====A drawback of long-horizon forecasts is small-sample bias. When time series are persistent, a sample as small as the 22 years since the advent of the euro may be “small”, in that test statistics might be subject to considerable biases that are not easily corrected with standard statistics. As the literature has shown, it is not so easy to assess this small sample bias using simulation methods when the forecasts are based on some variable or variables, ====. How should ==== be modeled when the null is that the change in the log of the exchange rate, ==== − ====, is unforecastable? We could model ==== as being independent of ====, but more plausibly innovations in ==== are correlated with innovations in ====, Measuring this correlation requires a model for innovations in ====.====Also, there is the question of whether ==== is stationary. For example, we find that the detrended log of Overnight Repo outstanding of the primary dealers might have considerable forecasting power for changes in the exchange rate. But if this variable has a unit root, then forecasting models based on regressions of ==== − ==== on ==== are unbalanced. If we treat ==== as an I(1) variable, we not only need to consider whether or not its innovations are correlated with innovations in ==== under the null hypothesis, but also whether or not it is cointegrated with ====.====We propose two solutions to this problem of assessing the small-sample bias. The first makes use of the fact that researchers are not interested in forecasting the exchange rate per se, but rather whether economic or financial models are useful in making forecasts. We propose to examine whether a set of economic variables – in particular, measures of “global risk” which recent literature has focused on – add forecasting power to the lagged level of the log of the exchange rate itself. In other words, we suggest replacing the random walk norm with the standard of “can the model out-forecast the lagged exchange rate?” Even if macroeconomic models do forecast better than the random walk, they still would not meet the Rogoff (2007) criterion of being useful for making predictions if they produce worse forecasts than the simple projection based on the level of the exchange rate.====The standard in the literature has been, in essence, to estimate the ====horizon equation:====Evidence of “in-sample” predictive power of the economic model is whether the parameter ==== is significantly different than zero. Out-of-sample forecasting ability estimates (1) over rolling samples to create forecasts that can be compared to the forecasts of some standard, usually the random walk. But we suggest estimating:====If ==== is not different than zero in this regression (for the in-sample forecasting test), or if the inclusion of ==== does not improve the forecasting power out of sample for this model, researchers still face the problem that the economic variables do not contribute to the predictive power of a simple time-series specification.====In fact, using exchange rates of G10 currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (the non-dollar G10 currencies are the Australian dollar (AUD), Canadian dollar (CAD), Swiss franc (CHF), the euro (EUR), U.K. pound sterling (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY), Norwegian krone (NOK), New Zealand dollar (NZD), and Swedish krona (SWE)), we generally find in our empirical applications that ==== is not statistically significant in estimates of (2), even when it is in (1). Also, we find that setting ==== = 0 in (2) produces better forecasts both in- and out-of-sample than specification (1). That is, a univariate forecast based on the level of the exchange rate appears to be better than forecasts based on the global financial variables. Additionally, inclusion of ==== in Eq. (2) does not significantly improve out-of-sample predictive power relative to the specification in which ==== = 0.====But we go farther. It appears that univariate forecasts of ==== − ==== based on ==== alone are significantly better than the random walk forecast of no change using statistical methods typically employed in the literature. In-sample medium-horizon (12-month, 36-month and 60-month) forecasts of the change in the exchange rate produce eye-popping ====-squared values. At the 60-month horizon, the ====-squared of the forecast of the change in the dollar exchange rates, in which only the level of the exchange rate is used to forecast future changes, is 0.76 for simple average of G9 currencies, >0.7 for six of the ten exchange rates, and >0.6 for all but one of the currencies. Moreover, we find that tests of out-of-sample forecasting power of the level of the exchange rate based on rolling regressions produce large Clark and West (2006) statistics that, under the asymptotic distribution (and corrected for serial correlation), are very highly significant for medium-horizon forecasts. However, these tests are also subject to sizeable small-sample bias.====We use bootstrap and Monte Carlo methods to correct for the small-sample properties of the test statistics more accurately. It is easy to make mistaken inference in assessing forecasts at these horizons, as a large literature has established, because of problems in serial correlation of forecast errors, small-sample bias in parameter estimates and in establishing the correct statistical distribution of test statistics when the exchange rate has a unit root under the null hypothesis (of a random walk) but is stationary or cointegrated with other economic variables under the alternative. These problems come into play in forecasting the dollar at medium horizons because the dollar is persistent but “borderline” stationary. Simulation-based tests are simple to construct in this case because there is no auxiliary variable to model under the null hypothesis. (There are also analytic corrections for small-sample bias, but we rely on simulation methods because they are easy to implement, and the properties of such simulations are well established in the univariate case under the null of a random walk.) The tests indicate we may not be able to reject the simple hypothesis that the exchange rates follow a random walk at standard significance levels. While the small-sample biases in the “long-horizon” regressions have been examined in depth, less attention has been paid to the problems with the Clark-West tests for medium-horizon forecasts. We find that simulation-based tests of out-of-sample forecasting power for the level of the exchange rate cannot reject the null of a random walk.====When we use simulation methods to correct for short-sample bias, we find that the in-sample forecasting power of the univariate model is not generally significantly better than that of a simple random walk at all the forecast horizons and, our simulation methods show that the forecast based on the level of the exchange rate does not significantly outperform the random walk in out-of-sample forecasting exercises. These findings pose a challenge for exchange rate forecasts based on economic models. It stands to reason that these models, which use economic and financial variables to forecast exchange rates, may also be subject to small-sample biases that are not easily corrected for with standard statistics.====Our second method proposes a simple universal procedure to simulate the global risk measures. Here, we find very limited evidence for rejecting the null of a random walk. This leads us to conclude that the small-sample properties of forecasts based on economic variables must be carefully investigated.====This second test might not be powerful relative to particular specifications of the behavior of the auxiliary macro/financial variables under the null hypothesis. In fact, we emphasize at this point that our purpose here is not to criticize any specific study that has demonstrated empirical support for an exchange rate model. We have not tried to reproduce the exact specification of any model from the literature, so further study may find that some models hold up against concerns about small-sample bias. We instead intend simply to suggest that extra care be given in assessing the goodness of fit of in-sample medium-run forecasts and the out-of-sample forecasting power of models over medium horizons. (Some recent papers are Adrian and Xie (2020), Ca'Zorzi and Rubaszek (2020), Darvas and Schepp (2020), Eichenbaum et al. (2021), Evans (2020), Jiang et al. (2021), Kremens and Martin (2019), Lilley et al. (2019), Lustig et al. (2016), Liu and Shaliastovich (2022) and Ma and Zhang (2020).)====We suggest exploring whether economic and financial variables improve upon the forecasts of the current log-level exchange rate even when the forecasting power of the exchange rate by itself does not stand up to corrections for small-sample bias. If the level of the exchange rate itself produces forecasts of the medium-run change in the exchange rate that have lower mean-squared error than the economic and financial variables, but in turn is subject to small-sample bias, then small-sample bias must be a concern for the economic models. Moreover, in different, or longer samples, perhaps there will emerge evidence of the long-horizon forecasting power of the level of the exchange rate (and, in fact, in many cases in our study, while the random walk is not rejected, it nearly is at standard confidence levels.) But whether or not that happens, the Rogoff (2007) forecasting criterion for assessing economic models of the exchange rate surely would require that the model out-forecast the level (of the log) of the exchange rate.====In section 2, we examine the forecasting power of various economic and financial measures relative to the level of the exchange rate itself. In section 3, we re-examine the univariate exchange rate model using simulation methods. In section 4, we discuss a simple universal procedure (the second approach) to address the concern. We offer some conclusions and suggestions in the final section.",Forecasting the U.S. Dollar in the 21,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199623000016,11 January 2023,2023,Research Article,31.0

However, our quantitative results suggest that doubts about the model need to be large to make a “laissez-faire regime” better than an intervention regime.","Since the global financial crisis there has been a new push in favor of macroprudential regulation in order to safeguard financial stability both in advanced and emerging countries. Fig. 1 provides information on macroprudential policy measures taken by IMF member countries from a survey conducted in 2018. It shows that most of these tools are aimed at managing liquidity and currency mismatches in the balance sheets of the banking sector, as well as restricting credit (e.g., capital buffers and loan to value caps).==== The survey also reports that there are, on average, nine macroprudential instruments in place per country (as of 2018). Following the seminal papers by Bianchi and Mendoza (2010) and Bianchi (2011), several studies have analyzed how different financial frictions can lead to inefficient overborrowing which justifies the implementation of these regulatory measures. The average tax on debt reported in the literature varies from 3.6 to 5%, which almost eliminates the long-run probability of financial crises. However, the welfare gains are usually not too large and sometimes even ambiguous. The benefits of macroprudential policies are even less clear in the midst of uncertainty about the nature of the shocks the economy might be subject to. Thus, much debate remains on whether prudential taxes should at all be imposed given the possibility that the model regulators have in mind may not be an accurate characterization of the real world. Both in academic and policy circles, it is relevant to analyze how robust these optimal prudential taxes are to potential misspecifications of the model that governs the shocks to the economy. Our paper informs this debate by concluding that, even when regulators design policy based on an “incorrect” model, for ==== misspecification macroprudential policies are generally welfare improving.====This paper illustrates how macroprudential policies that are robust to model misspecification (Hansen and Sargent, 2016) generally lead to welfare gains, which can indeed be significant when the policy maker engages in prudent behavior while the household does not. Specifically, robust policies refer to the case where the decision maker is not sure about the probabilities that are governing the evolution of shocks in the economy. Instead of considering just one probability distribution (a reference model), the planner will account for the fact that there is a set of distributions for shocks that could fit the data as well as the reference model, and should implement a policy that is optimal under the worst case scenario (i.e., the policy that does not create vulnerabilities if one of the non-reference models turns out to be the true one).==== In the words of Hansen and Sargent (VOX - 2019): “Prudent decision making should acknowledge what we do not know… Policy makers should strive to quantify the dimensions of their ignorance and adjust their decisions accordingly.”====We evaluate the robustness of macroprudential instruments by introducing fear of model misspecification into the canonical model of optimal macroprudential policies developed in Bianchi (2011). This paper rationalizes and justifies the need for macroprudential policy on the basis of a financial friction that generates sudden stops within the business cycle. This friction takes the form of an occasionally binding collateral constraint that generates a pecuniary externality. Specifically, the value of the collateral that constrains households' borrowing depends on aggregate indebtedness. However, given that individuals are price takers, they fail to internalize how their borrowing decisions impact the price of the collateral. This externality leads to inefficient overborrowing. Instead, the planner internalizes the pecuniary externality and increases precautionary savings that can reduce both the magnitude and likelihood of a crisis when the collateral constraint becomes binding. Bianchi (2011) shows that the efficient allocation can be achieved through the implementation of macroprudential debt taxes.====Our contribution is to adapt this workhorse model to an environment in which there is a fear of model uncertainty from both the planner and/or households following the framework in Hansen and Sargent (2016). We take the model in Bianchi (2011) as our benchmark model, in which both the planner and household make their optimal decisions under the true probability distribution. Under model misspecification, agents fear that the transition probabilities they are considering may not be the correct ones. Thus, they will now make their optimal decisions by considering a set of alternative probabilities that are not too far from the reference model.==== Under robustness, agents make their optimal decisions as if an “evil” agent chooses the worst-case density among all those possible distributions surrounding the reference distribution. In this setup, the decentralized equilibrium may differ from the social planner's equilibrium both because of the pecuniary externalities associated with the collateral constraint and because of the paternalistic imposition of the planner's beliefs when designing policy. When robust agents have doubts about the model, they create endogenous worst-case beliefs by assigning a high probability to low-utility events. The ratio of worst-case beliefs of the planner over the household's captures the degree of paternalism.====When the views of the world differ between planner and household, or these are different than the true underlying model, intervention via macroprudential taxes can result in smaller welfare gains or even losses. These losses can occur when the social planner imposes, by means of its paternalistic motive, an incorrect view of the world. While this is a theoretical possibility, in our quantitative analysis we find that, for a reasonable degree of robustness, even when “mistaken”, a social planner's intervention generates welfare gains. The inneficiency introduced by imposing an incorrect view of the world is small relative to the efficiency gains from internalizing the pecuniary externality. Moreover, if it were the case that the robust social planner's beliefs are correct, welfare gains can be sizeable and indeed larger than those implied without considering robustness.====Our results are four-fold. First, we find that introducing fear of model misspecification leads the planner to increase savings, for precautionary motives, in every possible state of the world when the collateral constraint is not binding. The reason behind this result is that she is now assigning higher probabilities to worse shocks tomorrow relative to the case without robustness. We note, however, that these precautionary motives are weaker than those of a non-robust planner that instead features higher risk aversion. Decisions under robustness and under higher risk aversion are very similar close to the binding region because a robust planner is assigning a high probability to future negative shocks and thus behaves similarly to a high risk-averse agent. But the further away the economy is from this binding region, the worst-case scenario is a more favorable one and so a robust planner chooses levels of debt higher than would a more risk-averse agent who remains cautious.====Second, we find that the optimal taxes over the region at which the collateral constraint is close to binding depend on the planner's degree of robustness relative to the household's. For instance, if we model a planner who fears misspecification while households make their decisions under the reference model, then the difference between the planner and households' debt levels widens and leads to higher macroprudential taxes than in Bianchi (2011). For the purposes of correcting pecuniary externalities, taxes are needed when bond holdings are close to the region where the constraint is binding. In addition, for the purpose of saving as a precaution against the worst-case scenario in the future, this widening of the optimal bond holdings justifies the introduction of higher taxes to reduce households' borrowing over all the non-binding region. In the long-run, a robust planner imposes taxes that are about 5 percentage points higher than a non-robust planner.====Third, our main contribution is to provide an answer to whether a planner should intervene ex-ante and implement a macroprudential tax when there is model uncertainty. Although taxes are higher than in the non-robust case, these will not result in larger welfare gains if shocks are truly governed by the reference model. If households also make choices that are robust to model misspecification, the gains are significantly reduced. This is because the household already saves more as a precaution against future bad shocks, indirectly addressing the overborrowing problem due to the pecuniary externality. A highly-robust planner “underborrows” and induces welfare losses. However, if the worst-case scenario that the robust agents fear is the one that actually governs the evolution of shocks, then welfare gains are among the largest we find. Overall, we find that an ex-ante intervention is generally welfare improving even in cases in which the social planner is “wrong”’ (i.e., her beliefs do not coincide with the actual model generating the shocks). Doubts about the model need to be implausibly high in order to make a “laissez-faire regime” better than an intervention regime.====Fourth, we find that the long run probability of a crisis is further reduced by a robust planner's allocation relative to what a non-robust planner achieves because introducing model uncertainty leads to higher savings overall. This result holds even if the social planner is wrong about the underlying probability model generating the shocks.====This paper relates mainly to two strands of the literature. First, following the seminal contribution of Bianchi (2011), a vast literature has emerged that rationalizes macroprudential policies as measures to minimize the effects of distortions arising from financial frictions. Relative to Bianchi (2011), Benigno et al. (2013) analyze a production economy model in which the pecuniary externality arises because agents fail to internalize the effect of their decisions on the relative price of non-tradable goods. Boz et al. (2012) highlight the importance of considering the information set of policymakers in the design of macroprudential policies. Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2017) characterize the optimal capital control policy in an economy with a collateral constraint in which both tradable and non-tradable goods have collateral value, and find that, contrary to the general wisdom, the optimal prudential policy is procyclical. Acosta et al. (2019) extend the model of Bianchi (2011) by incorporating an Ss-type cost of implementing macroprudential taxes to generate “sticky” optimal capital controls. Basu et al., 2020, Basu et al., 2022 characterize the optimal joint use of monetary policy, capital controls, and foreign exchange intervention. While all these papers justify the use of macroprudential policies, they do not consider the robustness of the optimal policy (in the sense of Hansen and Sargent, 2016) which is the focus of our paper.====Second, our study relates to the literature on robust control methods pioneered by Hansen and Sargent (2016). A growing theoretical macro literature extend canonical models to the case in which the social planner and/or private agents fear model misspecification and search for robust policies under worst-case scenarios. Pouzo and Presno (2016) and Roch and Roldan (2023) show that the introduction of robust international lenders have imporant quantitative implications in sovereign default models. Adam and Woodford (2012) introduce the robustness framework in a New Keynesian model to analyze optimal robust monetary policy. Bidder and Smith (2012) develop an algorithm to apply robust control methods within nonlinear DSGE models, and show that the interaction between time varying risk and robustness provides an amplification mechanism for volatility shocks (which they interpret as animal spirits). Karantounias, 2013, Karantounias, 2020 show that the degree of paternalism and pessimistic expectation management are the key forces shaping optimal policy in setups with model uncertainty.====Young (2012) is the paper closest to ours as it also studies robust macroprudential policy but in a production economy with occasionally binding constraints. But we differ in two important aspects: (i) he takes into consideration policies that are not prudential in spirit, but rather he focuses more on interventions that occur at the time of a crisis (i.e., when the collateral constraint binds); and, (ii) we examine more carefully how to interpret results when we have planner and/or agents that actually disagree on the view of the world that they have.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. First, Section 2 lays out the canonical model of pecuniary externalities developed by Bianchi (2011) and adds model misspecification following the approach of Hansen and Sargent (2016). Section 3 presents the quantitative results.

The mean quarterly MPC across Peruvian income deciles is 0.204, which translates to a mean annualized MPC of 0.545–0.592 under both model-free and model-based annualization methods. To compare Peruvian and U.S. MPCs reflecting the different reference periods of the underlying surveys, I employ a standard incomplete-market model. Two striking differences emerge. First, the mean annual MPC in Peru is three times as large as that in the U.S. Second, the MPCs are substantially more heterogeneous over income deciles in Peru than in the U.S. The model predicts that ==== behavior drives both the higher mean MPC and stronger MPC heterogeneity in Peru.","Macroeconomists have recently discovered that microlevel household consumption-saving behavior and its heterogeneity significantly matter for aggregate dynamics, the effects of monetary and fiscal policies, and their transmission mechanisms. Several works in this line of research have found that these macroeconomic outcomes crucially depend on households' marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of transitory income shocks. For this reason, researchers often discipline macroeconomic models using MPC estimates from nationally representative samples (see, for instance, the estimates from Johnson et al. (2006), Parker et al. (2013), and Blundell et al. (2008)).====However, these estimates are all based on micro data from developed economies. In the context of emerging economies, there is also a long tradition of estimating MPCs using natural experiments (such as weather shocks) or randomized control trials (RCTs), but these studies restrict their focus to certain regions and targeted groups because of the shocks they exploit. As a consequence, nationally representative MPC estimates for an emerging economy, which are suitable for disciplining a macroeconomic model, have been absent.====This paper fills this gap by estimating MPCs out of transitory income shocks using a Peruvian nationally representative household survey (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares, ENAHO====). Specifically, I estimate the MPC within each income decile using Blundell et al. (2008)’s method. Given that the method identifies a group's MPC assuming that MPC is homogeneous within the group, the observations are grouped by an unpredictable component of income (or, equivalently, residual income), as precautionary saving theory predicts MPC heterogeneity over this income.====The estimation yields a mean quarterly MPC across Peruvian income deciles of 20.4%. This quarterly estimate translates to a mean annualized MPC of 59.2% and 54.5% under model-free and model-based annualization methods, respectively. For model-free annualization, I use Auclert (2019)’s MPC annualization formula, which essentially approximates dynamic consumption responses to a transitory shock as exponentially dying out over time. For model-based annualization, I calibrate a standard incomplete-market, life-cycle model by targeting the quarterly MPC estimates and compute true annual MPCs in the model.====Compared to the annual U.S. MPC estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the annualized Peruvian MPCs exhibit two starkly different patterns. First, the Peruvian MPCs are substantially greater overall than the U.S. MPCs. The mean of the annualized Peruvian MPCs across income deciles is approximately seven times as large as the mean of the U.S. estimates (8.3%). Second, the Peruvian MPCs are substantially more heterogeneous over income deciles than the U.S. MPCs.====However, this comparison (model-free comparison hereafter) has a critical problem in that it imposes an asymmetric assumption regarding the time frame. The reference period is a quarter in ENAHO, while it is a year in the PSID. Accordingly, when estimating MPCs using Blundell et al. (2008)’s method, Peruvian households are assumed to receive income shocks and make consumption decisions quarterly, while U.S. households are assumed to do so yearly. If we instead assume that both Peruvian and U.S. households are under the same quarterly time frame, my U.S. MPC estimates are subject to a ‘time aggregation problem’ that Crawley (2020) points out: when Blundell et al. (2008)’s method is applied to annual data while households receive income shocks and make consumption decisions at a higher frequency, the method significantly underestimates consumption sensitivity to transitory shocks. Part of the large gap between U.S. and Peruvian MPCs under the model-free comparison can be attributable to this time aggregation problem.====To compare Peruvian and U.S. MPCs reflecting the different reference periods of the underlying surveys, I employ a standard incomplete-market, life-cycle model. Two model economies are calibrated under the same quarterly time frame: one is fitted to Peru by targeting the Peruvian quarterly MPC estimates, while the other is fitted to the U.S. by targeting the U.S. annual MPC estimates.==== In particular, the U.S. annual MPC estimates are targeted as follows. First, I simulate quarterly income and consumption series from the model and convert them into annual series by aggregating them over every four quarters. Then, the model counterparts of the annual estimates are obtained by applying to the simulated annual series the same estimation procedure applied to the PSID. Lastly, a calibration is conducted such that the model counterparts are as close as possible to the estimates.====I compare model-predicted annual MPCs between the two model economies. I find that the two main differences observed in the model-free comparison remain robust. First, Peruvian MPCs are substantially greater overall than U.S. MPCs. The cross-country mean MPC gap is somewhat smaller than the gap in the model-free comparison because the time aggregation problem is fixed. Nevertheless, the model-based comparison predicts that the mean annual MPC in Peru is 3.0 times as large as that in the U.S. Second, the model-based comparison also predicts that annual MPCs are substantially more heterogeneous over income deciles in Peru than in the U.S.====I examine the causes of the two main differences through the lens of the model and find that households' precautionary saving behavior is the main driver of both the higher mean MPC and stronger MPC heterogeneity in Peru. In this model, households face idiosyncratic income risk and thus exhibit precautionary saving behavior because i) they fear the realization of a low-income path (Kimball, 1990) and ii) they also worry about being hit by borrowing limits (Huggett, 1993). These precautionary saving motives become weaker as households' cash-on-hand (or, equivalently, total currently available resources) increases. Moreover, households with stronger precautionary saving motives exhibit higher MPC because a positive transitory shock relaxes these precautionary saving motives. Peruvian households have substantially stronger precautionary saving motives than U.S. households because they accumulate far fewer liquid assets in the model. Moreover, when households move down from higher to lower income deciles, precautionary saving motives become stronger more rapidly in Peru than in the U.S.====This paper is related to multiple strands of literature. Methodologically, this paper borrows one of the main approaches to obtain nationally representative MPC estimates. Three approaches have been widely accepted in this literature: (i) exploiting a nationwide natural experiment of income shocks, (ii) imposing a theory-guided covariance structure on the joint dynamics of income and consumption, and (iii) directly using answers to survey questions asking how much households would spend out of hypothetical income shocks. Well-known works in each of the approaches include Johnson et al. (2006) and Parker et al. (2013) for the first approach,==== Blundell et al. (2008) and Kaplan et al. (2014b) for the second one, and Jappelli and Pistaferri (2014) for the third one, among many others. I use the second approach because its data requirements are met by ENAHO.====This paper is also related to the literature estimating MPCs for certain regions and targeted groups of emerging economies using natural experiments or RCTs. For example, Paxson (1992) uses rainfall shocks in rural Thailand and identifies the consumption responses of rice farmers. Haushofer and Shapiro (2016) and Egger et al. (2019) use randomized cash transfers in a small study district within rural Kenya and identify the consumption responses of poor households in the district. My paper complements these studies by estimating MPCs with a semistructural method and, more importantly, using a nationally representative sample.====As noted above, I interpret the MPC estimates through the lens of a standard incomplete-market, life-cycle model. In this aspect, this paper is indebted to a longstanding literature in which many different versions of the model are developed, analyzed, and applied for a variety of topics. Some well-known works in this literature include Carroll (1997), Huggett (1996), Hubbard et al. (1995), and Kaplan and Violante (2010), among many others. The model is used for multiple purposes in this paper. As one of the purposes, I check the performance of the MPC estimator using model simulation in the spirit of Kaplan and Violante (2010).====There is a burgeoning literature examining how microlevel household consumption-saving behavior and its heterogeneity matter for aggregate dynamics, the effects of monetary and fiscal policies, and their transmission mechanisms. Several studies find that these macroeconomic outcomes are significantly affected by high MPCs and correspondingly strong precautionary saving behavior in the U.S. Well-known examples include Krueger et al. (2016), Kaplan et al. (2018), Auclert (2019), Berger et al. (2018), McKay et al. (2016), and Oh and Reis (2012), among many others.====This paper suggests that MPCs and precautionary saving behavior can affect macroeconomic outcomes more significantly in emerging economies than in developed economies. In this regard, this paper supports the importance of recent endeavors to expand the literature to open and emerging economies, such as Auclert et al. (2021b), Guntin et al. (2020), Guo et al. (2020), Zhou (2021), Ferrante and Gornemann (2021), De Ferra et al. (2020), Villalvazo (2021), Oskolkov (2022), and Hong (2020). I expect this paper to contribute to this recent wave of research by providing useful off-the-shelf target moments for the key object, MPC.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the MPC estimation method and the numerical method of solving and simulating the incomplete-market, life-cycle model. Section 3 describes how the data are processed. Section 4 estimates quarterly Peruvian MPCs, calibrates the model to the Peruvian economy using the estimates, evaluates the performance of the MPC estimator in the model, and annualizes the quarterly MPCs using both model-free and model-based methods. Section 5 estimates annual U.S. MPCs, calibrates the model to the U.S. economy using the estimates, and compares Peruvian and U.S. MPCs. Section 6 examines the main driver of the cross-country MPC differences in the model. Section 7 considers several alternative specifications either in the model simulation or in the MPC estimation. Section 8 provides a discussion on external validity.

In this paper we explore whether the form of accumulation affects country risk. We first present a model of endogenous sovereign debt defaults, where we show that reserve accumulation through the issuance of debt contingent on local output reduces spreads in a way that reserve accumulation with foreign borrowing does not. We confirm this model prediction when taking the theory to the data. These results suggest that attention should be placed on the way reserves are accumulated, a distinction that has important practical implications. In particular, our results call into question the benefits of programs of reserves strengthening through external debt such as those typically implemented by multilateral organizations.","There is an extensive literature on the benefits and costs of holding foreign reserves. The benefits associated to reserves can be broadly related to three basic attributes: the role of reserves as a source of liquidity, their role as a hedging mechanism, and as a way to modify the real exchange rate in what has been called the “mercantilistic” motive. The costs of reserves are associated to the financing costs of such reserves: the foreign interest rate if the reserves are borrowed, the domestic interest rate premia if purchased with domestic assets, or their impact on inflation if purchased through unsterilized interventions.====One important motivation for reserves has been that of providing a liquidity reservoir for times of need in which reserves can be used to smooth balance of payments disruptions. Initially the focus was mostly related to disruptions in trade flows (reserves were aimed at covering a given number of months of imports) but more recently have focused on capital flows. This second view was popularized in the so called Greenspan-Guidotti rule, a rule of thumb by which central banks should hold reserves equivalent to the government's short term liabilities (Greenspan, 1999). Jeanne and Ranciere (2011) formalized this idea in a framework that added both a negative output effect of capital flow reversals as well as a positive effect of reserve accumulation on spreads. They find that a model with these ingredients delivers levels of reserves consistent with those observed in most countries. After the great financial crisis many studies showed that reserves allowed countries to face the financial crisis with lower output costs (e.g., Dominguez et al., 2012, and Bussière et al., 2015). Levy-Yeyati (2008) documents the impact of reserves on spreads suggested in Jeanne and Ranciere (2011). As a broad summary of these findings, the IMF in 2011 (see IMF, 2011) proposed a practitioner's guide to estimate optimal reserves where exposure to financial flow reversals (measured as the ratio of short term debt to M2) and trade flows were the main ingredients.====In recent years, this approach has been complemented by the view that reserves may actually not only provide liquidity in times of need, but that they may actually change the equilibrium of the economy. In this line, a recent literature on sovereign debt and reserve accumulation shows how larger holdings of international reserves change the borrowing terms faced by emerging countries and (under certain conditions) reduce equilibrium spreads (see Alfaro and Kanczuk, 2009; Bianchi et al., 2018, and Bianchi and Sosa-Padilla, 2020). Relatedly, the role of reserves for lender-of-last-resort support are discussed in Bocola and Lorenzoni (2017) and Felipe and Chang (2019).====The hedging role of reserves was originally discussed in relation to the currency composition of reserves (see Dellas and Yoo, 1991), but was taken a step further by Caballero and Panageas (2003). Their idea is that the government could aim at ==== its income at times of distress by investing reserves in instruments that correlated negatively with its own shocks. Alfaro and Kanczuk (2019) study the role of domestic liabilities as a way of providing this hedge in a model with reserve accumulation and sovereign default. They find that countries issue domestic debt and accumulate reserves to hedge against negative shocks. Bianchi and Sosa-Padilla (2020) highlight a macro-stabilization ==== role for reserves in a model with default risk and nominal rigidities. Since sovereign risk is countercyclical, low income states will simultaneously show high interest rates and slack in the labor market. Therefore, having reserves reduces the need to roll-over debt maturing at high interest rates and frees up resources to stabilize macro fluctuations (i.e., reduce the slack in the labor market). Bianchi and Sosa-Padilla (2020) label this effect the “macro-stabilization hedging” benefit of issuing debt to buy reserves.==== A practitioner's guide to implement these ideas is discussed in Sturzenegger (2019), and Orazi et al. (2020). In particular Orazi et al. (2020) develop a model of asset allocation for foreign reserves that is chosen in order to correlate negatively with the shocks faced by the economy.====Finally, the mercantilistic approach was an attempt to explain the policy of central banks aimed at avoiding large exchange rate appreciations, a motivation that became prominent during the reserves buildups of the 2000s, and particularly by the presumption that China was accumulating reserves to fight an appreciation of its currency. It was initially suggested in Aizenman and Riera-Crichton (2008), though Aizenman and Lee (2007) argue that on a quantitative dimension, the role of the mercantilist view is dwarfed by other determinants, particularly liquidity.====Other theories highlight the interaction between growth externalities and financial frictions as a rationale for reserve accumulation (Benigno et al., 2021), and as a macroprudential policy tool (Arce et al., 2019).====These different motivations for holding external reserves, in turn, have led to alternative measures of the benefits of these reserves. Rodrik and Velasco (1999) and Rodrik (2006) provide an assessment of the benefits of reserves in terms of avoiding financial crises. They estimate a 10% reduction in the probability of a crisis, which, combined with a 10% drop in output in such events, entails a benefit equivalent to 1% of GDP.==== Rodrik (2006) suggests that such a benefit bodes reasonably well with the spread differentials that countries pay to hold reserves. Levy-Yeyati (2008) argues that, because of the positive effect of reserves on spreads, the cost of holding reserves has been overestimated.====In this literature, two issues have captured less attention than they deserve. First, that it is typically assumed that the central bank's and government's balance sheet are one and the same, even when debt is typically issued by the government and does not constitute central bank debt. The issue of who accumulates reserves may be a relevant issue, particularly if the central bank is independent, but has been largely ignored.====A second issue, which will be the main point discussed here, relates to the way the reserves buildup is financed. In fact, there are three main ways to purchase reserves: by unsterilized purchases, by issuing foreign currency denominated debt, and by issuing debt which may be contingent to local output. Below we will argue that domestic currency denominated debt belongs to the latter category.====It is easy to argue that the way reserves are financed should have a bearing on the effect of reserves. For example, accumulating reserves with foreign currency denominated liabilities provides liquidity but no hedge, where we refer to hedging as a way of generating positive valuation effects (in Alfaro and Kanczuk, 2019's terminology) in times of distress. This differs from the effects of accumulating reserves with state contingent debt which provides both liquidity and hedging benefits.====Accumulating reserves with liabilities entails an interest rate cost known as carry which is another channel through which the mechanism used for accumulation matters. If liabilities are issued in foreign currency the carry comprises the country risk and a time premia, as debt issued to finance reserves typically has a longer maturity than the assets where those resources are parked. This interest rate premia can be thought as the “insurance” cost that pays off in terms of benefits of consumption smoothing when reserves are used, a benefit that, as was mentioned, Jeanne and Ranciere (2011) show justifies the levels of reserves seen in the data.====The same calculation holds when accumulating reserves with state contingent debt, except that the carry needs to compensate for the risk properties of this debt, which provides a higher level of insurance in bad times. This higher level of protection implies that the “insurance” premia is typically (but not necessarily) larger.====Given the practical relevance of these effects it is somewhat surprising that there is a relatively scant literature evaluating the implications of how reserve accumulation is done. This paper will focus on how sovereign spreads are affected by the way reserves are accumulated. We will show, both theoretically and empirically, that the financing mechanism does matter for the level of spreads.====At the theoretical level, our paper builds on Alfaro and Kanczuk (2019) who provide a model where reserves can be accumulated with debt issued in terms of tradables or non-tradables. They assume that both debt and reserves are short-term and so the optimal portfolio is particularly sensitive to roll-over risk. This, in turn, delivers similar levels of reserves and debt, something at odds with the data. While their model underscores that the way reserves are accumulated is a key element in evaluating their value, we generalize their model assuming that ‘domestic debt’ is a financial instrument that pays coupons contingent on the realization of the domestic income, as opposed to modelling debt issued in non-tradable units.==== Moreover, following Bianchi et al. (2018), we use a model with long-term debt and short-term reserves (a better description of the assets used by the governments and central banks), and show that in this case the resulting equilibrium portfolios are closer to the data.====At an empirical level, Levy-Yeyati and Gómez (2020) somewhat address the issue, but only to assess the benefits of leaning-against-the-wind policies. They show that central banks accumulating reserves financed with domestic currency may experience valuations gains if they follow a policy of purchasing to avoid large appreciations while selling at moments of distress. But they do not take the following step to see if this, which reinforces the hedging properties of reserves, leads to lower spreads. We show that it does.====The paper is organized as follows. The next subsection describes a specific case that motivates why this issue is important for policy. In section 2 we present a theoretical framework allowing for alternative ways of accumulating reserves and trace the effect of each one of them on sovereign spreads. A testable implication of our theory is that, for a given level of debt, financing reserve accumulation with contingent debt (in particular, using an instrument indexed to domestic income) allows the country to pay lower spreads than it would otherwise (i.e., had it used non-state contingent debt instead), a channel that becomes more important the larger the macro-vulnerabilities of the country. Section 3 takes the model to the data. We confirm the theoretical predictions both using cross country regressions as well as looking at specific exogenous events. Our results indicate that the source of financing matters. Accumulating reserves with domestic liabilities is beneficial in mitigating country risk, whereas accumulating reserves with foreign liabilities provide no visible benefit. Section 4 provides two robustness checks. We first allow for private sector production and borrowing. We show that the inclusion of the private sector does not affect the results which is robust to whether the private sector uses contingent or non contingent debt. We then test whether our result stand for other measures of crisis risk such as Goldman Sachs' financial conditions index. We show the results also hold for this broader measure. Finally, section 5 concludes and provides a discussion for future work in this area.",Does it matter how central banks accumulate reserves?

The literature tackled them separately: i) strategic complementarities for exporting firms to mitigate the pass-through to consumer prices and ii) ==== shocks, but lowers it in response to private demand shocks, a point which complements the existing literature.","The empirical literature on the Exchange Rate Pass Through to prices (ERPT) consistently finds that an exchange rate depreciation is strongly and rapidly transmitted to import prices and has a much smaller and delayed effect on consumer prices (see Goldberg and Campa, 2010, Burstein and Gopinath, 2014, Colavecchio and Rubene, 2020, or Ortega and Osbat, 2020 among others). We label this evidence the ERPT disconnect. Furthermore, as we will show below, there is at most a weak empirical connection between the trade openness of an economy and the sensitivity of its consumer price inflation to changes in the import prices, a stylized fact which extends the ERPT disconnect into a puzzle for the standard New Keynesian open economy macromodel (NOEM hereafter). Indeed, the canonical NOEM model à la Gali and Monacelli (2005) features only final goods imports. This implies that all imports enter the final goods basket with a weight equal to the ratio of imports to domestic absorption. This straitjacket applies also to the end-user (or consumer for simplicity) price index such that this usual representation suffers two major weaknesses regarding the above mentioned stylized facts. First, even for the least open economies, it does not allow to explain why the pace of transmission of exchange rate variations to end users' prices is slower than to import prices. Second, according to this model, the difference between import price and end-user price ERPTs relies fully on the import-to-absorption ratio, which obviously prevents the canonical model to match the first stylized fact for more open economies, as well as the second stylized fact.====In this paper, we show that Foreign Intermediate Inputs in Production (FIIP) can break the link between trade openness and the weight of imported final goods in the final goods basket, allowing to match the two stylized facts stated above. For a given import-to-absorption ratio, FIIP reduces the weight of imported goods in the final goods basket, and thus the consumption price ERPT, in two ways. Firstly, it diverts imports away from direct domestic demand and into production, of which a share is devoted to exports. Therefore the impact of import price fluctuations is partially channelled into the marginal costs of exporters and export prices. The empirical relevance of FIIP is supported at the macro level by the substantial import content of exports measured in OECD economies. At the firm level, Amiti et al. (2014) confirm that the largest exporters are also the biggest importers. However, re-export is, by far, not the major ERPT mitigating medium for FIIP. Secondly and more importantly, FIIP also reroutes to domestic production imported value added whose ultimate destination remains the domestic final goods basket. If the prices of domestically produced goods are subject to rigidities, this detour attenuates the transmission of import prices fluctuations to the consumption price compared to the standard NOEM model by channelling them partially into the producers' price markup. Using firm level data, Amiti et al. (2019) argue empirically that such markup adjustments are key to explain the low exchange rate pass-through into domestic prices found in the literature. We show that, once embedded in a structural macromodel, this second channel is strongly non-linear and proves to be particularly powerful.====All in all, FIIP allows to cope with two major phenomena linked with globalization and pointed by the pioneering works of Feenstra (1998) and Yi (2003): trade integration and internationalization of the production process. We document this with a third empirical finding, namely that across OECD economies, the import content of exports is strongly positively related to trade openness. From this positive correlation combined with the finding that FIIP attenuates the consumption price ERPT, we infer that FIIP has a strong potential to help the NOEM to generate simultaneously (i) strong and rapid import price ERPT and (ii) low and delayed consumption price ERPT, (iii) even for highly open economies. In this regard, FIIP compares favorably to two other theoretical mechanisms proposed to yield a low ERPT, i.e. nominal rigidities of local currency export prices - as in Smets and Wouters (2002) -, on the one hand, and strategic complementarities faced by local currency pricing exporting firms resulting from their interaction with local distribution services - as in Corsetti and Dedola (2005) or Corsetti et al. (2008)==== -, on the other hand. As we confirm below, these approaches have in common that they reduce the consumption price ERPT relative to the canonical model by, counterfactually, lowering the import price ERPT.====Understanding and reproducing the pass-through of import prices to consumption prices is essential for central banks as the first one is the most volatile component of the second one, which is furthermore their policy target. The difficulty for models to cope with the dynamics of both these series simultanously, in the short and the long run, is illustrated by the fact that Adolfson et al., 2007, Adolfson et al., 2008, a workhorse and pioneering estimated macromodel, does not include import prices within observed variables in the estimation procedure.==== This intrinsic difficulty is also well described and discussed in Burlon et al. (2018) which observe both import and consumption prices inflations. The challenge is, on the one hand, not to over-emphasize the impact of import price on consumption price in the short run, while on the other hand, keep the information they contain for the medium run developments of consumption prices. As explained above, these are exactly two dimensions in which FIIP may help, by limiting the direct transmission from import to consumption prices and redirecting imported inflationary pressures through the production sector from where they will smoothly percolate to the consumer.====Remarkably, the effect of FIIP on the ERPT has not been previously studied in the existing literature, which has instead focused on the impact of FIIP on the cross-country correlation of real activity (see Huang and Liu, 2007, Burstein et al., 2008, and Johnson, 2014). Moreover, we show that the results we derive for the structural pass-through, carry over to the dynamic, general equilibrium effects of a depreciation, which we simulate as an exogenous shock to the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition. An additional insight arising from this currency depreciation simulation is that, with FIIP, the higher the elasticity of substitution between FIIP and domestic value added, the stronger the reaction of the domestic consumption price. Indeed, a greater substitutability increases the expenditure switching effect of a depreciation, and thus the associated increase in GDP and producer prices. This general equilibrium result contradicts the conventional wisdom contained in the - partial equilibrium - reasoning of Goldberg and Campa (2010) that consumption prices are less affected by exchange rates and import price shocks when local firms can more flexibly substitute away from imported components into domestic components in their production mix.====Finally, we examine the impact of distribution services (DIST hereafter) à la Corsetti and Dedola (2005) and FIIP on the model's ability to generate positive cross-country correlations of GDP and inflation, a dimension on which the standard NOEM performs relatively poorly (cf. e.g. Justiniano and Preston, 2010). We find that FIIP entering production in a Leontieff fashion and DIST increase the cross-country correlation of GDP growth in the presence of monetary policy and technology shocks. Indeed, for these shocks GDP and interest rate - and therefore the value of the currency through the UIP condition - move in opposite directions such that the terms-of-trade externality of a Home shock on the Foreign economy tends to offset the aggregate demand externality. Since both the DIST and FIIP mechanisms attenuate the terms-of-trade externality by reducing the expenditure switching effect, it opposes less the aggregate demand effect. By contrast, a private sector demand shock moves GDP and the interest rate in the same direction, implying that the aggregate demand and terms-of-trade externalities re-enforce each other. Therefore, attenuating the terms-of-trade externality tends to reduce the international correlation of GDP growth in this case. Furthermore, for all shocks, FIIP raises the cross-country inflation correlation the most of all the variants of the NOEM considered.====Regarding the impact of FIIP on cross-country correlations, our contribution goes beyond Huang and Liu (2007) in that they discuss only monetary policy shocks, and beyond Burstein et al. (2008) in that they consider an RBC model with technology shocks only. Furthermore, they do not discuss the merits of FIIP regarding ERPTs or the cross-country correlation of consumer price inflation. Finally, we go beyond Corsetti et al. (2008) in that we highlight the relationship between DIST and the expenditure switching effect and discuss the effect of DIST on the international correlation of economic activity and inflation.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some ERPT stylized facts drawn from the literature and complements it with cross-country macro evidence on the ERPT disconnect. Section 3 integrates the DIST and FIIP mechanisms into the canonical two-country NOEM model. We then highlight their respective impact on the composition of the consumption price index (Section 4), the structural exchange rate pass-through (Section 5), and the expenditure switching effect (Section 6). Section 7 analyzes the dynamic, general equilibrium effects of a currency depreciation. Section 8 discusses the impact of FIIP and DIST on the model's ability to generate positive cross-country correlations of real activity and inflation.",Low pass-through and international synchronization in general equilibrium: Reassessing vertical integration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001428,6 December 2022,2022,Research Article,35.0

Although the member countries are subject to a common monetary policy, perceptions of this policy may vary across countries. Heterogenous beliefs about the monetary policy transmission mechanism potentially complicate the communication and implementation of the common monetary policy and may, ultimately, contribute to differences in the transmission mechanisms across the member countries. In fact, several studies document that the transmission of monetary policy is to some degree heterogeneous across the member countries due to differences in e.g. institutional environments and economic structures (e.g. Ciccarelli et al., 2013; Almgren et al., 2022; Corsetti et al., 2022; Mandler et al., 2022). We explore whether beliefs about the monetary transmission mechanism are characterized by similar heterogeneities and provide novel evidence on how consumers update their macroeconomic expectations in response to monetary policy shocks.====We estimate a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) as in e.g. Bernanke et al. (2005), Forni et al. (2009), and Forni and Gambetti (2010) with euro area data. The FAVAR approach allows us to include a large amount of information that is potentially relevant for the monetary transmission mechanism (see e.g. Boivin et al., 2008; Barigozzi et al., 2014; Corsetti et al., 2022). Moreover, we are able to study the dynamics induced by policy shocks in euro area member countries within a unified framework that takes inter-country dependencies into account. Our dataset includes monthly macroeconomic and financial time series as well as survey data obtained from the Joint Harmonized EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys (BCS) of the European Commission for the euro area as a whole and for 11 member countries from 2003 to 2019. We identify euro area monetary policy shocks using high-frequency interest rate surprises that occur within a tight time window around ECB announcements from the Euro Area Monetary Policy Event-Study Database of Altavilla et al. (2019).====Our results suggest that survey respondents generally revise inflation and unemployment expectations in the directions predicted by standard macroeconomic models (see e.g. Smets and Wouters, 2007). Moreover, the responses of consumers' expectations are generally in line with actual macroeconomic dynamics following a monetary policy shock. This is the case for the euro area and for the majority of member countries, despite a certain degree of heterogeneity. In this sense, we conclude that consumers' subjective models are in general aligned with empirical and theoretical models of the monetary transmission mechanism. To the extent that central bank communication increases consumers' understanding of the transmission mechanism,==== our results are consistent with the interpretation that ECB communication is relatively effective in managing and coordinating expectations across countries.====At the country-level, we find that contractionary policy shocks give rise to lower expected price pressure in all countries in our sample and although unemployment expectations respond only weakly or with a negative sign in a few countries, unemployment expectations are revised upward in the majority of countries. In countries where unemployment expectations are adjusted in a way that is at odds with the standard theoretical transmission mechanism, the revisions in expectations are still consistent with the responses of the actual unemployment rates in these countries. Intended major purchases, which we interpret as a proxy for consumption plans, are generally less responsive to policy shocks and exhibit a larger degree of heterogeneity than consumer price and unemployment expectations.====Our analysis is closely related to several contributions that study how consumers interpret monetary policy in the U.S. To characterize consumers' subjective models of the economy, Andre et al., 2022 conduct a survey experiment and show that respondents expect inflation to increase after an unexpected interest rate hike and to decline after a surprise interest rate decrease. In addition, consumers expect the unemployment rate to remain unchanged after an unexpected interest rate decrease. Geiger and Scharler (2021) study observational data from the Michigan Survey and find that consumers revise inflation expectations roughly in line with standard macroeconomic models, while unemployment expectations respond only weakly. Carvalho and Nechio (2014) find that consumers update inflation expectations consistent with a Taylor rule, while this is not the case for unemployment expectations. Apart from methodological differences, we contribute to this literature by studying consumers' perceptions of monetary policy in the euro area and in particular the heterogeneity across the euro area countries. Our findings indicate that consumers' interpretations of the effects of monetary policy in the euro area are, if anything, more in line with theoretical and empirical models of the transmission mechanism than in the U.S., despite the fact that the euro area consists of rather diverse economies.====A number of papers study inflation expectations in the euro area. Łyziak and Paloviita (2017) find that inflation expectations have become less anchored since the 2008 financial crisis. Similarly, Miccoli and Neri (2019) analyze financial market-based measures of inflation expectations and find that inflation expectations responded more strongly to surprise inflation releases during the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis. However, this sensitivity disappeared after the ECB launched its Expanded Asset Purchase Program. Eminidou et al. (2020) show that contractionary ECB announcements reduce inflation expectations of consumers in the euro area only if their information set is well aligned with the ECB's information set. Aßhoff et al. (2021) find that unconventional ECB policy manages to influence inflation expectations at least transitorily. Although our analysis differs in terms of the data, the econometric approach, and our focus on consumers' subjective models of the transmission mechanism, we complement these papers by analyzing macroeconomic expectations more broadly.====Finally, several contributions emphasize heterogeneities in the monetary transmission mechanism in the euro area. From a methodological point of view, the paper closest to ours is Corsetti et al. (2022), who also estimate a FAVAR model and use a high-frequency approach for the identification of monetary policy shocks. In contrast to Corsetti et al. (2022), we take central bank information effects into account and use a Bayesian approach to estimate the model. Barigozzi et al. (2014) use a FAVAR model and impose sign restrictions to identify policy shocks. Both these papers find substantial heterogeneities in the responses of prices and unemployment across euro area member countries. Hachula et al. (2020) use a high-frequency data identification approach and document asymmetric reactions in response to unconventional monetary policy shocks. Almgren et al. (2022) estimate local projection regressions with high-frequency instruments and conclude that liquidity constraints can explain heterogenous output effects. Mandler et al.

They find that GDP declines somewhat less in Spain than in the other countries and that the price level decrease is weakest in Germany. Burriel and Galesi (2018) estimate a global VAR and identify unconventional policy shocks using zero and sign restrictions. They find that the output gains from unconventional policy measures are smaller in countries with weaker banking systems. Heterogenous responses to common monetary shocks are also found in Georgiadis (2015) using a global VAR model. In a panel-VAR setting, Ciccarelli et al.

Our lifecycle model incorporates cross-country differences in fertility and longevity as well as differences in countries' ability to borrow inter-temporally and across generations through social security. In this environment, global aging triggers uphill capital flows from emerging to advanced economies, while country-specific demographic evolutions reallocate capital towards countries aging more slowly. Our quantitative multi-country overlapping generations model explains a large fraction of long-term capital flows across advanced and emerging countries.","The world is aging and is expected to age further, as a result of a secular decline in fertility and mortality rates worldwide. As shown in Fig. 1, these trends have been especially pronounced in emerging countries, which have seen their demographic patterns converge towards those of advanced economies over the last decades. While the world was essentially bi-modal in the 1960s—with a marked contrast between advanced economies and emerging countries in terms of fertility and life expectancy—demographic patterns have become more homogeneous around the globe, as emphasized by Lee (2003) and de Silva and Tenreyro (2017).==== Fig. 1 nonetheless reveals substantial heterogeneity in the timing and pace of demographic evolutions, among emerging countries in particular. While South-East Asia experienced a fast convergence, the rest of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Latin America converged at a slower pace. Sub-Saharan Africa still displays fairly high levels of fertility and mortality, and is projected to gradually converge in the future.====This paper investigates how these broad demographic evolutions, comprising both global and country-specific components, can help explain patterns of capital flows across countries and over time. A distinct feature of our theoretical and quantitative analysis is to incorporate cross-country differences in credit markets and social security—i.e., differences in their ability to make intertemporal and intergenerational transfers. The interactions between demographic evolutions and these dimensions of heterogeneity occupy central stage in our work, and their combination is essential to the quantitative success of the model.====Country-specific demographic evolutions and the global aging trend both contribute in shaping international capital flows. On the one hand, as discussed in the previous literature, demographic heterogeneity generates capital flows towards countries that are younger and are aging more slowly. This force tends to induce ==== flows towards emerging countries—most of which are importing capital in the data. On the other hand, the common trend itself constitutes another driver of capital flows in our setup.==== Specifically, we show that, when countries differ in their ability to borrow over the lifecycle and/or across generations, global aging tends to generate ==== flows towards advanced economies—which typically have more developed credit markets and a wider social security coverage. Our work also demonstrates the quantitative relevance of this second force in matching some features of the data. Indeed, we show that it helps to account for the vast amounts of capital flowing uphill from some emerging countries to advanced economies in the 2000s (Bernanke (2005), Obstfeld and Rogoff (2009)) and to rationalize the limited amounts of capital flowing towards emerging countries.====In the first part of the paper, we articulate our theory of aging and capital flows in a stylized multi-country overlapping generations framework. Three generations coexist in each country: the young borrow against future income; the middle-aged work, contribute to social security, and save for retirement; the elderly consume out of their savings and pension benefits. The ability to borrow and the level of social security contributions/benefits differ across countries and are assumed to be higher in developed countries. Global and country-specific demographic trends are captured by exogenous fertility and probability of surviving into old age.====In this setup, we characterize analytically the impact of fertility and longevity on the interest rate and capital flows. Global aging causes a drop in the world interest rate due to a rise in savings and a decline in investment—even more so when the world average level of social security is low. Uphill capital flows arise as a consequence of a divergence in savings across countries—which is partly driven by their differential response to the interest rate drop. In all countries, the young tend to borrow more thanks to cheaper credit. On the other hand, the middle-aged tend to increase their savings as a result of higher longevity, but this rise is mitigated both by a wealth effect (higher present value of future benefits) and an increase in social security contributions (as the system adjusts to the demographic pressure). Due to easier access to credit and higher levels of social security, the increase in borrowing by the young and the forces that mitigate the rise in middle-aged's savings are stronger in advanced economies—which thus experience a deterioration in their net foreign asset positions. The divergence in savings and the resulting uphill capital flows are reinforced when the decline in the interest rate is more pronounced, and when the financing of social security in advanced economies adjusts to population aging mostly through higher contribution rates, rather than lower benefits.====We also analyze how country-specific demographic factors affect capital flows in our setup. Among emerging countries, differences in the timing of demographic evolutions lead to markedly different outcomes in terms of capital flows. Countries that experience an early convergence quickly start to export capital—possibly as soon as they open up. In contrast, countries with a delayed convergence are more likely to experience capital inflows. Hence, younger developing countries with more vibrant demographics may experience capital inflows, while emerging economies that age fast export capital. More broadly, the model predicts that rich patterns of capital flows may emerge—shaped by differences in demographics and aging prospects, but also by the interactions between the worldwide aging trend and heterogeneity in credit markets and social security.====In the second part of the paper, we consider a quantitative version of the model and confront its predictions on capital flows to the data. In the quantitative setup, all features of cross-country heterogeneity are preserved, but agents live for many periods, with some probability of dying in each period. Considering a sample of 70 countries that covers all regions of the globe and more than 90% of world GDP, we calibrate fertility and mortality rates to the data for each country. Using household debt data and processing a vast amount of information on social security systems across the world, we also calibrate the level of credit market development in each country, as well as the generosity of their public pension schemes. Keeping all countries on the same productivity growth path to isolate the role of demographics, we simulate the dynamics of the world economy assuming complete autarky until 1980, when world capital markets integrate.====Our calibrated model broadly reproduces the salient patterns of capital flows across countries over the last decades. Upon opening in the 1980s, capital flows are relatively modest despite massive demographic differences across countries, and capital tends to flow from Western Continental Europe and Japan towards younger regions. Because they have relatively young populations, most emerging countries initially import capital—although much less than a model with symmetric credit constraints and social security would predict. Over time, as some emerging countries (e.g., South-East Asia) are aging faster than the rest of the world, they turn into creditors and replace Continental Europe and Japan as major world lenders—a phenomenon reinforced by the fall in the world interest rate induced by global aging. Meanwhile, countries with a delayed demographic transition (Sub-Saharan Africa and, to a lesser extent, South and Central Asia) become large debtors. Among advanced economies, global aging accentuates the position of Anglo-Saxon countries as large debtors, while bringing Old Europe and Japan closer to balance. Simulations suggest that such trends should perpetuate in the future, with an even larger fraction of emerging countries turning into creditors.====To systematically assess the quantitative performance of the model, we regress capital flows as observed in current account data over the period 1990–2015 on model-predicted flows. The model explains a substantial fraction of the dispersion in capital flows across countries, accounting for 30–40% of the cross-country variation in the data—with a slope coefficient that is close to unity. Thus, although it naturally misses some of the time-series variations, for instance due to financial crises and business cycle fluctuations, the model captures remarkably well the direction and level of capital flows for a large cross-section of countries. Counterfactual experiments show that the global aging trend and cross-country differences in demographics are both essential to the model's performance. While the latter tend to foster capital flows towards countries that are aging more slowly, the former—interacted with heterogeneous credit constraints and social security—helps bring the model in line with the data by limiting the magnitude of downhill flows towards younger developing economies, and by generating some uphill flows towards advanced economies. As a by-product of our quantitative analysis, we also assess the ability of global demographic changes to explain the sustained decline in the world interest rate and find that our model accounts for almost half of the fall observed since 1990.====This paper contributes to an extensive literature on the economic implications of aging. First and foremost, our analysis relates to earlier studies exploring the impact of demographic evolutions on capital flows—including Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996), Brooks (2003), Feroli (2003), Ferrero (2010), Choukhmane (2012), and Backus et al. (2014). In that vein, our paper is most closely related to Domeij and Flodén (2006), who focus on OECD countries over the period 1960–2002. While our quantitative setup and methodology are largely inspired by theirs, we view our contribution as twofold. First, we show that a common demographic trend on its own can trigger capital flows when countries are heterogeneous in the development of their credit markets and social security systems. Second, we assess the empirical relevance of this novel mechanism by incorporating a large set of emerging/developing countries in our study. This is crucial for the quantitative success of our story, as the inclusion of these countries implies a larger cross-country dispersion in the development of credit markets and in the generosity of social security.==== Our work also relates to a second strand of recent papers that assess the extent to which demographic factors can explain the secular fall in real interest rates. Carvalho et al. (2016), Eggertsson et al. (2017), Gagnon et al. (2016), and Lisack et al. (2017) develop their analysis in the context of a closed advanced economy. Our paper is more closely related to Krueger and Ludwig (2007), who investigate the impact of aging on the future evolution of factor prices in an open-economy setting, focusing on OECD countries. Instead, we include an extensive set of emerging economies in our quantitative exploration.==== These countries, which constitute a substantial fraction of the world economy, have typically aged later but faster than advanced economies, and also tend to have less generous social security systems. Our findings indicate that their presence reinforces the decline in interest rates in the most recent period. Lastly, our work connects to the vast literature on aging and pension reforms, which typically adopts an OLG modelling approach similar to ours. Whereas a majority of papers set up their analysis in a closed-economy framework, Attanasio et al. (2007), Borsch-Supan et al. (2006), and Fehr et al. (2007) study social security adjustments to aging in an open economy, focusing on the implications for factor prices and welfare across generations and countries. Instead, we focus on aging and capital flows and provide an assessment of our model's predictions using current account data—under various assumptions about how pension systems adjust to the aging pressure.====From a theoretical perspective, our analysis also contributes to a large body of work that investigates the mechanisms driving global imbalances and uphill capital flows—as surveyed in Gourinchas and Rey (2014).==== Our paper emphasizes the role of global aging as a potential source of capital flows from emerging countries to advanced economies, providing a novel mechanism complementary to the ones previously offered in the literature. Lastly, our work is related to the empirical literature on the medium-run determinants of the current account.==== Unlike prior studies, we rely on a quantitative model to construct a theory-grounded predictor of capital flows, which we use in our regression-based assessment of the role of demographics as a driver of capital flows.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a tractable model of aging and capital flows, and elucidates the mechanisms at play. In particular, the analysis sheds light on some general equilibrium effects that operate in our quantitative simulations. Section 3 presents the quantitative model and its calibration to the data, and evaluates its ability to account for the patterns of capital flows observed across the world over the last decades.

We find that tariff and migration policies jointly accounted for 30% of China's export growth. We also find evidence that suggests a positive interaction effect of tariff and migration policies. As migration reform prepared the country to become more export oriented, China enjoyed faster export growth after opening to trade than it would have otherwise.","From 1980 to 2005, the share of global trade of “Made in China” goods grew from 0.8% to 13%. While a large number of literature has focused on the consequences of China's export surge (see Autor et al., 2016, for a review), fewer papers have examined the sources causing China's export surge. In this paper, we jointly analyze several factors and quantify their relative contributions to China's export surge.====We build a multi-sector spatial general equilibrium model and combine rich data sources, to account for China's export surge between 1990 and 2005 from three policy changes: China's import tariffs, tariffs imposed against China's exports, and barriers to internal migration in China. In the model, workers choose which provinces and sectors to work in. Firms choose where to produce and whether to involve in processing or ordinary export regimes.==== We explore provincial and sectoral variation on the changes in firm mass, migrant employment, and tariff exposure to discipline the model parameters. Finally, we jointly analyze the effect of tariff and migration policies on China's export surge, as well as the importance of equilibrium firm and worker adjustments.====Recent literature emphasizes that China's rural-to-urban migrants caused a substantial aggregate output gain (Tombe and Zhu, 2019; Hao et al., 2020). We document that migrant employment was prominent in export-intensive and possessing-oriented industries, improving China's aggregate export/output ratio. As migration policy reform prepared the country to become more export oriented, China enjoyed faster export growth after opening to trade than it would have otherwise. Through the lens of our model, we find that tariff and migration policies jointly accounted for 30% of China's export growth. These joint effects are larger than simply aggregating the effects of each individual policy, suggesting a positive interaction effect of tariff and migration policies.====Accompanied with China's substantial reductions in tariffs and internal migration costs was the massive entry of new firms (Brandt et al., 2012) and the structure changes in export regimes (Brandt and Morrow, 2017). To motivate our quantitative model, we show, using reduced-form specifications, that firm location and regime decisions are sensitive to migration and tariff changes. First, we show that provinces and sectors that experienced larger rises in migrant employment also faced faster increases in the number of firms between 1990 and 2005. To address the endogeneity issues, we construct a Card-type instrument for changes in migrant employment by exploiting historical patterns of location and sector sorting for workers from different provinces of origin. Second, we explore variation across sectors to show that the decreased import tariffs led to a rise in the relative number of ordinary firms to processing firms.==== We use provincial import penetration and sectoral input-output table to construct changes in production costs resulting from import tariff reductions (WTO), and instrument potentially endogenous tariff changes with maximum tariff levels under the WTO agreement following Brandt et al. (2017). These reduced-form estimates will be targeted to discipline the key parameters that govern firm adjustments.====Our model has three key components. First, we build upon Arkolakis et al. (2018) (ARRY hereafter) to model firm location and ordinary and processing regime choices, with correlated productivity draws from a multivariate Pareto distribution (Arkolakis et al., 2016). The second is the inter-sectoral input-output linkages (Caliendo and Parro, 2015). Third, Chinese workers with heterogeneous location preferences and migration costs sort into provinces and sectors. A policy shock could impact the aggregate exports not only by affecting firms' decision on whether and how much to export (Chaney, 2008), but also by changing firms' decision on where to produce and their processing or ordinary regime choice. The aggregate trade elasticity, therefore, depends on the two structural parameters of productivity correlation across locations and across regimes, which, respectively, govern firm location and regime responses to policy shocks.====We use an indirect inference approach to discipline these productivity correlation parameters that match our reduced-form estimates on firm location and regime responses. Specifically, we obtain the productivity correlation across locations to target our reduced-form estimate on the response of the number of firms to migration shocks; and we obtain the productivity correlation between ordinary and processing regimes to target our reduced-form estimate on the effects of import tariff changes on the relative number of ordinary to processing firms. We provide additional evidence that shows each correlation parameter is indeed identified from the associated firm adjustment, but is insensitive to changes in other model components.====We combine detailed transaction-level customs data, firm-level data, international and intranational trade data, and micro-level population census data to account for China's export surge due to the three policy changes mentioned above. We measure the changes in internal migration costs following Head and Ries (2001)’s approach to match the changes in migration flows, and take tariff and migration shocks into a model of 29 sectors, 2 export regimes (processing and ordinary), 30 Chinese provinces, and 35 foreign countries. First, taking individual policy into the model one at a time, we find the reductions in China's import tariffs explained 12.6%, whereas changes in foreign tariffs on China's exports and reductions in internal migration barriers each accounted for 7.7% and 7.2%, respectively. The major portion of China's export growth arose from three coastal provinces (Guangdong, Shanghai, and Jiangsu). We also find that import tariff reductions favored ordinary exports, whereas the reductions in migration barriers and in foreign tariffs on China's exports both favored processing exports.====Next, simultaneously incorporating three policy changes in the model, we find that they jointly accounted for 30% of China's export growth. This joint effect is 9% larger than the aggregation of individual effects (12.6% + 7.7% + 7.2% = 27.5%), which suggests a positive interaction between trade and migration policies. The positive interaction effects we find may arise from three sources: (1) migrants accounted for a higher employment share in export-oriented provinces and sectors; even if migration cost changes were common across all provinces and sectors, employment would still expand more in export-oriented provinces and sectors, generating the positive interaction effects; (2) migration costs decreased more in export-oriented provinces, and thus geography also matters; and (3) migration costs were reduced more in export-oriented industries.==== In evaluating the strength of each mechanism, we find that the first mechanism— the observed higher employment share in export-oriented provinces and sectors— is the main driver of the positive interaction effect.====In our final exercise, we study the role of firm and worker adjustments in China's export growth. We find that, in a model where firms' location and regime do not respond to policy changes, the joint effects of policies on export growth drop by nearly half; and in a model where workers do not adjust across locations or sectors, the export impacts of tariffs drop by 12%. Accounting for equilibrium adjustments of workers and firms is quantitatively important for evaluating China's export growth.====China experienced fast productivity growth in recent decades (Song et al., 2011), and the decline of trade barriers and China's WTO accession had a significant contribution to China's productivity growth (Yu, 2015; Brandt et al., 2017) and the export structures (Brandt and Morrow, 2017). Brandt et al. (2019) build an Eaton-Kortum model with ordinary and processing regimes to quantify the welfare losses of restricting processing output from selling domestically. Differing from these studies, we analyze migration and trade jointly, and show the policy interaction would have been missing if analyzing one policy at a time. Tombe and Zhu (2019), Fan (2019), Ma and Tang (2020) and Zi (2020) model migration and trade jointly in China's context. Our main departure is to distinguish processing and ordinary export regimes, and show the policy interaction is only present for processing export growth. Finally, Brandt and Lim (2019) account for China's export growth. Our approach differs from theirs in two main aspects. First, they focus on changes in productivity, demand, and labor and firm-entry costs between 2000 and 2013, whereas we jointly study migration and tariff policies. Second, they calibrate their model to analyze the evolution of China's export growth. We focus on China's export growth between 1990 and 2005 and use empirical estimates to discipline the degree of firm adjustments to barrier reductions.====Our paper also relates to the quantitative trade and spatial equilibrium literature that studies the impact of goods and labor market integration (Allen and Arkolakis, 2014; Redding and Rossi-Hansberg, 2017, among others). International trade theory has widely emphasized how opening to trade would cause factor relocation and the associated consequences on productivity (Melitz, 2003), yet the labor mobility in China used to be banned. In a well-studied area, researchers have shown that reducing the internal migration frictions can generate sizable aggregate output gains in developing countries (Bryan and Morten, 2019; Tombe and Zhu, 2019). Relatively less attention has been paid to the migrants' choices into detailed sectors and the associated impacts on exports. We argue that China's internal migration expanded the employment size in export-intensive industries, making China more export oriented. We also find that the interaction effect arose entirely from processing export growth but was absent for ordinary exports. These mechanisms would have been missing if migration and tariff policies were analyzed separately, or if processing and ordinary exports were not distinguished in the model.====Finally, by modeling firm location choices, our paper also relates to quantitative research on the production location choices of multinational firms (Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare, 2013; Tintelnot, 2017; Arkolakis et al., 2018). Alviarez (2019) finds that omitting the sectoral allocation of multinational production leads to understate the gains from multinational production and trade openness. We apply this framework to show that firm location choice is important for driving the export impact of China's policy changes.====This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents facts to motivate our analysis; Section 3 presents our model; Section 4 calibrates the model parameters and Section 5 presents the quantitative results.

This result tends to apply if product differentiation is high and the size of the patented cost-reducing innovation is large.,"There is increasing concern in the United States about intellectual property (IP) theft by foreign parties, both foreign firms and foreign governments. Sometimes the federal government becomes directly involved but more commonly legal action is left to the IP owner. Large technology-intensive companies such as Apple and Google (Alphabet) are engaged in IP litigation on an essentially constant basis. This paper addresses the implications of IP litigation for protection from patent-infringing imports.====When domestic IP is infringed by imports, two major types of relief are typically available: fee-based relief or injunctive relief. In the United States, the type of relief depends mainly on where the IP claim is filed. Claims may be filed in federal district court, where relief is normally in the form of license fees.==== Alternatively, claims against imports may be filed before the “quasi-judicial” International Trade Commission (ITC). The remedy used by the ITC is an injunction that prohibits imports using the infringed IP. The ITC has become an important venue for IP cases, which are now arguably more important in economic terms than other types of ITC-administered trade policy such as anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties.====However, despite the significant role played by the ITC in IP cases, only a small fraction of cases eligible for the ITC are filed in that venue. The vast majority of cases are filed in U.S. federal district courts (“court” from now on). Over the 10-year period of 2012 through 2021, there were 982 patent cases filed before the ITC. This compares with 51,728 patent cases filed in court—>50 times as many.==== Part of the growth of court cases relates to standard essential patents (SEPs), as described in, for example, Lerner and Tirole (2015). And many cases filed in court deal with domestically produced goods and are therefore not eligible for the ITC. However, a significant fraction of court cases do deal with imported goods and do not involve SEPs. Yet the vast majority of plaintiffs choose the court system rather than the ITC.====This fact is particularly puzzling as, on the surface, the ITC seems to provide more import protection than the courts. With a court-imposed license fee, imports can still be sold in the domestic market, whereas injunctive relief at the ITC normally excludes imports entirely. Furthermore, as we document more fully in the next section, the factors commonly emphasized as important for venue selection within the court system would seem to favor the ITC as a venue for patent infringement cases. Another significant fact is that both at the ITC and in court, negotiation between the parties is important and many cases are settled before final legal adjudication. The 337Info and FJC databases cited in footnote 2 show that about a third of the ITC cases are settled and >80% of court cases are settled. And, in both venues, license fees are the normal outcome of negotiated settlements.====In this paper, we argue that the incentive for plaintiffs to earn royalty revenue from imports can partially explain the large number of court filings and the prevalence of settlements. Our analysis shows that plaintiff firms normally prefer the foreign firm to be in the market paying a royalty or license fee rather than excluding imports though an injunction. In our model, this is always true if products are differentiated. The final and most surprising step in the argument is that the royalty obtainable through bargaining in court may be better for the plaintiff firm than the royalty obtainable by bargaining under the ITC regime.====We develop the implications of an ITC versus a court filing for protection from patent-infringing imports using a standard differentiated-product duopoly model with Cournot competition. Details differ, but as we show in an extension section and supplementary appendix, consideration of Bertrand competition does not fundamentally change the nature of the results. Nash bargaining is used to model the potential for negotiated settlements. We address two main research questions. First, we ask if and when the ITC would provide more import protection than the courts in the sense that an ITC case results in lower import levels. Second, we ask whether and when plaintiff firms would prefer to file claims in court rather than before the ITC. We also seek to explain the incentives underlying the common use of negotiated settlements.====We consider the case in which the infringed innovation reduces marginal cost and adjudication by the court takes the form of a per-unit license fee or royalty applied to infringing imports. In our base model, the default royalty imposed by the court equals the value of the innovation as measured by its effect in reducing the foreign firm's marginal cost. Also, firms engage in Nash bargaining over a royalty to reach a settlement. Our choice of the default royalty and the effects of fixed license fees in Nash bargaining are considered in an extension section. However, as noted by Kamien (2002, p. 345) and others, some form of output-based payment or royalty is much more common than fixed license fees. The main reasons include risk aversion, liquidity constraints, and informational asymmetries. We also briefly discuss product-enhancing innovation rather than cost-reducing innovation and other possible extensions to the base model.====The answers to our research questions depend on two primary considerations. One consideration is the degree of differentiation between domestic and imported products. The other is the “size” or value of the infringed innovation as measured by whether the innovation is “incremental” or “drastic” in the sense of Arrow (1962). The domestic firm faces two conflicting incentives, namely to reduce competition from infringing imports and to earn royalties from those same imports.==== If the products are perfect substitutes then the competitive effect dominates, as the best possible outcome for the domestic firm is to be a monopoly. But if products are even slightly differentiated, we show that the outcome at the ITC is a settlement with a royalty that allows some imports. For court cases, the outcome for almost all incremental innovations is an adjudicated royalty equal to the value of the innovation. For drastic innovations, the royalty negotiated in either venue is less than the value of the innovation and therefore provides the foreign firm with a net benefit from infringement.====Greater product differentiation always reduces the negotiated royalty in ITC cases and hence reduces the import protection provided by the ITC. For small incremental innovations, an ITC filing does result in greater protection from imports than in court. However, for larger incremental innovations, sufficiently high product differentiation reverses this result − court cases provide a higher level of protection than ITC cases, even thought the ITC uses import prohibitions. For drastic innovations, it is never the case that a filing at the ITC provides more protection from imports than the courts.====The current paper builds on Brander and Spencer (2021), who also compare injunctive with fee-based relief for patent infringement allowing for settlements based on Nash bargaining. The setting in that paper is purely domestic as a monopoly firm infringes a patent held by a patent assertion entity (PAE). The PAE produces no output so the infringing firm has no competitive effect. Product differentiation does not arise.====Section 2 contains a short literature review. Section 3 presents the basic model structure, section 4 describes the final-stage output game and section 5 concerns homogeneous products. For differentiated products, section 6 addresses the Nash bargaining outcomes from an ITC or court filing. Section 7 examines the decision by the domestic firm as to where to file its claim.

Furthermore, devaluation could be used as a tool to mitigate the impact of sovereign default, a point made in the theoretical literature as early as Calvo (1988) and more recently by Na et al. (2018).====Typically, such risks arise in the context of emerging economies. Local currency (LC) bonds issued by these countries are the ideal source of information about the Twin Ds. First, LC bond prices are informative about the issuers' credit risk and how this risk is valued in the marketplace. Second, a U.S. dollar (USD) investor who holds LC bonds is exposed to both credit and exchange rate risks. Thus, combining LC and USD bonds isolates the interaction between the two risks, that is the Twin Ds.====The availability of LC debt is a relatively recent phenomenon. Du and Schreger (2016) emphasize the steady growth of LC debt issued by emerging economies since the early 2000s accompanied by a decline in the debt issued in foreign currency. Among all the regions, the Asia-Pacific (AP) boasts the most evolved LC debt markets. In part spurred by policy initiatives in response to the 1997–98 Asian crisis, local currency government bond markets have grown from less than a quarter of a trillion USD in 1995 (or 10% of GDP) to $10.1 trillion in 2018 (corresponding to 48.5% of GDP).====That is in contrast to, for example, many Latin American countries, where insufficient macroeconomic stability has hampered the growth of local currency bond markets. As a result, the amount of outstanding Latin American LC bonds has barely increased over the past decade. There was a total of $917 billion in 2018, compared to $808 billion in 2005.====The focus on the AP region offers another point of departure from the traditional analysis of sovereign credit risk. Usually, it is studied in reference to “global” variables, which means the United States in practice. In Asia, however, China potentially provides another anchor in addition to the U.S., given its size and its economic significance for the region and the world. In 2017, China's GDP based on PPP valuation exceeded that of the U.S. ($23.1 trillion vs. $19.4 trillion), and its share of global GDP had risen from 2.3% in 1980 to more than 18% in 2017. Moreover, the Chinese government bond market, which was virtually nonexistent in 1980, had by 2019 grown beyond $7 trillion in outstanding bonds. Lastly, as Farhi and Maggiori (2019) emphasize, China is emerging as a challenger to the dominance of the U.S. dollar both in the International Monetary System and in the International Price System. Thus, we investigate the impact of macroeconomic and bond market developments of these two countries on local bond markets in Asia.====We address the questions raised above by studying the behavior of bond yields, both LC and USD, of four AP economies with active LC markets: Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. We find strong evidence of the Twin Ds effect outside of distress via impulse responses: both AP and Chinese credit risk variables affect depreciation rates, and vice versa. The Twin Ds risk premiums are large even during expansions. They range between a half and two times the U.S. bond risk premiums, depending on maturity. The risk-return trade-off from exposure to the Twin Ds risk is attractive as investing in LC debt more than doubles the maximum Sharpe ratio as compared to investment in global bonds only.====As the initial step of our analysis, we model the joint dynamics of macroeconomic and financial factors proposed as yield curve determinants in the literature. Both types of factors are represented by global variables, that is, U.S. and Chinese, and local variables, that is from the four AP economies. This approach serves two purposes. First, we can account for interactions between these factors as they affect sovereign credit spreads. Second, we can characterize not only the contemporaneous but also the multi-horizon role of these variables.====This approach is a departure from existing empirical frameworks. Most studies consider regressions of credit spreads on possible local and global drivers. That limits the analysis to contemporaneous relationships only. Furthermore, it does not account for interactions between variables. Last but not least, the choice of potential determinants is not tightly connected to a bond valuation framework.====Despite their relative macroeconomic stability, the selected countries do vary to some extent in terms of monetary policy, exchange rate stabilization policy, credit quality and tightness of capital controls. This is in contrast to the traditional analysis of bond markets in large advanced economies, which share a lot of similarities across all of these dimensions. Such cross-country differences among AP countries complicate the analysis of the factors driving bond yields in these countries. Another complication arises from the relatively short time span of most AP bond markets. This deprives researchers of rich time series evidence that is enjoyed by those that analyze bond markets in developed economies, such as the United States.====We address both complications in one unifying framework by modeling state variables via a panel vector autoregression (VAR) with country-specific fixed effects. That is, we assume identical responses of local state variables to themselves or to US/Chinese counterparts. That same commonality allows us to establish time-series, or predictability patterns, while exploiting cross-sectional information.====As a next step of our analysis, we take advantage of the rich term structure of yields in our dataset to study risk premiums associated with sovereign credit risk. To that end, we complement the VAR with a stochastic discount factor (SDF) thereby delivering pricing implications for bonds. In turn, this allows us to estimate market prices of various types of risk. One implication of this analysis is that we can infer the maximum Sharpe ratios associated with trading global bonds only, or trading global and local bonds. The difference between the two allows us to gauge the economic significance of AP bond markets for global investors.====We find that local variables play an important quantitative role for the state dynamics. Variance decompositions show that local shocks explain from 42 to 95% of the variation in local state variables, depending on the variable and the country. In particular, local variables explain 91%, 92%, 42%, and 43% of the variation in sovereign credit spreads for Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, respectively. Local output, however, has no significant impact on credit spreads at any horizon. The Twin Ds effect is manifested by the significant impact of the local credit factor on the local depreciation rate and vice versa. Investment in AP LC bonds primarily offers exposure to regional undiversifiable credit risk. In contrast to USD bonds, the additional credit exposure is via the Twin Ds effect. This exposure is richly compensated even outside of default episodes. Maximum Sharpe ratios, which capture the risk-return trade-off, more than double if one invests in AP LC bonds in addition to the global ones. The local variables contribute substantially to the variation in local bond risk premiums, with contributions ranging between 43% and 92%, depending on maturity and country. That these risk premiums depend on local variables is a manifestation of local time-varying risk bearing capacity.",Sovereign credit and exchange rate risks: Evidence from Asia-Pacific local currency bonds,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001246,14 November 2022,2022,Research Article,40.0

We revisit this long-standing ,"Entering foreign markets is costly for firms in terms of information and adaptation costs (Roberts and Tybout, 1997). Empirical evidence shows that firms' decision to serve new foreign markets depends on their prior export experience. Firms' new export destinations tend to be similar to their previous export destinations in terms of culture and geography. Such path dependence of firms' export patterns can be explained by lower export entry costs for firms that previously exported to similar markets. This effect has been called “extended gravity”, since export decisions are not only based on the proximity between the origin and destination countries, but also between past and subsequent destinations (Morales et al., 2019). Studies have shown that firms exhibit export patterns consistent with extended gravity, or that firms are “spatial exporters”, i.e. they are more likely to serve new markets that are geographically close or similar — in terms of language, colonial history, or per capita income — to their prior export destinations (Defever et al., 2015).====In this paper, we explore another form of cross-country similarity that can affect firms' entry costs to foreign markets: regional trade agreements (RTAs). The conventional view is that RTAs, by lowering tariffs between members, increase trade policy discrimination faced by firms in third countries leading to a contraction in their exports at the expense of less efficient producers in member countries (trade diversion). However, modern RTAs often go beyond traditional trade policy, covering behind-the-border policy areas such as domestic regulations. “Deep” trade agreements can make member countries more “similar” in terms of the regulatory environment, thus reducing entry costs and increasing exports of firms in third countries -what some have called ==== trade diversion (Baldwin, 2014). For example, by harmonizing product and technical standards, a deep trade agreement can generate economies of scale for firms that need to comply with one set of standards to reach multiple destinations. Ultimately, the impact on third-country firms of RTAs is an empirical question that in part depends on the content of these agreements.====Using firm-level data from Costa Rica for the period between 1998 and 2012, we estimate the effect of RTAs, of which Costa Rica was not a member, on its exports to member countries.==== The empirical strategy exploits the detailed information on RTAs between destination markets, which are exogenous to Costa Rican firms.==== Our specification captures the non-member benefits of RTAs that work through the reduction in entry costs, that is, at the extensive margin. The channel identified in this study is the marginal effect of exporters' prior export experience in other destination markets that become linked through RTAs. Specifically, we test whether firms are more likely to export to new destinations if they previously exported to another country with which the new destination has an RTA. The multi-dimensional set of fixed effects allows us to identify the coefficient of interest by comparing exports, for a given firm in a given year, to destinations that have an RTA with another country to which the firm has previously exported, and exports to other destinations. The estimated impact is net of any potential firm-destination or destination-year confounding factor. Furthermore, we include spatial control variables that capture the similarity of the export destination to firms' previous export markets in terms of common border, language and colonial history. These are important control variables that have been documented to affect both firms' destination-specific sunk costs and the probability of destinations to be in a deep trade agreement (Albornoz et al., 2012; Defever et al., 2015; Lawless, 2013; Morales et al., 2019).====Results of the firm-level analysis show that firms are more likely to export or start exporting to a new destination market if they previously exported to the destination's RTA partner. This positive spillover effect increases with the depth of the agreement, as measured by the number of strictly enforceable policy areas (i.e. those subject to dispute settlement) covered by the RTA. In fact, we find that the positive effect on Costa Rican exporters is driven by the inclusion of nondiscriminatory policy areas such as subsidies and competition that, by nature, cannot be applied differently on exporters from member and non-member countries. In addition, the impact is larger for RTAs that include regulatory provisions, such as those in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) chapters, which often lead to regulatory convergence between the member countries. The evidence of a positive spillover effect corroborates the view that deep trade agreements can lead to a negative trade diversion.====To further pin down the mechanism, we then exploit the product-level variation in regulation intensity to identify the sources of the positive spillover effects. Intuitively, regulatory convergence implied by deep RTAs is expected to reduce adaptation and entry costs, particularly for firms exporting regulation-intensive products. We proxy regulation-intensive products as those for which WTO members raised Specific Trade Concerns (STC) at the WTO SPS or TBT committees. This proxy allows to capture the importance of regulatory standards at the HS-4 product level, as perceived by the exporters. Results indeed show that the positive spillover effects of deep trade agreements between destination markets are driven by products that are subject to stricter regulations. The positive effect increases for firms exporting regulation-intensive products to destination countries that have a deep trade agreement with one of their prior export markets. This novel finding provides further support to the hypothesis that deep RTAs contribute to a more uniform regulatory environment in member countries, thus making it less costly for non-member country exporters with previous experience in one of the markets to export to a new market.====This paper builds on and contributes to several strands of the literature. First, it builds on the extended gravity, spatial exporters, and sequential exporting literature. This group of studies highlights the importance of firms' experience in previous export markets as a mechanism to learn about new markets and reduce their export sunk costs. Learning can be with regard to a firm's self-discovery of its “export profitability” which is correlated across destinations (Albornoz et al., 2012), through firm networks (Chaney, 2014), or about costly product adaptation processes specific to destination markets (Morales et al., 2019). Through these channels, firms' export sunk costs to new markets depend on their prior export destinations, which can explain the observed spatial correlations in exporting (Defever et al., 2015; Evenett and Venables, 2002; Lawless, 2009, Lawless, 2013; Meinen, 2015; Morales et al., 2019).==== While spatial correlation — based on geographic, linguistic, and cultural proximity — in export entry has been well-documented, the literature has not yet explored the extended gravity effects due to “proximity” in trade-related institutions. Using insights from this literature, we fill this gap by investigating the role of regional trade agreements, and firms' prior export experiences to member countries, on export decisions by firms in third countries.====Second, the paper contributes to the literature on the effects of trade agreements on non-member countries. While much research has demonstrated the benefits of RTAs on member countries, there is less evidence on their impact on non-members.==== Recent research shows that tariff preferences have a negative impact on imports from non-member countries (e.g. Dai et al., 2014; Fugazza and Nicita, 2013; Limão, 2016; Romalis, 2007), especially if these preferences are coupled with strict rules of origin (Conconi et al., 2018).==== It has been shown that tariff erosion can be a factor behind the multiplication of RTAs (Baldwin and Jaimovich, 2012; Chen and Joshi, 2010). In contrast, Mattoo et al. (2017) analyze the content of trade agreements and find that some provisions included in deep agreements have a public good aspect, as they increase trade also with non-members. This paper provides firm-level evidence on the positive spillover effects of deep trade agreements on firms' entry and export decisions.====Finally, the paper is related to the literature on the effect of non-tariff measures and regulatory cooperation on trade (Ederington and Ruta, 2016). Previous contributions analyzed the direct impact of regulations on bilateral trade (Baldwin, 2000; Fernandes et al., 2017; Fontagné et al., 2015) and on trade with third countries (Chen and Mattoo, 2008; Disdier et al., 2015; Fontagné and Orefice, 2018).==== In particular, Chen and Mattoo (2008) study the effects of harmonization and mutual recognition of standards on third countries as well as participating countries. They find that third countries can benefit, depending on the stringency of the harmonized standards and the restrictiveness of the rules of origin. We contribute to this literature by identifying, through a firm-level analysis, regulatory convergence in deep trade agreements (and, specifically, the presence of SPS and TBT provisions in RTAs) as a source of spillover effect.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the data and provides some descriptive statistics. Section 3 presents the empirical specification and results for the firm-level analysis.

According to Mundell's trilemma (Mundell, 1963; Obstfeld et al., 2005), central banks in EMs can control domestic monetary conditions and ensure macroeconomic stability provided that the exchange rate is flexible. However, academics and policymakers have expressed growing skepticism against this view. The influential work of Rey, 2013, Rey, 2016 has showed that the global financial cycle also transmits to countries with flexible exchange rates, affecting credit aggregates and lending spreads. Similarly, various papers have documented that a tightening in international monetary and financial conditions tends to have contractionary effects in EMs, drying up liquidity and increasing borrowing costs (Bruno and Shin, 2015; Dedola et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2017; Iacoviello and Navarro, 2019; Bräuning and Ivashina, 2020; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2020; Kalemli-Özcan, 2019).====To capture the vulnerabilities of EMs to global financial conditions, new models have been developed in which monetary authorities face trade-offs between competing objectives (Obstfeld, 2015).==== Yet in these models monetary easing remains expansionary. Therefore, as discussed in Gourinchas (2018), the implications of the trilemma are largely validated. First, monetary policy retains full control of domestic aggregate demand if the exchange rate is flexible. This is consistent with Mundell (1963)’s argument that monetary policy becomes ineffective under free capital mobility only if the exchange rate is fixed. Second, EMs should still respond to a tightening in global financial conditions in line with the trilemma, by easing monetary policy and letting the exchange rate depreciate.====However, the empirical evidence suggests that EMs tend to increase policy rates in response to a tightening in US monetary policy or an increase in the VIX, even if they have flexible exchange rates (Obstfeld et al., 2005; Aizenman et al., 2016; Han and Wei, 2018). Table 1 documents this aspect. We regress policy rates for a sample of EMs with flexible exchange rates over Taylor-rule determinants and measures of global financial and monetary conditions.==== The results show that central banks in EMs tend to hike policy rates when the VIX or US policy rates increase. The results are robust to using quarterly or monthly data and estimating the regressions in first differences as in columns (4) and (6).====In this paper, we provide a novel theory through which global financial and monetary shocks can destabilize EMs, even those with flexible exchange rates, and force central banks to react in line with the empirical evidence. This is because of the existence of an “Effective Lower Bound” (ELB) which is an interest rate threshold below which monetary easing becomes contractionary. The ELB arises if monetary easing tightens the balance-sheet constraints faced by domestic banks with sufficient strength. If policy rates are relatively high—above the ELB—banks' balance-sheet constraints do not bind and monetary easing retains conventional expansionary effects. However, if policy rates decline below the ELB, banks become constrained. Further monetary easing has contractionary effects because it generates a credit crunch due to the adverse effects on banks' balance sheets.====The ELB places an upper bound on the level of output that monetary stimulus can achieve. Starting from the ELB, both interest rate cuts and hikes determine a decline in output. The ELB can occur at positive rates and thus act as a more stringent constraint to monetary policy than the zero lower bound (ZLB). Importantly, the ELB is affected by global monetary and financial conditions. A tightening of the global financial cycle leads to an increase in the ELB which may prompt EMs to increase policy rates in line with the empirical evidence. Once the ELB binds, economic activity contracts and EMs lose control over domestic output. Central banks are forced to keep policy rates at the ELB to minimize the output contraction and domestic economic activity becomes determined by the global financial and monetary cycle. This is the case even in countries with flexible exchange rates, providing a crucial departure from Mundell's trilemma.====The ELB may emerge under various circumstances whenever monetary policy affects the tightness of the banks' balance-sheet constraints. To illustrate this point, we provide two different models which capture two major vulnerabilities for EMs. The first model builds on the large literature emphasizing the risks posed by currency mismatches (Céspedes et al., 2004; Christiano et al., 2004; Cook, 2004; Eichengreen et al., 2005).==== As illustrated in the left chart of Fig. 1, foreign currency debt remains elevated in EMs.==== In the model, domestic banks borrow in foreign currency and lend domestically in local currency. Banks are subject to a leverage constraint that limits domestic lending to a multiple of bank net worth. Domestic monetary easing leads to an erosion of bank net worth because it depreciates the exchange rate and raises the local-currency value of foreign-currency debt. If policy rates are sufficiently high, the leverage constraint does not bind and monetary easing is expansionary. However, deep policy rate cuts push banks against the leverage constraint. From this point onward, additional monetary easing can become contractionary since it forces banks to curb credit supply by tightening the leverage constraint. The interest rate at which the leverage constraint becomes binding is the ELB.====Currency mismatches are, however, not a necessary condition for the existence of the ELB. To show this, we provide a second model where the ELB arises because of carry-trade capital flows that respond to the interest rate differential between domestic and foreign currencies.==== As discussed in Blanchard et al. (2016), carry-trade flows are a key concern among EM policymakers especially because foreign investors are playing a growing role in EM local-currency government bond markets, as illustrated in the right chart of Fig. 1. In the model, banks raise domestic deposits, provide domestic loans, and buy government bonds—all denominated in local currency—subject to a leverage constraint. Government bonds are also held by foreign investors whose demand is proportional to the excess return of the bonds over foreign assets. By reducing the excess return on bonds, monetary easing triggers capital outflows. If the bank leverage constraint is not binding, banks can absorb the government bonds sold by foreigners by expanding their balance sheets. Thus, monetary policy retains conventional expansionary effects. However, if the domestic policy rate is reduced too much, capital outflows are large enough that domestic banks reach their leverage constraint. Once the constraint binds, banks have to reduce domestic lending to absorb the bonds liquidated by foreigners. If this credit crunch is sufficiently severe, monetary easing becomes contractionary giving rise to the ELB.====A crucial aspect of our theory is that the ELB is affected by global financial and monetary conditions. In particular, a tightening in global financial and monetary conditions raises the ELB. In the presence of currency mismatches, this happens because of the erosion in bank capital due to the exchange rate depreciation. In the case of carry-trade capital flows, the ELB increases because of a decline in the foreign demand for local bonds. The increase in the ELB can in turn push EMs into a recession and force central banks to raise rates in line with the evidence presented in Table 1.====We also show that the ELB generates a novel inter-temporal trade-off for monetary policy because a tighter ex-ante monetary stance lowers the level of the ELB in the future by strengthening banks' balance sheets. This has three key implications. First, to reduce the likelihood that the ELB may bind in the future, central banks should keep a prudentially tighter ex-ante monetary stance, in line with the findings of Caballero and Simsek (2019). Second, the risk that the ELB may bind in the future implies that monetary policy becomes less effective in stimulating output. This is because the stimulative effect of monetary easing is partially offset by the expectation of a tighter future monetary stance due to the increase in the ELB. Third, EMs may need to increase policy rates in response to a tightening of the global financial cycle even if the ELB is not currently binding. Therefore, the monetary policy responses in Table 1 could be driven just by concerns that the ELB may bind in the future if global financial conditions deteriorate further.====Our framework provides a rationale for using a broad range of policy tools to ease the constraints imposed by the ELB. The effectiveness of these tools and the channels through which they operate depend on the determinants of the ELB.==== For example, the model featuring currency mismatches underscores the role of capital controls in decoupling the exchange rate from domestic monetary conditions. The model with carry-trade flows provides instead a rationale for balance-sheet operations by the central bank—such as quantitative easing and foreign exchange intervention—to restore liquidity in the government debt market. Interestingly, in both models, a forward guidance pledge to provide future monetary stimulus is unable to ease the constraints imposed by the ELB, despite being quite effective against the ZLB from a theory standpoint. This is because the ELB is an endogenous interest threshold that increases if the central bank signals future monetary easing.====The existence of the ELB hinges on the idea that in some instances monetary easing in EMs can be contractionary. There are several reasons to entertain such a possibility. First, the idea of contractionary monetary easing gained prominence already during the 1997 financial crisis in East Asia, when monetary easing was thought to be contractionary because of the balance-sheet effects arising from currency mismatches (Krugman, 1999; Aghion et al., 2000, Aghion et al., 2001; Céspedes et al., 2004; Christiano et al., 2004; Cook, 2004). Second, EM policymakers do express concerns that monetary policy may operate in reverse. For example, they fear that a reduction in policy rates may trigger severe capital outflows, leading to contractionary rather than expansionary effects, a symmetric argument to one discussed in Blanchard et al. (2016). Third, the notion that monetary easing can be contractionary at low interest rates is being examined even in the case of advanced economies because of the impact on bank profitability (Brunnermeier and Koby, 2018; Eggertsson et al., 2019).==== If anything, concerns about monetary transmissions should be more severe in EMs given pervasive financial frictions.",The open-economy ELB: Contractionary monetary easing and the trilemma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001234,9 November 2022,2022,Research Article,42.0

In our novel dataset on instrument-specific haircuts suffered by private creditors in 1999–2020 we find larger losses on short- than long-term debt, independently of the specific haircut measure we use. A standard asset pricing model rationalizes our findings under two assumptions, both of which are satisfied in the data: increasing short-run restructuring risk in the run-up to a restructuring, and high exit yields. We relate our findings to the policy debate on restructuring procedures.","The conventional view among policy makers, practitioners and academics is that the treatment of private creditors in sovereign debt exchanges is broadly symmetric across instruments (Institute of International Finance (IIF), 2012, Institute of International Finance (IIF), 2015). After all, the pari passu clause, which is commonly included in unsecured cross-border corporate and international sovereign debt contracts, provides that the debt instruments issued under such contracts will rank equally among themselves and with all other present or future unsubordinated and unsecured external debt obligations of the borrower (International Monetary Fund (IMF), 2014). More specifically, the empirical literature on sovereign debt restructurings suggests that private creditor losses (“haircuts”) tend to be symmetric across debt instruments of different maturity (e.g., Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2006, Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2008).====In this paper, we challenge this view. We show both empirically and theoretically that creditor losses systematically vary by maturity of debt instrument: haircuts on short-term debt tend to be higher than those on long-term debt.====We establish our results using two different measures of haircuts. The first is a conventional haircut (recovery rate) measure according to Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2006, Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2008, namely the present value of a new instrument relative to the synthetic present value of the old, restructured bond, which reflects both contractual payment obligations pre exchange and the exit yield of the new bond. The second is an “exchange recovery measure” which is computed based on the prices of the new and old bonds. It accounts for the capital gains and losses during the restructuring process and it can be computed for windows of different length before the actual restructuring date.====To construct the two measures, we have assembled novel datasets on instrument-specific haircuts. Our first dataset on SZ recovery rates covers 531 instruments in 44 sovereign debt restructuring episodes (33 external and 11 domestic) that involved private creditors, over the period 1999–2020. Our second dataset on exchange recovery rates covers 129 instruments in 21 sovereign debt restructuring episodes (17 external and 4 domestic) over the same period. It contains information about exchange recovery rates from 6 to 9 months prior to the announcement of a restructuring up to the exchange in monthly frequency (given availability of price data).====We establish three stylized facts. First, haircuts are larger for short- than long-term bonds if measured according to the standard SZ measure. Second, this continues to hold true when we assess haircuts based on the exchange recovery measure of capital losses. Both stylized facts are robust to controlling for characteristics of the exchanged bonds or the restructuring episodes. Our results hold in both external and domestic restructuring episodes; they hold when restructurings occur preemptively or post default; and they hold independently of the exchange method, that is whether the exchange involves a single menu of new instruments vs. different menus, or maturity extension vs. coupon reduction depending on the type of restructured bonds. The facts are also robust to controlling for instrument- and episode-specific effects and the results hold in all subsamples we consider.====The third stylized fact we report explains the negative link between maturity and exchange recovery: In the run-up to a restructuring episode, short-term bond prices tend to converge from above to long-term bond prices. Again, this fact is robust to controlling for instrument- and episode-specific effects, and it holds across different subsamples and horizons.====Next, we show that a standard asset pricing model rationalizes the three stylized facts under two assumptions: That exit yields of newly issued bonds after a restructuring exceed the coupons of old bonds that were exchanged. And that short-term restructuring risk rises in the run-up to a restructuring. The first assumption is necessary for the model to replicate the observed relationship between the SZ haircut measure and maturity. The second assumption implies convergence from above of short- to long-term bond prices.====Intuitively, a higher discount factor reduces the present value of a bond's principal payment. When the exit yield exceeds the coupon rate then the importance of this discounting effect increases with a bond's remaining maturity. Accordingly, high exit yields depress the synthetic present value of old instruments that were exchanged, and especially so for old instruments with a long maturity. As a consequence, the SZ haircut on such long-term bonds is lower.====Regarding the role of restructuring risk, the price of short-term bonds exceeds that of longer-term bonds (holding all other characteristics constant) as long as investors fear restructuring risk after the maturity date of the short-term instrument. Increasing short-term restructuring risk depresses the price of short-term bonds more strongly than of long-term bonds. In the run-up to a restructuring the prices of short-term bonds therefore exceed the prices of long-term bonds, but less and less so as the exchange approaches. Equivalently, the capital losses on short-term bonds exceed those on long-term bonds, but less and less so as the exchange gets priced in.====When we check whether the two model ingredients are borne out by the data, we find that they are: Exit yields tend to be higher than coupon rates, and short-term restructuring risk, as deduced from the prices of credit default swaps, tends to increase in the run-up to a restructuring. In fact, the two regularities turn out to be stylized facts as well across different subsamples, over different horizons, and also when we control for instrument- and episode-specific effects. We conclude that the simple asset pricing model provides a realistic and plausible explanation for our three main findings.====Our results have important implications for the policy debate on how to best design restructuring procedures. In this debate, which most recently originated in assessments of Collective Action Clauses (CACs), proposals have been made to require uniform haircuts. To analyze the consequences of such a requirement, we contrast two restructuring regimes: A regime with uniform (absolute) exchange in which all affected bondholders receive the same payoff in absolute terms, for instance because they receive the same instrument or can choose from an identical menu of instruments; and a regime with uniform haircut in which all affected bondholders suffer the same relative capital losses.====When we compare the two regimes in the theoretical model we find that replacing uniform exchange by uniform haircut could have important price implications. While it could strengthen the bargaining position of short-term bond holders and provide support to short-term bond prices in the run-up to a restructuring it might simultaneously make long-term bond prices much more sensitive to news about restructuring risk and amplify capital losses before the restructuring actually occurs.====Our paper relates to the empirical literature on creditor losses due to restructurings, specifically Eichengreen and Portes, 1986, Eichengreen and Portes, 1989, Lindert and Morton (1989), SZ, Benjamin and Wright (2013), Cruces and Trebesch (2013), and Meyer et al. (2022). Almost all studies report average haircuts for restructuring episodes. Only a few (SZ; Zettelmeyer et al., 2013) document instrument-specific haircuts for selected episodes. In contrast, we report instrument-specific haircuts for a large sample of restructuring episodes; we document novel stylized facts concerning the relationship between haircuts and maturity; and we propose an explanation for these facts.====Our paper also contributes to the theoretical literature building on Eaton and Gersovitz' (1981) classic framework and studying the maturity structure of sovereign debt.==== In particular, our paper is related to Broner et al. (2013), Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012), and Sánchez et al. (2018) who analyze the time variation in sovereign yield curves and expected bond returns for different maturities. These papers emphasize factors that affect default risk (such as output, sudden stop probability or investor risk aversion) but they disregard differential haircuts across maturity, assuming instead that haircuts always equal 100%. By contrast we focus on debt restructuring episodes and analyze the haircut maturity structure and its drivers, both empirically and theoretically.====Finally, our paper has implications for theoretical work on sovereign default and debt renegotiation as a bargaining game between a sovereign debtor and its creditors (see, for instance, Yue, 2010, Bai and Zhang, 2012, Benjamin and Wright, 2013, Hatchondo et al., 2014, Asonuma and Trebesch 2016). These papers aim at explaining haircuts and the duration of renegotiation and they assume that haircuts after default are symmetric across maturities. Our work shows that haircuts differ across maturities, pointing to an additional dimension of debt renegotiations and possibly additional moments for quantitative sovereign debt models to target.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 defines two measures of creditor losses (haircuts), introduces our datasets, and documents the three stylized facts on haircuts, maturity and bond price dynamics. Section 3 presents a theoretical model of sovereign bond prices to rationalize the stylized facts. Section 4 explores whether two model assumptions are supported by the data and establishes that they are. Section 5 discusses the policy implications of our results. Section 6 concludes.","Sovereign bond prices, haircuts and maturity",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001210,9 November 2022,2022,Research Article,43.0

We provide evidence that this caused suppliers to substitute towards Mexican-produced methamphetamine. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we show that the ==== of precursor controls on lab seizures was largest in the middle of the United States. This is consistent with substitution towards imports, where differences in each region's ability to substitute towards imports generates heterogeneous effects on domestic production. To quantify the effect of precursor controls on domestic costs and imports, we estimate a model of illicit methamphetamine production using data on lab seizures and methamphetamine prices. We find that precursor controls increased domestic costs by 114%–190%. Substitution towards Mexican-produced methamphetamine decreased the effect of precursor controls on methamphetamine prices by 62%–83%, relative to a counterfactual world without import substitution.","Every year, the US government allocates significant resources to combat drug consumption. For example, between 2007 and 2017 the US government spent 13.8 to 28.8 billion USD per year on its national drug control strategy (Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2008, Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2019), with the majority of these expenditures allocated to supply-side policies based on the enforcement of drug trafficking laws (Caulkins et al., 2006; Dobkin and Nicosia, 2009; Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2019).==== Unfortunately, little success has been achieved so far. Between 2007 and 2017 the US saw a 7.3% increase in the number of individuals aged twelve and older seeking treatment for substance abuse, excluding alcohol (SAMHSA, 2019).====There are two key channels that may explain the failure of supply-side enforcement policies. First, enforcement campaigns aiming to decrease supply by increasing costs may fail to make illicit production unprofitable if costs do not increase by a large enough margin. Second, enforcement campaigns may prove unsuccessful due to the “balloon effect,” where enforcement leads illicit supply chains to relocate to areas of lower resistance, similar to the displacement of air within a squeezed balloon (Windle and Farrell, 2012). Separating these two effects is important for identifying the set of policies that are most likely to succeed in combating illicit drug growth. Failure due to the first channel suggests that more stringent policies are needed, whereas failure due to the second channel suggests that greater coordination across jurisdictions is required to successfully decrease supply.====In this paper, we provide the first empirical estimates of the magnitude of the balloon effect by studying the reallocation of illicit methamphetamine production to Mexico following the phase-in of over-the-counter (OTC) “precursor control” laws across the US from 2004 to 2006. These laws made it harder for US consumers to obtain cold medications containing ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine; two inputs which are often used in illicit methamphetamine production. We provide novel evidence that this policy led to increased reliance on methamphetamine imports from Mexico, and then estimate a structural model of methamphetamine production that allows us to quantify how import shares and methamphetamine prices react to precursor controls.====While available evidence largely indicates that precursor control laws were effective at decreasing domestic production of illicit methamphetamine (e.g. McBride et al., 2008; Weisheit and Wells, 2010; Gilbreath, 2013; Dobkin et al., 2014), law enforcement agencies have argued that the effectiveness of precursor controls was blunted by the relocation of methamphetamine production to Mexico (e.g. National Drug Intelligence Center, 2007, pg. 6). Fig. 1 provides some mixed evidence in favour of this view. In panel (a), we plot the total number of illicit methamphetamine labs seized by law enforcement agencies from 2000 to 2008. We see a sharp decrease in the total number of labs seized from 2004 onward, consistent with the decline of domestic production following precursor controls. In panel (b), we plot the total quantity of methamphetamine seized at the southwest border from 2000 to 2008. We find that this proxy for imports largely trended upwards from 2000 to 2006, although there appears to be a dip in border seizures in 2007.==== While these aggregate trends may indicate some degree of substitution towards Mexican-produced methamphetamine following precursor controls, it is difficult to make any strong conclusions as these patterns could also be generated by a reaction to other trends unrelated to the implementation of precursor controls in the US.====We provide novel evidence that precursor controls increased methamphetamine imports by examining variation in the effectiveness of precursor controls across US core-base statistical areas (CBSAs). For this purpose, we exploit variation in the timing of precursor controls across states to identify precursor control effects from other trends, similar to Dobkin et al. (2014). A key obstacle to using this strategy is that methamphetamine import data is unavailable at finer units of geography. To address this, we show that a simple model of methamphetamine production where domestic producers can choose to produce methamphetamine locally or import methamphetamine from abroad, predicts that precursor controls will generate non-monotonic declines in production as one moves further from the southern border. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy applied to lab seizures per capita, we then show that precursor controls generated exactly this pattern of treatment effect heterogeneity across U.S. CBSAs, providing novel corroborating evidence of the balloon effect in practice.====We then estimate a structural model of methamphetamine production across local drug markets to quantify the balloon effect. This exercise proceeds in three steps. First, we use geographical variation in the distance of each CBSA to the US-Mexico border to estimate the sensitivity of local methamphetamine production to cost shocks. Second, we apply a difference-in-differences identification strategy to lab seizures across regions, using information on average prices to control for the magnitude of import substitution generated by the policy. We show that this regression allows us to estimate the average causal effect of precursor controls on domestic marginal costs. Finally, we use these estimates to quantify the magnitude of the balloon effect using counterfactual experiments that compare how much prices would have risen if import substitution was impossible, to how much prices rise when suppliers can switch to foreign production following the cost shock.====Our results imply that precursor controls would have, on average, more than doubled the price of illicit methamphetamine in the absence of a reorganization of supply chains towards Mexican-produced methamphetamine. These price increases were much smaller in practice as import substitution dampened the effect of precursor controls on prices by as much as 83% in CBSAs located close to the southern border, and by 62% to 70% in northeastern CBSAs. These large magnitudes imply that the balloon effect is of first-order importance for examining the effectiveness of supply-focused policies in this market.====Our paper contributes to three different literatures. The first is the empirical literature examining precursor control laws in illicit methamphetamine markets (McBride et al., 2008; Dobkin and Nicosia, 2009; Weisheit and Wells, 2010; Nonnemaker et al., 2011; Cunningham et al., 2012; Gilbreath, 2013; Dobkin et al., 2014; Cunningham and Finlay, 2016, and d'Este, 2019). The most closely related of these papers, Dobkin et al. (2014), also leverages differential timing of precursor controls across states to estimate the average effect of precursor controls. They find that precursor controls decreased lab seizures, while having little to no effect on average prices and drug tests. The authors argue these results suggest that methamphetamine production shifted across borders. Building on this, we show that ==== in the degree to which precursor controls affected lab seizures is also consistent with import substitution. We then use this policy experiment to estimate a simple structural model of methamphetamine production, which allows us to provide the first quantitative estimates of the magnitude of balloon effect.====This paper also contributes to a larger literature examining the effectiveness of supply-side policies in curbing the production and distribution of illicit drugs more generally (DiNardo, 1993; Yuan and Caulkins, 1998; Miron, 2003; Kuziemko and Levitt, 2004; Becker et al., 2006; Dell, 2015; Mejia and Restrepo, 2016; Mejía et al., 2017; Castillo et al., 2020). Of these studies, Mejia and Restrepo (2016) is the most closely related to our work. They examine the cost-effectiveness of various enforcement policies targeting illicit cocaine trade in Colombia by calibrating a model of illicit drug supply chains that allows for foreign substitution effects. A limitation of their study is the lack of a clear control group to credibly separate the effect of Plan Colombia, a large supply-side intervention targeting illicit cocaine production, from general macroeconomic trends. One contribution of our study is that we are able to implement standard research designs — namely, difference-in-differences and instrumental variables methods — to identify foreign substitution in response to precursor controls separately from general macroeconomic trends.====Finally, our paper makes a modest contribution to the literature on estimating quantitative trade models. As in Eaton and Kortum (2002), Dekle et al. (2008) and Donaldson (2018) our counterfactuals of interest rely heavily on estimating a “trade elasticity”; a single parameter governing how easy it is for sellers to switch to imports following a domestic cost shock. While this parameter is often estimated using data on the flows of goods across countries (see Head and Mayer, 2014, as well as Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare, 2014), we lack data on illicit methamphetamine trade flows at the CBSA level. Therefore, we develop a novel approach to estimating the trade elasticity. We show that an IV regression of consumption of locally-produced goods on average prices identifies the trade elasticity, where average prices are instrumented by a proxy for trade costs that is uncorrelated with local costs. These identification results may be of further independent interest, as they highlight novel sources of variation that may be used to identify the trade elasticity in more standard settings.",Import substitution in illicit methamphetamine markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001222,8 November 2022,2022,Research Article,44.0

Using monthly customs data in China from January 2017 to May 2019, we find that the launch of the trade war against Chinese exports by the US on average reduces Chinese total exports to the US by 16.47%. Further decomposition shows that the reduction in exports is mostly explained by a decrease in quantity, with prices relatively unchanged. Meanwhile, negative trade shocks cause export diversion to countries that are closer and have larger economies, and exports in R&D-intensive, skilled-labor-intensive, high-capital-income-share, and upstream ","After decades of trade liberalization, anti-globalization momentum has recently increased. Leading examples are the waves of tariff increases launched by the US in 2018 and the UK's withdrawal from the European Union (EU). This momentum has spurred concerns about how increases in trade protectionism affect the global economy.====A starting point in understanding the effects of trade protection is to investigate how it affects exporting behavior. Although a considerable literature documents the effects of trade liberalization, these results may not directly apply to the recent state of trade protection. First, the gains and losses may not be symmetric. Specifically, a reduction in tariffs triggers the entry of new exporters, who incur fixed costs of investment; in contrast, exits from exporting markets induced by tariff increases entail the liquidation of exporting network assets. Second, with the significant investment in transportation and communication infrastructures in past decades, trade diversion could easily be achieved, especially for incumbent exporters that operate in multiple countries. Third, the world is now more integrated with respect to the global production chain, which complicates the effects of tariffs.====This study makes three contributions to the literature by studying the US-China trade war in 2018. Specifically, the Trump administration in the US launched several waves of tariff increases on specific products imported from China in mid-2018. The trade war started with steel and aluminum products in February 2018 and was followed by three rounds of tariff increases that sequentially covered all Chinese exports. First, we have access to monthly customs data in China from January 2017 to May 2019, which spans the period of the US-China trade war. These data allow us to examine the actual responses of exporters to negative trade shocks. In addition, the several waves of tariff increases on specific products from China to the US in mid-2018 provide us with an identification strategy to examine the short-run effects of trade protection on exporting behavior. Second, we decompose the trade-protection effect on exports into quantity and price components and investigate whether export diversion occurs and, if so, to which countries. This approach yields a clear picture of how exports respond to trade protection. Third, because of the terms-of-trade effect, we use firm-level monthly transaction data to exploit the underlying reasons for price response—specifically, the compositional change and wage response.====We obtain four sets of empirical findings. First, we conduct a difference-in-differences (DD) analysis by comparing war-affected products with war-unaffected products before and after the tariff increases. We find that the launch of the trade war against Chinese exports by the US reduces Chinese total exports to the US by 16.47% on average. Translating this percentage into the elasticity of exports to tariffs, we find that when statutory tariff 1 + ==== increases by 1%, exports for war-affected products drop by 0.69% on average. Meanwhile, for war-affected products with their applied tariffs increased, the average trade elasticity is 1.99. Our estimates are smaller than the corresponding values inferred from the imports data in the US by Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) (i.e., the average trade elasticity associated with statutory tariffs for war-affected products is 1.52, and for war-affected products with their applied tariffs increased is 2.50). Both the data discrepancies (i.e., data by US importers vs. those by Chinese exporters) and specification difference (i.e., triple difference vs. DD) account for this difference, with the former explaining 31% and the latter explaining the remaining 69% of the difference. Meanwhile, our estimate of the short-run effects of trade protection is higher than the corresponding effect of trade liberalization. Specifically, in a comparable caliber, our instrumental variable (IV) estimates of trade elasticity associated with applied tariffs are 1.99 within a year, whereas Boehm et al. (2020), using a global database, find a trade elasticity associated with applied MFN tariffs from the IV estimation of approximately 0.7 in one year. These results suggest that trade liberalization and trade protection have different short-term effects on exports.====Second, we decompose the effect on total exports into the quantity effect and the price effect to shed light on export responses to trade protection. We find that the drop in Chinese exports to the US caused by the additional tariffs is mostly explained by decreases in quantity, with prices relatively unchanged. These results are consistent with recent studies on the trade-protection movement under the Trump administration using US import and consumer price data (i.e., Amiti et al., 2019; Cavallo et al., 2021; Fajgelbaum et al., 2020). These studies find that the tariffs on Chinese exports are completely passed through to US consumers, with import prices almost unchanged. Although our study differs from those studies in terms of data (i.e., Chinese export data vs. US import and consumer price data) and perspective (i.e., exporting behavior vs. importing and consumption behavior), the consistent conclusions of the two lines of research lend support to our identification.====Third, we investigate trade-diversion effects. We find that while US tariffs significantly reduced Chinese exports to the US, they barely affected Chinese total exports to the world. To further understand how China diverts its exports from the US to other countries, we correlate the diversion magnitude to features across countries and industries. We find that in response to the trade war, China is more likely to divert its exports to countries that are closer and have larger economies. Meanwhile, the export of products in R&D-intensive, skilled-labor-intensive, high-capital-income-share, and upstream industries have been diverted even more.====Fourth, to understand the distributional effects of trade protection, we study the heterogeneity of treatment effects with respect to some industry features, including input-factor intensity, comparative advantage, elasticity of substitution, exporting experience, and so on. Specifically, we find that exports are more sensitive to trade protection in labor-intensive industries than in capital-intensive ones, more sensitive in unskilled-labor-intensive industries than in skilled-labor-intensive ones, and more sensitive in R&D-scarce industries than in R&D-intensive ones. Because China has comparative advantages in labor-intensive industries, unskilled-labor-intensive industries, and R&D-scarce industries, these results consistently suggest that a country's comparative-advantage industries are more responsive to trade protection, and the same conclusions are obtained from the perspective of industry's revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index. Further, exports of products in industries with high export growth, large initial export value, and high elasticity of substitution decrease more in response to trade protection.====This paper mainly contributes to the recent literature that analyzes the impacts of the 2018 trade war. For instance, Amiti et al. (2019), Cavallo et al. (2021), and Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) have investigated the effects of the trade war on the US economy. However, we still know little about the effect of the trade war on the economy of China, which is the largest developing country in the world. Our research on export responses complements this strand of the literature.====Our study is related to the literature on trade elasticities, which are of central importance in the quantitative analysis of trade models. However, considerable disagreement exists about the magnitude of trade elasticities. Specifically, studies that rely on cross-sectional variation (often considered microanalysis) yield high values for trade elasticity of around 5 or higher (e.g., Head and Ries, 2001; Eaton and Kortum, 2002; Romalis, 2007; Caliendo and Parro, 2015).==== Meanwhile, studies that exploit time-series variation in trade costs (often considered macroanalysis) are often seen as capturing short-run adjustments to trade costs and yield low estimates for trade elasticity of approximately 1 or less (e.g., Bergstrand, 1989; Shiells and Reinert, 1993; Hillberry and Hummels, 2013; Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2016). The literature often attributes these discrepancies to attenuation bias due to measurement error and the endogeneity of trade costs (Bagwell and Staiger, 2016). Most estimates based on gravity models do not attempt to address the reverse causality of tariffs with respect to trade flows (Boehm et al., 2020). We exploit the quasi-experimental variation in import tariffs induced by the trade war between China and the US in mid-2018 to estimate short-run trade elasticity, which is especially crucial for the quantitative analysis of structural gravity models of international trade.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the policy's background, data, and estimation strategy. Section 3 presents the empirical findings, including the effects on exports to the US, trade-diversion effects, and the heterogeneity of responses across industries.

Yet, there is little causal evidence on ==== and ==== cross-country labor mobility can benefit production organization and international trade performance. The major obstacles are represented by the fact that the responsiveness of foreign workers' flows is typically not independent from trade flows and the economic environment, and that data is usually not detailed enough to study the mechanisms at play.====This paper circumvents these issues by exploiting micro trade data from Switzerland and the exogenous variation arising from a natural experiment: the staggered opening of the Swiss labor market to European workers mandated by the Swiss-EU Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (AFMP). The agreement removed quotas and the bureaucratic procedures needed to hire EU workers in Switzerland, thus making them comparable to native workers. Two features allow for causal inference. First, the agreement was implemented at different times in the different Swiss regions. Second, within the same region the increase in the share of foreign workers varied depending on the distance from the border. This is because most of the increase was accounted by cross-border workers, which need to commute daily from a border country to their Swiss employer.====I find that the large number of high-skilled European workers that arrived in Switzerland following the implementation of the AFMP led to an increase in the quality of imported intermediate inputs coming from their origin country. This suggests that they brought novel knowledge about existing suppliers from their home countries that lowered upstream information frictions. The use of better inputs is associated with better quality of exported products, and with higher export growth toward extra-EU destinations due to more exports to existing customers and the acquisition of new ones. Since export growth was not especially directed to the foreign workers' origin countries, their increasing availability does not seem to have decreased downstream information frictions. Therefore, quality upgrading represents the main determinant of export expansion. These results clearly show that new foreign workers do not merely represent additional labor for the receiving countries. They bring with them up-to-date information about their origin countries that is crucial for optimizing the organization of global value chains (GVC), for producing quality products, and for reaching distant markets. In other words, they possess specific human capital in the form of knowledge about their origin country that is useful for firms in the host country. Therefore, any occurrence of labor market jeopardization due to reduced labor mobility, such as Brexit or the current COVID-19 pandemic, can harm the capability of improving quality and organizing production and sales internationally.====The AFMP was signed in 1999. It was fully implemented in Switzerland in 2004 for localities (i.e., postal codes) in the border region, and in 2007 for those in the central region. The agreement was hugely successful in attracting foreign workers to Switzerland. Following its implementation, cross-border workers almost doubled and resident immigrant workers increased by 29%. The incoming flows were composed mostly by high-skilled workers coming from border countries and landed working for high-tech industries. The increase in resident immigrants did not show any geographical pattern, and the time discontinuity attributable to the agreement is rather mild. Instead, because cross-border workers have a limited propensity to spend long times getting to work, their share increased substantially only in localities within 15 min drive from the border crossing. Localities 15 to 30 min from the border were only mildly affected, and those more than 30 min remained practically untouched. Crucially, these changes closely follow the timing of the agreement implementation. Exports experienced a similar pattern: they grew more in postal codes closer to the border. This growth was especially strong for high-tech products and for extra-EU destinations, and it is mostly explained by an increase in the average exports per destination and product, while the extensive margins (i.e., number of products and destinations) did not play any role.====To provide evidence on the effects of the agreement, I implement a difference-in-differences strategy that uses the variation in both the timing (across border and central regions) and the intensity (within the same region depending on the distance from the border) at which localities were affected by the inflow of cross-border workers.==== In particular, I consider as highly treated the localities within 15 min from the border, mildly treated those between 15 and 30 min from the border and as control those more than 30 min from the border. I find that the AFMP increased aggregate exports in treated localities more than in control ones and this effect is almost exclusively due to the average exports per product and destination, while the number of products and the number of destinations played only a marginal role. This result allows me to exploit the granularity of the data to compare the exports of the same product to the same destination across treated and control postal codes before and after the implementation of the agreement. This setting is particularly appealing for two reasons. First, because compositional differences in terms of products and destinations across treated and control localities do not play any role. Second, by discarding product and destination entry and exit, I still keep the bulk of Swiss exports, i.e., 80% of observed trade flows and more than 90% of trade values. With this strategy, I find that highly treated localities (i.e., those within 15 min of the border) increased exports more than unaffected ones (i.e., those more than 30 min from the border) but I do not observe any differential effect for localities only mildly affected (i.e., those 15 to 30 min from the border).====This export growth was mostly concentrated on extra-EU destinations. Therefore, it is unlikely that foreign workers lowered downstream information frictions by providing export-relevant information about their origin countries. Instead, by decomposing exports into quantities and prices, I find that an increase in the former is not followed by a decrease in the latter. This suggests that the quality of Swiss products produced in border postal codes increased. To dig deeper into this finding, I construct a measure of perceived quality based on the methodology developed in Khandelwal et al. (2013) and I find evidence that the appeal of Swiss products produced in affected postal codes increased following the AFMP. Therefore, quality upgrading shows to be a major factor behind export growth, and it helped penetrating distant destinations.====How could foreign workers improve the quality of exports? The most direct way is by bringing new skills or technologies from their home countries (e.g., Bahar and Rapoport, 2018; Bahar et al., 2022). However, I find that export growth was not concentrated on the products for which neighboring countries have a comparative advantage, thus suggesting that foreign workers did not bring origin-specific skills or technologies that improved existing products. A second way to improve the quality of exported products is by using better intermediate inputs. Indeed, I observe that postal codes which experienced an increase in the quality of exports also improved the quality (measured as unit prices) of inputs employed in the production of exported products coming from the foreign workers' origin countries.====To assess the existence of a causal link between the quality of inputs and the quality of exported products, I test whether, following the implementation of the AFMP, growth in intermediate input prices arriving from border countries affected price and quality growth of a particular product-destination export pair differently for treated and control postal codes. This difference-in-differences strategy gets rid of all the time-invariant endogeneity issues, and to the extent that any unobserved time-variant shock is not correlated with the time and regional implementation of the AFMP, it also delivers sensitive coefficients. Using this strategy, I find that the increase in prices of foreign workers' origin-country inputs is positively and significantly related to export price and quality growth only for the highly treated postal codes. While it could be unsurprising that growth in imported inputs prices is related to growth in exported prices and quality, I show that this relation increased more for highly treated postal codes than for those in the control group following the AFMP. Moreover, adding to the same specification also the prices of inputs from other countries, I find that their growth is not differentially affecting price and quality of exported products.====These results suggest that input quality upgrading can be considered as a driving force underneath export growth, and information frictions decreased upstream thanks to the knowledge of foreign workers arriving from border countries.==== Importantly, I do not claim that this is the only mechanism that could explain export growth in the context of the AFMP. Labor-constrained firms, local spillovers, specific human capital, and complementarity between high-skilled labor and high-quality intermediate products can represent additional channels. However, upstream information frictions decreased ==== with respect to foreign workers' origin countries, and only inputs imported from these countries were responsible for the increase in export quality. Moreover, when controlling for these alternative mechanisms my results do not change. It is therefore hard to argue that my empirical results can be rationalized exclusively by mechanisms that do not involve country-specific information frictions.====Finally, using disaggregated custom-level data for China and France, I provide descriptive evidence on the global value chains changes implied by the AFMP. Analyzing import flows, I find that the increase in product quality fostered Swiss exports to China more than it did to France, and made it possible to sell more to existing customers and to find new ones. Looking at export flows, I find that the quality of intermediate inputs sold to Switzerland increased more in France than in China. This quality growth is driven mostly by existing suppliers and products. Therefore, this anecdotal evidence further indicates that the AFMP helped in hiring workers with knowledge about existing French suppliers that was instrumental to improving the quality of inputs. It is likely that these workers were previously employed by the suppliers or they had previous relations with them, for example, working for another competing customer or simply in another firm in the same industry.====The positive role of migrants on trade has been extensively analyzed by various papers (e.g., Head and Ries, 1998; Rauch, 1999, Rauch, 2001; Rauch and Trindade, 2002; Felbermayr and Toubal, 2012). While most of the earlier contributions fail to convincingly assess a causal relation due to endogeneity issues and poor data quality (Felbermayr et al., 2015), recent papers use instrumental variable strategies (Peri and Raquena-Silvente, 2010; Ottaviano et al., 2018; Cardoso and Ramanarayanan, 2019; Marchal and Nedoncelle, 2019; Orefice et al., 2021) or natural experiments (Parsons and Vézina, 2018; Bahar et al., 2022; Olney and Pozzoli, 2021) to assess causality. However, these papers either do not allow to distinguish the skill of the migrant or embed almost exclusively low skilled migrant flows (mostly from developing countries), and we know little about the mechanisms by which foreign workers foster trade. Bahar and Rapoport (2018), Orefice et al. (2021), and Bahar et al. (2022) argue that migrants can affect trade by bringing information on their origin country (network effect), by bringing new skills and general knowledge for production (knowledge diffusion effect), or by optimizing the diversity at the firm or country level (diversity effect). My paper makes two main contributions to this literature. First, I analyze a new and unexplored setting in which a developed country receives a large number of high-skilled workers from other developed countries. Second, the Swiss data and the unique features of the AFMP implementation make it possible to open the black box of the knowledge diffusion effect and to identify a new mechanism by which foreign workers can foster trade.====Several studies show how communication technologies, such as the telegraph (Steinwender, 2018; Juhasz and Steinwender, 2018), mobile phones (Jensen, 2007; Allen, 2014), web hosts (Freund and Weinhold, 2004), Internet broadband access (Leuven et al., 2018; Malgouyres et al., 2019), and telephone call rates (Fink et al., 2005; Portes and Rey, 2005) have fostered trade by lowering the burden of communication. My results contribute to this literature by showing that also international labor mobility can soften information frictions. More specifically, foreign workers bring origin-specific knowledge that is instrumental to improve the quality of inputs (e.g., Bernard et al., 2019), and, in turns, input quality affects export quality (e.g., Kugler and Verhoogen, 2012; Manova and Zhang, 2012; Bastos et al., 2018) and export growth, especially in distant destinations (e.g., Hummels and Skiba, 2004; Baldwin and Harrigan, 2011; Martin and Mayneris, 2015). Other related contributions (e.g., Balsvik, 2011; Mion and Opromolla, 2014; Parrotta et al., 2014; Mion et al., 2016; Parrotta et al., 2016; Bernard et al., 2019) analyze more generally the role of workers' experience for export performance and firm productivity. My paper quantifies the specific role of foreign workers' knowledge and identifies the mechanism by which they foster trade.====Together with Egger et al. (2019), my paper brings a new perspective to the literature analyzing the determinants of global value chains (e.g., Antràs et al., 2012; Antràs and Chor, 2013; Alfaro et al., 2019) by demonstrating that labor mobility is crucial for their efficacy. Using an instrumental strategy to assess causality, Egger et al. (2019) show that immigration leads to a decline in the number of suppliers that are contracted within a given source-country-product-group, an intensification of the remaining relationships, and a greater stability of these matches. My paper instead uses a natural experiment to analyze the mechanisms by which foreign workers can affect the structure of the international production and the quality of inputs and output.====More broadly, this paper contributes to the literature pointing at the positive effects of foreign workers on the economy. This research strand focuses on FDI activity (Kugler and Rapoport, 2007; Javorcik et al., 2011; Burchardi et al., 2019), productivity (Kerr and Lincoln, 2010; Ghosh et al., 2014; Hornung, 2014; Ruffner and Siegenthaler, 2016; Mayda et al., 2018; Mitaritonna et al., 2018), and innovation (Cristelli and Lissoni, 2020; Gray et al., 2020). My analysis provides another dimension in which foreign workers are beneficial to the economy. Moreover, it qualifies the results of Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2016) in so that part of the increase in sales and productivity for Swiss firms that they observe following the implementation of the AFMP is driven by exports growth and by an increase in input quality led by the origin-specific knowledge of new foreign workers.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Swiss-EU agreement. Section 3 presents the data and provides some stylized facts. Section 4 outlines the empirical strategy and discusses the results. Section 5 analyzes the possible mechanisms. Section 6 studies the GVCs implications of the AFMP. Section 7 concludes.","Foreign workers, product quality, and trade: Evidence from a natural experiment",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001180,18 October 2022,2022,Research Article,50.0

Over the same period, manufacturing output as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) declined from 34% to 15% in the U.S. whereas the share of manufacturing value added in total value added declined from 19% to 12.7% across Western Europe.==== Several recent studies (e.g., Acemoglu et al. (2016), Autor et al. (2016), and Pierce and Schott (2016)) have pointed to globalization as a significant cause of such declines in high-income countries. Recently, these analyses have received a great deal of attention as the decline in manufacturing employment has been associated with increased income inequality, significant social change, and political pressures.==== It is noteworthy that many people also tie the decline in the relevance of the manufacturing sector and employment to increased environmental standards in high-income countries. For example, survey evidence (e.g., from ====) suggests that a sizable majority of the American public believes that the U.S. strong environmental standards place it at a competitive disadvantage in global markets. Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that the decision to join an international environmental agreement (IEA) is often controversial with much of the discussion centering around its effects on “competitiveness” in global markets (e.g., see the debate regarding whether the U.S. should have ratified the Kyoto Protocol).====Given the relevance of the topic and the surrounding political debate over the past several decades, it could be assumed that we possess causal evidence that links the ratification of IEAs with losses of comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector of high-income countries. Instead, systematic evidence of this kind is limited, and this is the very gap addressed by this paper. Starting from the premise that IEAs are accompanied by increased environmental regulation, which may increase production costs (at least for the most polluting industries), we analyze the effect of IEA ratification on bilateral industry-level exports within a gravity regression framework.====Previewing the results of our analysis, we find a significant (both quantitatively and statistically) compositional shift in exports away from dirty and towards clean industries the more IEAs an exporting country ratifies (compared to its trade partners). Thus, IEAs ratification does appear to have contributed to the decline in manufacturing production in certain (high pollution-intensive) industries among member countries. However, we also find that this decline in dirty-good exports has been compensated by an increase in exports of cleaner industries within these member countries. Indeed, in general we find statistically or quantitatively insignificant effects of IEAs ratification on the exports and imports for the typical (median emission intensity) manufacturing sector. Thus, there is little, if any at all, evidence that the proliferation of IEAs over the past several decades has been a major contributor to the general trend of manufacturing decline in high-income countries.====The more recent literature on the impact of environmental policy on trade flows has typically used instrumental variable approaches (to control for the endogeneity of environmental policy) and panel data techniques (to address the unobserved heterogeneity across panels in addition to the endogenous environmental policy choice). One strand of this literature exploits cross-industry variation in the stringency of environmental regulation (e.g., estimated by industry pollution abatement costs) to test if industries facing an increase in environmental regulation observed a decline in net exports (e.g., see Ederington and Minier (2003), Ederington et al. (2005), and Levinson and Taylor (2008)). Another exploits regional variation in environmental stringency (e.g., estimated from survey data or fuel standards) to test if regions that increased regulatory stringency saw a decline in economic activity (e.g., see Tobey (1990), Millimet and List (2004), Kellenberg (2009), and Broner et al. (2012)). This paper is closer to the second vein as we are using cross-country variation in IEA membership to analyze the policy-relevant question of how joining an IEA affects the competitiveness of a country's manufacturing exports on global markets.====The analysis conducted here is closely related to that in De Santis (2012) and Aichele and Felbermayr, 2013a, Aichele and Felbermayr, 2015, all of which contain estimates of the effects of membership in an IEA on a country's trade flows.==== The most comparable is Aichele and Felbermayr (2015) which uses a sample of 40 countries over the period 1995–2007 to analyze the effect of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on imports, carbon dioxide (CO====) intensity of imports, and the CO==== content of imports of member countries. In common with their approach, we use a gravity framework along with time-varying country fixed effects to control for endogenous participation in IEAs. Our paper makes several contributions to this literature. First, instead of focusing on a single agreement, we provide a unified analysis that considers all 13 major IEAs targeting air pollution over the past 40 years. This both allows us to control for membership across multiple IEAs, but also allows us to attempt to disentangle the possible heterogeneous effects by type of IEA (i.e., targeting acid rain, climate change, or ozone depletion).==== Second, we utilize industry-level trade data and exploit cross-industry variation in emissions intensities to investigate whether the ratification of IEAs implies heterogeneous effects across manufacturing industries. This approach allows us to investigate potential general equilibrium effects of IEAs ratification (e.g., whether increased regulatory stringency increases exports in cleaner manufacturing industries). Finally, we rely on a much expanded dataset: 205 countries observed for over 40 years.==== Our long time span allows us to not only analyze a broader spectrum of IEAs, but also recover the lagged effects of IEAs ratification. This is important because the short-run effects of IEA ratification might differ from their long-run counterparts given the possibly delayed adjustment arising from large, fixed costs and uncertain emission-abatement innovations in manufacturing industries.====With respect to the distinction between the short and long-run impacts of IEA ratification, we find that much of the trade response to the set of acid rain agreements (which were initiated by the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Pollution in 1979) occurred in the short run (i.e., the first three years after ratification). In contrast, the more recent Kyoto agreement exhibits much stronger delayed impacts. Specifically, we find that the compositional shift towards cleaner exports driven by ratification of the Kyoto agreement becomes stronger in the long run. In contrast, the negative impact of Kyoto ratification on the general competitiveness of the median manufacturing industry tends to decline in the long run. For example, consistent with Aichele and Felbermayr (2015) (which found that Kyoto ratification led to a 5% decline in aggregate exports) we find that Kyoto ratification leads to a decline in exports of the median manufacturing industry of around 3.8% if we restrict ourselves to their sample of countries and years (1995–2007). However, just extending the years of the sample to 2018 flips the sign of this estimate so that now Kyoto ratification leads, in this longer time span, to an ==== in median industry exports by 3.4%. As we show, this is due to the delayed impacts of Kyoto ratification.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a non-technical presentation of the theoretical and empirical work that analyzes how IEAs may affect exports, as well as summary of the IEAs included in the empirical analysis. Section 3 presents details about the empirical approach, the data we use, and the construction of the covariates. Section 4 discusses the baseline results (i.e., that ratifying an IEA leads to a compositional shift towards exporting cleaner manufacturing goods) and Section 5 investigates the impact of ratification on the median manufacturing industry. Section 6 delves into potential lagged effects of IEA ratification while Section 7 distinguishes between import and export flows to analyze the potential for IEA membership to lead to pollution leakage (i.e., IEAs ratification leading to increased imports of dirty goods from non-member countries).

We study these unequal impacts building on the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) gravity model of Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016). We augment the original model with a home bias in tastes and allow for trade costs to differ for domestic and foreign trade. In this setup, we show that the structural parameters governing the welfare gains are highly sensitive to the determinants of spending on domestic goods. This extension largely weakens the pro-poor bias of trade which leads us to conclude that the AIDS gravity framework does not generate robust results about the distributive effects of trade within countries.","Recent research in international trade has put a strong focus on quantifying the welfare gains from trade using parsimonious models (Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare, 2014). This approach provides a simple way to calculate how a representative agent benefits from access to new or cheaper foreign goods. When preferences are non-homothetic, however, a household's consumption basket – and its gains from trade - depend on its position in the income distribution. Thus, for example, if international trade reduces the relative price of the goods typically consumed by poor households, the poor stand to gain relatively more from trade than the rich. Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) provide one of the most elegant models to address this question, based on an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), and find a strong pro-poor bias of international trade.====This paper revisits the distributional welfare effects of trade in an AIDS model. We extend the setup of Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) with an additional determinant of spending on domestic goods, which can be interpreted equivalently as a home bias in taste or as a border effect in the costs of trade. We quantify the gains from trade for four different specifications of the model, where each specification varies the degree to which the parameters governing domestic and foreign trade can differ. The welfare conclusions are very sensitive to our extension and point to rather equally distributed gains from trade in the most flexible model, even reverting the direction of the gains from trade-bias for some countries. In sum, these results imply that the AIDS gravity model is unable to generate robust insights on the distributive effects of international trade within countries.====Household-level gains from trade in the AIDS model are governed by the price elasticities and the income elasticities of different goods. Both sets of elasticities are estimated from a structural gravity equation, derived from the AIDS preferences, on aggregate data only. The identification of the income elasticity for a country's goods notably relies on the income per capita of the destinations. In line with the theory, the gravity equation is estimated on data that includes intra-national trade flows. In the basic AIDS model, the fact that a poor country like India spends much on its home goods contributes to identifying Indian goods as having a low income elasticity.====While income-driven spending allocation certainly plays a role, there are other possible explanations for a high proportion of spending on domestic goods. Two candidate explanations are a country-specific home bias in taste, or different trade costs for foreign and domestic trade. For example, Indian products may be tailored to the taste of Indian consumers and trade costs domestically may be lower than for international shipments due to additional administrative burdens. We extend the model and allow for either explanation. The very flexible specification nests the original model as well as two intermediate cases. The first is one with a constant home bias across countries and symmetric trade costs, akin to adding an “international” dummy to the gravity regression like in Caron et al. (2014). The second is one with constant home bias but trade costs that differ for foreign and domestic trade (“border-sensitive trade costs”).====We estimate each version of our extended gravity equation and find that the income and the price-elasticities are highly sensitive to the model specification due to the different role of intra-national flows in the parameter identification. AIDS preferences generate an expenditure equation in which the dependent variable is an expenditure share – and not the logarithm of expenditure as is common in the international trade literature. This functional form and the fact that expenditures on domestic goods far exceed those on foreign goods give domestic observations a strong influence on the parameter estimates. In this context, the exact assumptions about the determinants of domestic spending take on an important role.====The large differences in parameter estimates across models translate into different distributions of the welfare gains from trade across income groups. The specification of Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) generates gains from trade that are biased towards the poor, and so does our first extension that introduces a constant home bias. The other two model specifications imply rather equally distributed gains from trade. For many countries, the most flexible model even predicts rich consumers to benefit relatively more once we introduce different trade costs for domestic and foreign trade or heterogeneity in the home bias. One of the main reasons for these different conclusions is the implied different ranking of countries in terms of their associated income elasticity of exports.====We perform a number of additional exercises, using alternative data or extending our analysis to a multi-sector framework. These confirm a change in the strength or the shape of the pro-poor bias of international trade when introducing a flexible home bias in preferences, but especially point to the instability of the welfare conclusions.====We contribute to the vast literature on the welfare gains from trade (see Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare (2014) for an overview) and more specifically to the strand studying how those gains vary across the income distribution due to non-homothetic consumption. The paper we are most closely related to is of course Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016). In a similar spirit, Nigai (2016) emphasizes the role of consumer heterogeneity in income for quantifying the welfare gains from trade with Stone-Geary preferences. Borusyak and Jaravel (2021) and Carroll and Hur (2020) investigate the heterogeneous welfare gains from trade through the expenditure channel along with welfare gains through the income channel. See also Atkin (2021) for a recent literature review. Some works, such as Porto (2006) or Broda and Romalis (2009), take a more micro and less structural perspective to examine the impact of trade on the prices of goods consumed by rich or poor households.====Our extension of the Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) setup builds on an extensive literature that studies the home bias and its causes (see Caron et al. (2014)). A home bias in taste serves as an explanation for the empirical failure of the standard Heckscher-Ohlin-model (Trefler (1995) and Davis and Weinstein (2001)), and is a common ingredient of quantitative models in international macroeconomics (e.g. Gali and Monacelli (2005) among many others). Recent papers have also identified home biases empirically (e.g. Morey (2016), Coşar et al. (2018) or Atkin (2013) through habit formation). Related to our work, Zhang (2020) introduces a role for migrants' taste in the setup of Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) to explain the variation in home bias across countries.====A high domestic expenditure may also result from relatively high costs of trading across borders, a standard interpretation of the border effect identified by McCallum (1995). Gravity estimates on data that include domestic flows often allow for a dummy variable on international flows (Fally, 2015), sometimes with an exporter-specific coefficient to match the lower trade openness of poorer countries (Waugh (2010), Caron et al. (2014)). The effect of distance on trade costs may also differ depending on the nature of the flow (inter vs. intranational) and on the country considered. Ramondo et al. (2016) model how domestic trade costs vary across countries and highlight their role for different outcomes including welfare in gravity-like setups. In a recent survey of the literature, Yotov (2021) points to the importance of including domestic trade flows in gravity estimations and of properly accounting for them (see also Yotov (2012), Borchert and Yotov (2017), Anderson et al. (2018)). We relate to that literature by emphasizing the key role played by domestic trade flows in an AIDS gravity model, due to their disproportionate size. Our focus is however on a different outcome, namely their role for the distributional effects of trade within countries.====Our discussion about log-log or share-log specifications in international trade relates to Novy (2013), who compares the performance of the translog to the constant elasticity of substitution gravity equations. The translog demand system is a special case of the AIDS when preferences are homothetic. We add to Novy (2013) by addressing the sensitivity of the translog gravity estimates to potential outliers in the data, in our case domestic trade. See also Feenstra and Weinstein (2017), Feenstra (2018) and Arkolakis et al. (2019) for recent work with translog demand in international trade.====Closely related is Anderson and Zhang (2020) who extend the model of Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) with the aim of explaining the large number of zero trade flows. They introduce variable price elasticities to the Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) model and add a uniform border effect to the set of trade costs proxies. Similar to our model specification featuring a homogeneous home bias, their set up addresses the special role of internal trade flows in the identification of the price elasticity but not in the identification of income elasticities. Finally, our analysis can also be of interest for papers which build on Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016), for example Liu and Meissner (2019) and Sager (2019).====The structure of our paper is as follows. In Section 2, we extend the AIDS model of Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) to allow for a home bias in preferences and more flexible trade costs. Section 3 presents the parameter estimates and the way they are identified in the different model specifications. Section 4 computes the welfare gains across the income distribution in the different versions of the model. In Section 5, we conduct additional analyses with a different data set and investigate the multi-sector setting of the model. Section 6 concludes.","Trade costs, home bias and the unequal gains from trade",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001167,23 September 2022,2022,Research Article,52.0

They account for a part of the co-movement of German and US government bond yields around Fed policy announcements, and for most of this co-movement around ECB policy announcements. Consequently, ECB surprise ==== hikes that spill over to US government bond yields reflect good news and are followed on average by easier, not tighter, US financial conditions and an economic expansion. In fact, they spill over similarly as positive European ==== news surprises. By contrast, pure ECB “monetary policy shocks” do not spill over, in part because of the offsetting Fed policy stance.","The yields on the US and German government bonds often co-move on the days when the Fed or the ECB announce their policy decisions. This is one manifestation of the transatlantic spillovers of monetary policies through integrated financial markets. A large literature documents that when the Fed hikes its interest rate, financial conditions tighten and the economic activity declines also outside of the US borders (Rey, 2013; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2020, and many others). But, as repeatedly pointed out by the Fed officials, the Fed is not the only central bank whose actions affect global financial markets (e.g. Powell, 2018; Clarida, 2021). US and European government bond yields co-move also around ECB policy announcements (e.g. Curcuru et al., 2018). However, the empirical evidence on the effects of ECB policies on the US is often counter-intuitive and the published literature on it is scarce.====This paper dissects an empirical puzzle that has plagued this research. It shows that an ECB interest rate hike that spills over across the Atlantic is followed by an easing, not a tightening, of the US financial conditions and an expansion of economic activity. This paper argues that the evidence is consistent with a weak transatlantic spillover of the ECB monetary policies and a strong transatlantic spillover of the ECB information effects. The latter mean that investors facing a positive interest rate surprise infer that the ECB is more bullish about the economy than they expected and this makes them more bullish as well (Romer and Romer, 2000; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018). In fact, as this paper shows, when the US financial variables respond to ECB interest rate hikes, their response is similar to their response to unexpectedly positive euro area macroeconomic data releases.====I first document that the transatlantic spillovers of ECB interest rate surprises are conditional on the co-movement of European interest rates and stock prices. Not all ECB interest rate surprises generate a persistent, same-sign effect on the US Treasury yields. It is only those that are associated with a positive co-movement of European interest rates and stock prices. Hence, these transatlantic spillovers cannot be driven by ECB monetary policy shocks, which would have driven these two variables in the opposite directions. I construct proxies for ECB monetary policy and information shocks based on the high-frequency co-movement of interest rates and stock prices in the wake of policy announcements, following Jarociński and Karadi (2020). It is the ECB information shocks that spill over to the Treasury yields.====Next, I study the responses of other US variables to ECB shocks using daily event study regressions and monthly vector autoregressions (VARs). The ECB information shocks significantly affect a range of US financial variables, including stock prices, corporate bond spreads and the dollar exchange rate, also against currencies other than the euro, and are eventually followed by stronger US real activity and higher prices.====For a comparison, I estimate the transatlantic spillovers of selected European macroeconomic news surprises, defined as the differences between the actual data releases and their earlier expectations from Bloomberg surveys of professional forecasters. I find that the US financial markets respond to an ECB information shock similarly as they do to an unexpectedly high reading of the European industrial confidence or an unexpectedly low European unemployment rate.====I show that the responses of the US stock prices are not driven by companies doing business with Europe. Predominantly US-exposed companies respond no less. The stocks that respond the most to ECB information shocks are those that are particularly sensitive to general investor sentiment: financial stocks and small stocks (Baker and Wurgler, 2006).====Finally, using the same methodology and variables I study the effects of the Fed shocks on the euro area. I find similar transatlantic spillovers of the Fed information shocks in the monthly VAR. In the case of the Fed I also find strong spillovers of the monetary policy shock, consistently with the consensus in the literature.====These results reconcile two facts. On the one hand, research finds that the transatlantic financial spillovers work both ways, also from Europe to the US. The already mentioned paper by Curcuru et al. (2018) documents a positive co-movement of long-term US Treasury and German bund yields on the days of ECB policy announcements. For another example, Ehrmann et al. (2011) find significant spillovers of European shocks to the US across several asset classes. On the other hand, there is a dearth of published evidence on the effects of ECB policy on the US risky asset prices and financial conditions, while some papers note in passing that these effects appear puzzling (e.g. Rogers et al., 2014; Brusa et al., 2020). Most of the literature on the international spillovers of ECB monetary policies focuses on the non-eurozone European countries (e.g. Bluwstein and Canova, 2016; Moder, 2019; Feldkircher et al., 2020; ter Ellen et al., 2020; Corsetti et al., 2021), on specific subsets of monetary policy interventions (Georgiadis and Gräb, 2016), or both.====This paper shows that it is exactly those ECB surprises that generate information effects at home, according to the Jarociński and Karadi (2020) decomposition, that are responsible for the bulk of the transatlantic spillovers. Hence, the response of US financial variables to these ECB surprises is not puzzling. It is similar to the effect of other European macroeconomic news.====What is more puzzling is the weak spillover of the ECB monetary policy to the US. This weak spillover is likely to result from a combination of two factors. First, the ECB monetary policy shocks have a smaller direct effect on the US economy than the other European shocks. Second, the Fed offsets the ECB monetary policy shocks more effectively. The first observation is intuitive, if we think of the other European shocks as containing a combination of a purely European shock (say, a wage bargaining round by trade unions in France) and a global shock (say, a global commodity supply shock). Such a combined shock will affect both those US companies that do business with Europe and those that do not. By contrast, an ECB monetary policy shocks affects directly only the US companies that do business with Europe. This intuition is consistent with this paper's findings on the responses of Europe-exposed vs US-exposed US stocks. The second observation is intuitive if we consider that the ECB monetary policy shock is a shock to financial conditions and the Fed is particularly well equipped to offset its effect on the US financial conditions, given that the role of the dollar as an investing and funding currency dwarfs that of the euro (Rey, 2016). In fact, this is what the Fed seems to be doing: indicators of Fed policy stance, such as the effective fed funds rates, shadow fed funds rates and US Treasury yields, fall in response to contractionary ECB monetary policy shocks.====The aforementioned large literature that documents strong international spillovers of the Fed's monetary policy includes also Kim (2001); Maćkowiak (2007); Georgiadis (2016); Ha (2016); Dedola et al. (2017); Gerko and Rey (2017); Degasperi et al. (2021) and many others. The literature on central bank information effects goes back to Romer and Romer (2000).

In addition, a large body of empirical work has traced variation in emerging economy spreads and default risk to both domestic and global factors.==== Motivated by this work, the sovereign default literature provides a framework in which time varying default probabilities generate endogenous variation in sovereign yields.==== However, this literature has emphasized the role of domestic factors with little attention to the global interlinkages highlighted by the empirical work.==== Our paper addresses this gap by focusing on the relationship between uncertainty in the world interest rate and sovereign default risk, while also retaining a role for domestic factors. Our focus on variation in the world interest rate as a global factor is consistent with several studies. For example, González-Rozada and Yeyati (2008) finds that movements in US treasuries as well as in proxies for global risk explain about half of the long run volatility in emerging economy interest rates.====Some recent episodes highlight the importance of the behavior of US interest rates for world debt markets. A notorious example, usually referred to as the “taper tantrum,” occurred in May of 2013 when former US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke suggested the possibility of a reduction in future bond purchases by the Fed. This triggered a sharp market adjustment in emerging market economies featuring a reversal in capital flows and a spike in government bond yields. On average, sovereign yields across emerging economies rose by 1% (Rai and Suchanek, 2014). An example of policy makers' dislike of uncertainty about the world interest rate occurred in 2015, as summarized by the following quotes reported in the Financial Times (September 9, 2015):====Motivated both by the empirical evidence on the importance of global factors in the movement of emerging economies' sovereign spreads as well as recent events and policy makers' concerns, we develop an equilibrium model of sovereign default (in the tradition of Eaton and Gersovitz, 1981) to study the relationship between endogenous country spreads and movements in both the level and the volatility of the world interest rate. To do so, we introduce stochastic volatility into the process of the world interest rate (following Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2011) in an otherwise standard quantitative model of long term sovereign debt (as in Hatchondo and Martinez, 2009). We use the model to quantify the role that shocks to the world interest rate play in explaining variation in sovereign spreads and the borrowing levels chosen by the sovereign, as well as the cross-country correlation in borrowing costs induced by the world interest rate process.====Our model implies that the impact of shocks to the world interest rate are highly state contingent and depend on income and existing debt levels, as well as on the state of world interest itself (its level and volatility). We find that on average the spread response is 1.4 times the increase in the world interest rate when volatility and the debt level are held constant at their means. This ‘slope’ increases to 6.4 when volatility state is high (4 standard deviations above mean) and falls to 0.8 when volatility is low (4 standard deviations below mean). Not surprisingly, a higher debt level makes the spread response to the world interest rate stronger and below-average debt lowers the response. Interestingly, these ‘spread slopes’ are in line with the empirical evidence (a spread slope of roughly 1), presented in Foley-Fisher and Guimaraes (2013) and Arora and Cerisola (2001). We also find that debt issuance declines when the world interest rate rises and this responsiveness is higher in the high volatility state as compared to the low volatility state.====Since our model can be viewed as a mechanism that transmits shocks in the process for the world interest rate into fluctuations in default probabilities and hence in sovereign spreads, we can use the model to infer how much cross-country co-movement in spreads is generated by this “global factor.” We find that when two economies (with income processes as correlated as in the data) face a constant world interest rate, their sovereign yields display a low correlation (0.17 and insignificant). However, if they face a common time-varying process for the world interest rate the co-movement between their sovereign yields increases significantly: the correlation is now 0.40 and significant. This is close to the mean correlation observed in the data (0.53).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the model and defines the equilibrium. Section 4 discusses the numerical solution and the calibration. Section 5 presents the results and Section 6 concludes.

We extend the ==== model of Sudden Stops of ==== allowing for non-homothetic preferences to generate this difference. Analytic results for an endowment economy show that, during crises, the non-homotheticity amplifies the decrease in the demand for the nontradable good, triggering a sharper deflation spiral that ultimately leads to a more severe current account reversal. The amplified pecuniary externality calls for more aggressive debt ====. An extended version of the model with production and permanent productivity shocks shows that non-homothetic preferences can also amplify the credit booms that precede Sudden Stops. The amplification is particularly large when the consumption boom is biased toward nontradable goods. Macroprudential policy shows, not only quantitative, but also qualitative differences in its reaction to shocks under preference non homotheticity.","Financial crises in open economies are characterized by large reversals of capital inflows and sharp currency depreciations. Interestingly, most of these crises are preceded by rapid expansions of credit and appreciated currencies (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2011, Schularick and Taylor, 2012). Not every credit boom leads to a crisis, but practically every crisis in emerging markets is preceded by one (Mendoza and Terrones, 2008). This pattern is systematic, as not only do credit booms predict crises, but larger booms are strongly associated with deeper recessions, larger capital outflows, and deeper real exchange rate depreciations (Jordà, 2013).====International finance theory has resorted to pecuniary externalities to generate boom-bust cycles of credit. In these settings, agents face income fluctuations and borrowing constraints that are a function of the endogenous value of their collateral. Agents do not internalize that when the debt-fueled consumption boom ends, the prices, and hence the value of their collateral, falls, triggering a binding constraint and a deflationary spiral that generate busts. By adopting homothetic preferences, the quantitative literature implicitly assumes that credit booms increase the expenditure of tradable and nontradable goods proportionally to their relative prices. Nevertheless, expenditure elasticities vary widely across goods (Aguiar and Bils, 2015, Hubmer, 2018), with tradable goods being less expenditure-elastic (Saffie et al., 2020). Because of the central role of the price of nontradable goods in these models, heterogeneous expenditure elasticity between goods can have important quantitative implications for financial crises dynamics and policy design.====We show that a simple extension from Bianchi (2011) can accommodate heterogeneity in expenditure elasticities. In particular, we deviate from the canonical constant elasticity of substitution aggregator to adopt a non-homothetic aggregator between the two goods. To introduce non-homotheticity, we take advantage of recent developments on the structural change literature (Boppart, 2014, Comin et al., 2021) and model heterogeneous expenditure elasticities in a parsimonious framework.====We first analyze an endowment economy subject to tradable income shocks under perfect foresight to derive three analytic results. First, the relative price of nontradable goods–a sufficient statistic for the real exchange rate in the economy–falls more during Sudden Stops under non-homothetic preferences, further tightening the borrowing constraint and magnifying the collapse of tradable consumption during financial crises. Second, for a given level of pre-crisis income, the amplification of crises in the non-homothetic economy (with respect to the standard homothetic model) is nonmonotonic in the size of the crisis. Medium-sized income declines that trigger financial crises exhibit the largest amplification. Third, for a given negative shock triggering a crisis, the higher the level of tradable consumption before the crisis is, the larger the amplification of crises in the non-homothetic economy–with respect to the standard homothetic model–becomes. These results point to a larger pecuniary externality fueled by the heterogeneous expenditure elasticity between tradable and nontradable goods. From a normative point of view, we use the social planner's problem to fully characterize how the degree on non-homotheticity amplifies the standard pecuniary externality in Bianchi (2011).====To illustrate the quantitative relevance of incorporating non-homotheticity when studying financial crises, we study a calibrated version of the stochastic endowment model that generates the empirical gap in expenditure elasticities between tradable and nontradable goods. All three theoretical predictions derived under perfect foresight are confirmed by the stochastic model. From a quantitative perspective, the average financial crisis under non-homothetic preferences triggers a 14% larger decrease in the price of nontradable goods, a 9% larger decrease in tradable consumption, and a 3 percentage point larger current account reversal. The optimal tax designed by the planner is 66 basis points larger under non-homotheticity, showing that the amplification of the pecuniary externality is quantitatively important.====The endowment model is the simplest possible setup that showcases the economic relevance of heterogeneous expenditure elasticities when studying financial crises. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence shows that large booms are typically intensive in nontradable expenditures such as housing (Di Maggio and Kermani, 2017) and that consumption booms tilted toward nontradable goods are typically more severe (Dell’Ariccia et al., 2020). In order to study how non-homotheticity affects the size and composition of credit booms, we extend the endowment model in two dimensions. First, akin to Arce et al. (2022), we include production and sector-specific transitory productivity shocks to allow for endogenous changes in the production basket. Second, similarly to Seoane and Yurdagul (2019) and Flemming et al. (2019), we extend the model to accommodate co-integrated permanent shocks to productivity in both sectors. The inclusion of growth rate shocks is a parsimonious alternative to generate sizable consumption booms.====We calibrate the extended model and benchmark it against its homothetic counterpart. Three main results arise from this exercise. First, the non-homothetic economy amplifies not only the busts but also the booms that precede crises. The median borrowing boom in the non-homothetic economy is 1.3 percentage points larger when compared to its homothetic counterpart. During the boom, the non-homothetic economy tilts its expenditure relatively more toward the nontradable good, causing labor to flow toward nontradable production. To finance the larger trade deficit, the non-homothetic economy borrows relatively more during the boom. Thus, when the crisis materializes, the non-homothetic economy experiences a more severe bust. The second result shows that the composition of the consumption boom matters for amplification. In fact, the boom and bust amplification is larger for financial crises that were preceded by consumption booms where the basket was tilted toward nontradable consumption. Third, we study optimal policy when the social planner has access to a single policy instrument in the form of a debt tax. Similarly to the endowment economy, macroprudential policy is on average more aggressive under non-homothetic preferences. By comparing the optimal tax in both economies we show that the amplification of the pecuniary externality is larger in periods characterized by positive permanent shocks. From a macroprudential policy perspective, while debt taxes decrease with favorable stationary nontradable-productivity shocks in an homothetic economy, the same shocks trigger higher taxes when preferences are non-homothetic. This result has important implications as it suggests that macroprudential policy should be more active when booms are driven by nontradable shocks (e.g., housing booms).====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the endowment economy, derives the main results under perfect foresight, defines the social planner's problem, and characterizes the amplification of the pecuniary externality that arises under non-homotheticity. Section 3 calibrates the model, quantifies the theoretical predictions, and studies optimal policy. Section 4 studies the extended model that features production and permanent productivity shocks. Finally, Section 5 concludes and suggests future avenues of work.",Non-homothetic sudden stops,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219962200112X,30 August 2022,2022,Research Article,56.0

Crisis shocks reduce the supply of cross-border liquidity, with stronger volume than pricing effects. On the extensive margin, results suggest that the cross-border ==== is independent of borrower quality, while—on the intensive margin—riskier borrower banks suffer more. Moreover, the cross-border liquidity crunch is substantially stronger for term loans, and weaker for foreign lender banks that have a subsidiary in the same country than the borrower. Finally, nonstandard ==== improves interbank liquidity, but without fostering strong re-integration of cross-border ====.","In stark contrast to historical systemic crises that were mainly plagued by retail runs, the global financial crisis—that started with the Lehman Brothers' failure on September 15, 2008, and intensified in the euro area after April 2010 with the sovereign debt crisis—was largely characterized by a reduction in wholesale funding liquidity (Freixas et al., 2015). The last global crisis is however not different in key aspects with historical crises. Jordà et al. (2011) and Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) show that financial crises tend to follow periods of strong private credit financed partly with foreign liquidity, and one important outcome of the last global financial crisis has been a geographic fragmentation of international liquidity in global financial markets, partially unwinding the trend in financial globalization that occurred since the mid-1980s (Broner et al., 2013a, Broner et al., 2013b; IMF, 2013). To combat this recent crisis, central banks have mainly responded using nonstandard monetary policies (Draghi, 2013; Stein, 2014).====In this paper, we offer an in-depth analysis of how the recent Lehman and sovereign debt crises affect cross-border interbank liquidity, including whether the new, expansionary nonstandard monetary policy actions may help to re-integrate money market disruptions.==== Despite the utmost importance of this question for scholars and policymakers, empirical analysis is scarce, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive micro-datasets—especially on cross-border liquidity—since wholesale credit transactions are mostly over-the-counter trades. Comprehensive micro-credit datasets, however, are necessary both to control for borrower fundamentals (e.g. foreigner banks may lend to different local borrowers than domestic lenders) and to examine heterogeneity in cross-border versus domestic loan terms. In this paper, we use new lender-borrower transaction-level data from the euro area interbank market, derived from its interbank payment system Target2, and hence we analyze cross-border interbank lending during key crises.====The strengths of these data are various. First, different from other loan data, we can compare, for otherwise ==== loans to the same borrower on the same day, the volume and spread of a foreign vs. a domestic lender. In other credit markets, loans among different lenders to the same borrower are not granted on the same day (thus the borrower's risk is different) and have different maturities, currencies, or collateral; however, in interbank markets, if one exploits the data on (standard, plain vanilla) overnight loans in the central-bank payment system, one can avoid this problem. Hence, not only is analyzing the interbank wholesale market key for studying recent financial and sovereign debt crises, but it is also key for identifying the effects of crises on cross-border liquidity. Second, as compared to the global financial market, the euro area is a single currency union and with a bank-dominated economy. In contrast to the U.S. interbank data, we can study the cross-border dimension—which is the question that we address in this paper—and our database also provides us with identifiers for interbank credit transactions and the ultimate borrower and lender banks involved in the loan, all of which are crucial for identification. Moreover, the euro area had risks associated with various countries' sovereign debt, which gives our data larger cross-sectional and time variation in crisis shocks. Finally, before the Eurosystem's announcement of quantitative easing in January 2015, the Eurosystem pursued several new and nonstandard monetary policies whose main effects centered on its banking system, given the importance of banks in the European financial and economic system (Praet, 2016).====To identify the impact of financial crises on lending terms across borders as compared to domestically, we restrict the Target2 dataset interbank overnight loans. We analyze loans granted to the same borrower on the same day, thus controlling for time-varying unobserved borrower fundamentals, thereby isolating differential (lender)bank-to-(borrower)bank loan conditions (access, volume, and spread) by domestic versus foreign lenders (abstracting from other loan differences such as, e.g., maturity and currency). This empirical strategy implies—in the intensive and extensive margin of lending—analyzing the data at the ==== level and adding borrower*day fixed effects. To further control for time-varying creditor bank conditions (e.g., liquidity hoarding or differently affected by the crisis) and for time-invariant lender-borrower bank relations (e.g., similar business models), we can add lender*day and lender*borrower fixed effects. Moreover, in conjunction with the euro area interbank data, we exploit both the Lehman failure and the sovereign debt shocks. We analyze separately the Lehman collapse and the sovereign debt crisis, as the former is more bank-related and the latter is more dependent on sovereign risk, especially in countries rescued by the Troika (an ECB-EU-IMF bailout to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, or to Spain's banking sector, the ==== countries).====For both shocks, we not only identify the impact of the financial and sovereign debt crises events on cross-border loan conditions, but we also provide suggestive evidence on the role of asymmetric information problems behind potential changes in cross-border liquidity during crises. Our results are, however, suggestive, as we cannot empirically account for the individual interaction between any bank's incentives to run its business activities and the member state's national interest (e.g., Bolton and Oehmke, 2019). In our analysis, we examine whether there is a differential effect of domestic versus cross-border depending on whether the foreign lender has a subsidiary in the borrower bank's country, and hence has better information as compared to a foreign lender without a subsidiary in that country. Moreover, we also analyze whether term loans behave differently than overnight loans as the banking literature suggests that the former ones are more affected by information problems. In addition, we study the role of (observed and unobserved) risk characteristics of the borrower bank. As a measure for observable borrower characteristics, we use an identifier for GIPS-headquartered borrowing banks, as these countries were at the core of the European sovereign debt crisis.==== As a proxy for unobserved borrower-specific risk, we use average past loan-level interest rates that the borrower paid in the OTC-market for interbank overnight loans during the month prior to the immediate trade (‘high-spread borrower’, hereafter). This variable captures all information that interbank lenders use when pricing overnight loans, and it is thus a more comprehensive measure than balance sheet or location information to assess the role of borrower-level risk for the extensive and intensive margin of credit during crises times.==== Finally, we analyze the role of nonstandard monetary policy in affecting the interbank liquidity supply, especially to the cross-border segment.====Our robust findings suggest that financial crisis shocks reduce the supply of interbank liquidity on both the extensive and intensive margins, exerting a substantially stronger negative effect for cross-border loans. Specifically, when comparing the same borrower bank on the same day, the foreign lender is less likely to grant an interbank loan than the domestic lender as the crisis intensifies. Conditioning on granting the overnight loan, the foreign lender reduces the loan amount and increases the loan spread. During the worst part of each crisis event, compared to the domestic lender, the foreign lender reduces access to the same borrower on the same day by 29% during the Lehman crisis and by 24% during sovereign debt crisis, and reduces volume by 12% and by 10%, respectively. Moreover, the impairment of cross-border liquidity is substantially stronger for volumes than pricing. Cross-border spreads further increase by 7 basis points during the Lehman shock; during the sovereign crisis, cross-border spreads only increase for GIPS-headquartered bank borrowers.====In the extensive margin (access to interbank liquidity), we find in both crisis periods that the reduction of the supply of cross-border liquidity is independent of observed and unobserved borrower bank characteristics.==== These results suggest that the cross-border crunch during crisis times in the extensive margin is independent of borrower bank risk and quality, i.e. the flight home is independent of flight to quality.====Differently, once a cross-border loan is granted, borrower risk characteristics matter for the volume and spread (intensive margin). In particular, within the cross-border segment, there is further heterogeneity depending on the risk of borrower banks. Interestingly, during the Lehman crisis, comparing with other cross-border borrower banks, high-risk borrower banks pay up to 15 basis points higher spreads for cross-border (as opposed to domestic) liquidity. During the sovereign debt crisis, however, GIPS-headquartered borrower banks obtain substantially smaller cross-border loan amounts (reduction of up to 38%), in addition to paying higher spreads on these international loans (up to 14 basis points).====Consistent with theories about the presence of asymmetric information problems across borders (e.g., Freixas and Holthausen, 2005), we show that the documented cross-border liquidity crunch during crises is driven by a reduction of lending by foreign banks that are located in a different country than the borrowing bank (foreign lender banks are banks controlled by parents of different nationality than the borrower bank's parent and without a subsidiary in the borrower country). In contrast, we do not find a robust contraction in liquidity supply by foreign banks that are located in the same country than the borrowing bank; instead, those foreign banks behave similarly to domestic banks. Moreover, we show that, after Lehman's failure, term lending volumes experience a very strong and sudden collapse by up to 80% (our results do not suggest that borrower banks in the term market are riskier than in the overnight market). Importantly, and consistent with asymmetric information problems as a key driver, the term liquidity freeze was more pronounced for cross-border loans on all margins of credit. For example, we find in the first two weeks after Lehman's failure an additional reduction in cross-border term loan volumes of up to 52% relative to overnight loans. Interestingly this crunch has not recovered until the end of our sample.====Finally, we find that expansionary nonstandard monetary policy partly mitigates interbank liquidity restrictions during crisis periods, but this public policy has limitations in fostering strong re-integration of cross-border interbank markets. For identification, we use a short time window (±1 week) to measure the effects around the three main expansionary monetary policy measures enacted over our sample period: during the Lehman crisis, (i) the fixed-rate full allotment (FRFA), and during the sovereign debt crisis, (ii) the first two 3-year long-term refinancing operations (LTROs), (iii) and Draghi's “whatever-it-takes” speech, including the related outright monetary transactions (OMT) program (ECB, 2008; Draghi, 2012a). Exploiting the impact of these monetary policy changes on cross-border versus domestic loans, we find that all three measures improve more the supply of cross-border loans in the extensive margin, compared to domestic lending, but not in the intensive margin.==== For example, all three expansionary monetary policies reduce the interbank rates for all loans, but with a similar effect on domestic and cross-border loans (despite that the crisis shocks were more negative on the cross-border segment). In addition, effects are similar for riskier banks (e.g., highly-leveraged GIPS-borrowers). Moreover, the OMT policy—both the Draghi speech and the announcement by the Eurosystem—has positive effects on (private) interbank liquidity despite that there was no actual injection of public liquidity, i.e., just the suggested possibility that this policy tool might be used.","Cross-border interbank liquidity, crises, and monetary policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000897,29 August 2022,2022,Research Article,57.0

Using micro-data on the universe of French manufacturing exporters over 1995–2007, I show that a measure of export demand growth exogenous to firm-level outcomes drives down the manufacturing labor share through two effects. First, foreign demand shocks allow low-labor share, highly internationalized “superstar” exporters to grow disproportionately more. Second, foreign demand growth decreases the labor share of exporters and this effect is stronger for larger exporters. Both effects generate a sizable labor share decline, regardless of aggregate labor share dynamics. A simple heterogeneous-firm model with endogenous markups rationalizes my empirical results. Overall, these findings provide direct causal evidence of a “winner take most” phenomenon induced by trade globalization and emphasize the role of increased competition on international markets for labor share changes.","The manufacturing value-added labor share has experienced changes in several OECD countries in recent decades.==== This phenomenon casts doubt on the future of work and its value.==== The causes of the evolution of the labor share, however, remain uncertain. While international trade has been put forward as an explanation for labor share changes, the only mechanism highlighted in the literature is increased ==== exposure (Elsby et al., 2013). It is likely that the ==== side of trade, which refers to changes in demand conditions on foreign markets,==== also causes changes in the manufacturing labor share. On the one hand, an increase in foreign demand could increase or decrease the labor share of firms depending on the relative response of labor compensation and value-added. On the other hand, an increase in foreign demand could favor firms with a low labor share, decreasing the aggregate labor share through compositional changes. Indeed, in a recent paper, Autor et al. (2020) show that the labor share decline is explained by the rise of “superstar firms”, which have a low labor share. However, the precise origins behind the reallocation of sales towards large players remain to be uncovered. In this article, I use detailed micro-data on the universe of French exporters over 1995–2007 to highlight a new trade determinant of changes in the manufacturing labor share and show that it generates reallocation forces as hypothesized by Autor et al. (2020).====The contribution of the article is threefold. First, I provide causal empirical evidence that an increase in foreign demand decreases the labor share at home through two effects. Foreign demand growth generates intensive margin reallocations towards low-labor share, more internationalized “superstar” exporters (====-exporter effect). Foreign demand growth also drives down exporters' labor share and the effect is ==== for superstar exporters (====-exporter effect). Importantly, my framework makes it possible to disentangle the effect of foreign demand shocks from other firm-level changes affecting a firm's growth rate and its labor share, such as automation, outsourcing and offshoring. Second, I provide some back-of-the-envelope calculation to assess the magnitude of both between and within-exporter effects. This exercise sheds quantitative light on the effect of export demand on the labor share. Third, I investigate the channels behind the labor share changes and show that the results are consistent with increased competition on international markets. My findings thus point to a previously unexplored dimension of labor share changes and establish a direct causation link with the “winner take most” mechanism of Autor et al. (2020).====Using French balance-sheet and customs data over 1995–2007, I document three facts for the manufacturing sector. First, the labor share experiences different changes over the long-run: it decreases before 2000 and increases after that year.==== Importantly, the fact that the labor share exhibits diverging trends over the period considered allows me to show that the micro mechanism I identify systematically drives down the labor share regardless of underlying aggregate changes. Second, decomposing the change in the labor share into a within-exporter, between-exporter and entry-exit margin,==== I find that the reallocation of output towards low labor share exporters drives down the labor share, consistent with recent evidence for the US (Autor et al., 2020; Kehrig and Vincent, 2018). Interestingly, the within component increases over the period, driving up the aggregate labor share. Third, I show that more internationalized exporters have a lower labor share, especially those that sell more internationally. Taken jointly, these facts suggest that a reallocation of value-added towards superstar exporters generated by export demand shocks has the potential to generate changes in the aggregate labor share. Moreover, the use of good-quality micro data for France provides additional external validity to the existence of a reallocation effect towards low-labor share firms.====Empirically, I study whether foreign demand growth impacts the value-added growth rate of firms and their labor share differently depending on their degree of internationalization.==== To do so, I rely on a shift-share identification strategy. The foreign demand measure uses the fact that firms initially have a different export basket and export different goods to different countries. Changes in imports from the rest of the world ==== France affect firms differently, depending on their initial exposure to foreign markets. This firm-level foreign demand measure is exogenous to firm-level decisions that could impact their growth rate or labor share, such as the decision to offshore, outsource or automate. The most important empirical finding is that the effect of foreign demand growth on exporters' value-added growth rate and labor share is heterogeneous. More specifically, I find that top sellers on international markets grow faster whereas less internationalized exporters shrink, following an increase in foreign demand. I also find that exporters experience a decrease in their labor share following an export demand shock, and this negative effect is magnified for top exporters. Although labor compensation increases with foreign demand, the labor share goes down because of the disproportionate rise of value-added. These results highlight the existence of intensive margin reallocations towards superstar exporters. The results do not appear to be driven by confounding factors such as automation, offshoring, outsourcing, by the choice of sample or specification, by the definition of superstar exporters, or by the existence of pre-trends.====Next, I examine the quantitative impact of export demand on the manufacturing labor share. Both between and within-exporter effects generate a 1.4 percentage point labor share decline over 1995–2007. This change is almost entirely driven by the within-exporter effect. Focusing on 1995–2000, I find that both effects explain 11.3% of the observed labor share decline. Over 2000–2007, both effects generate a 1.2 percentage point drop, implying that the observed labor share increase would have been stronger had export demand not risen. In exploring the importance of superstar exporters in driving the results, I further find that roughly half of the magnitude of the within-exporter effect is driven by larger exporters experiencing a stronger labor share decline and by the top 1% of superstar exporters. I further show that the heterogeneous response of exporters to foreign demand shocks is much more important in accounting for the within-firm effect than heterogeneous shocks. In other words, intensive margin reallocations towards large players on international markets are key to understanding the role played by export demand growth in shaping the aggregate labor share.====To understand why foreign demand shocks decrease firm-level labor shares and why superstar exporters experience a larger labor share decline, I rely on a monopolistic competition model with heterogeneous firms and endogenous competition. In the model, an increase in market size triggers a change in the competitive environment, forcing firms to adjust their markups. Since firms are heterogeneous, markup changes are heterogeneous across firms. When the price elasticity of demand decreases with consumption —a case long recognized to be the most plausible by Marshall (1890) and Krugman (1979), and commonly referred to as Marshall's Second Law of Demand (MSLD) —all firms experience a decrease in their markup as the environment becomes more competitive. However, larger firms adjust their markup relatively more than the others, allowing them to gain market shares and grow. In fact, the larger the firm, the larger its markup adjustment, the stronger its growth, consistent with my empirical findings. This entails that larger exporters experience a disproportionate increase in their sales which compensates for their markup adjustment. Since a firm's labor share depends on its markup and on its share of fixed labor costs in sales, the increase in sales —which dominates the decrease in markups —drives down the labor share of larger exporters. This result is amplified for superstar exporters as they grow relatively more. Overall, intensive margin reallocations have natural implications for labor share changes across firms, as in my empirical findings.","Labor share, foreign demand and superstar exporters",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001106,27 August 2022,2022,Research Article,58.0

The underlying reason is that firms have incentives to redeem their debt on demand to accommodate the potential liquidity needs of global investors, which makes international borrowing endogenously fragile. Based on a theoretical model and empirical evidence at both the firm and macro levels, our main findings are twofold. First, a significant association exists between surges and shortened corporate debt maturity, especially for firms with foreign bank relationships and higher redeployability. Second, the probability of a crisis following surges with a flattened yield curve is significantly higher than that following surges without one. Our study suggests that debt maturity is the key to understand the financial instability consequences of capital inflow bonanzas.","One of the open questions in the international finance literature is whether policymakers should restrict capital inflow windfalls. The benefits are apparent: foreign capital inflows can ease financial constraints (e.g., Laeven, 2003), promote productivity growth (e.g., Henry, 2003; Varela, 2018), and reduce domestic credit misallocation (e.g., Larrain and Stumpner, 2017). However, the potential costs are ambiguous. Although most capital inflow surges eventually end in a crisis (Ghosh et al., 2016), it is unclear why this happens, as the existing literature has not established a consensus on the underlying mechanism. As pointed out by Aromí (2021), the ignorance of the mechanism of surges results in weak guidance to policymakers and financial market practice on preventing the accompanying fragility. In addition, the 2008 global financial crisis and the global imbalance that preceded it showed that capital inflow surges could bring instability even to advanced economies. In the existing literature, possible explanations are excessive lending (Caballero, 2016) and asset price bubbles (Calvo, 2012; Aizenman and Jinjarak, 2009). This study shows that capital inflow surges destabilize the economy through a maturity shortening channel.====Specifically, this study consists of a simple theoretical model and then accompanying empirical analyses. We employ the model to explain why firms prefer issuing short-term debt during capital inflow surges and how this behavior affects some macro indicators, such as the yield curve and the probability of crises. The model discusses the firm's optimal choice in an environment where it can choose to borrow from global banks in either long-term debt or short-term demandable debt. The key friction comes from the liquidity mismatch between the borrower's asset liquidation costs and the lender's liquidity needs. With demandable debt, even before a project matures, banks can demand the liquidation value of corporate assets. Our model shows that firms have strong incentives to make debt demandable for international borrowing, because it is more attractive to global banks that face liquidity shocks. In other words, firms choose to issue demandable and short-term debt, especially when borrowing from global banks with potential liquidity needs, because the price advantage of demandability increases corporate debt capacity (Donaldson and Piacentino, 2022). Consequently, capital inflow surges with an endogenous shortening of corporate maturity. However, the increased demandability of corporate debt exposes domestic firms to possible debt runs, thus increasing aggregate financial instability. Our model implies a deep connection between capital inflow bonanzas and economic instability through the endogenous corporate maturity structure mechanism, which has three testable implications. First, capital inflow surges are associated with the shortening of corporate debt maturity. Second, cross-sectionally, firms with higher asset liquidation values and/or foreign bank relationships are more likely to borrow short-term debt from global investors. Third, surges with flattening yield curves are strong predictors of future financial crises.====Guided by these model predictions, we conduct an empirical study at both firm and macro levels to test whether the maturity shortening channel actually holds. In line with the literature, throughout our main analysis, surges are defined as episodes in which the detrended net capital inflows in real per capita terms are larger than one standard deviation.==== First, we use a cross-country firm-bank matched dataset to examine the effects of surges on corporate maturity structure and instability. Specifically, using a large sample of over one million firm-year observations, which mainly consists of private and small enterprises in seven European countries during surge episodes in the 1990s and the 2000s, we find that surges are significantly associated with an increase in the use of short-term debt, and this maturity shortening effect is significantly more pronounced for firms that have foreign bank lending relationships and higher redeployability. We document these findings by employing a difference-in-differences (DID) specification to compare corporate debt maturity structures for firms with and without foreign bank relationships in the six-year window around inflow surges. In addition, we conduct propensity score matching (PSM) to mitigate the concern that firms with and without foreign banks are endogenously different, and then provide DID results based on the matched sample. We find that firms with foreign bank relationships are significantly more likely to be affected by surges than firms with only domestic bank relationships. We further examine the impact on firm insolvency probability proxied by ====-score and find a significant decrease in soundness for firms with a shortened debt maturity after surges, compared to those with a lengthened maturity. We also provide robust checks using firm-level and loan-level data based on an alternative sample consisting mainly of listed firms, which allows the identification of time-variant firm-bank relationships and specific debt maturity length, and the results are robust. These firm-level empirical findings are consistent with the model's predictions. Furthermore, we discuss the heterogeneous impacts across different categories of credits and capital inflows.====Second, to test the macro implications, we turn to historical surge events to ascertain whether the debt maturity shortening channel can explain the heterogeneous responses of the aggregate probability of financial crisis across countries. Specifically, we exploit a long-run macrohistory dataset covering twelve countries from 1870 to 2016 compiled by Jordà et al. (2017). We find that the combination of a surge and a flattened yield curve is a strong predictor of future systemic financial crises. We use a conventional logit model to test whether surges increase the probability of systemic financial crises and distinguish between surges with and without a flattened yield curve. The unconditional probability of crises in Jordà et al. (2017)’s data sample is 3.4%, and we find that surges alone can increase the likelihood of a crisis to 11.0%. More importantly, the probability of crises significantly increases to 32.6% if surges are accompanied by a flattened yield curve. These findings prove the external validity of our argument that debt maturity shortening is important in the transmission of surges to financial instability.====Our maturity shortening story of international capital flows dates back to Rodrik and Velasco (1999), who also examined the impact of short-term capital flows on financial instability. They built a model using simultaneous determination of debt maturity and the term structure of interest rates to explain that short-term debt leaves borrowing countries vulnerable to sudden shifts in lender expectations. Our study is similar to that of Rodrik and Velasco (1999) in that it links short-term debt with vulnerability and crises; however, our study is different in the following ways. First, theoretically, our model shows that international borrowing is associated with maturity shortening because foreign investors need to bear more liquidity shocks. In contrast, in Rodrik and Velasco (1999)’s model, the costs of long-term debt depend on the expected probability of runs in the intermediate stages. However, whether firms actually use excessive short-term debt is unclear in their model because it depends on the extent to which lenders can distinguish among investors in the same country and the extent to which local investors internalize their behavior. Second, we use firm-level data to provide evidence of shortened corporate debt maturity and increased instability and further examine the heterogeneous effect based on redeployability. In contrast, Rodrik and Velasco (1999) utilized only country-level data on short-term capital flows and crises to test their theoretical model. Third, using matched firm-bank data, we focus on the role of relationships with foreign banks, which is the key characteristic we choose to identify the impacts of foreign credit booms compared with domestic ones. Another closely related study is that of Broner et al. (2013b), who argued that that emerging countries tend to borrow short-term debt because it is cheaper. However, our study differs from theirs in three aspects. First, they investigate sovereign debt, whereas we are interested in corporate debt. Second, their explanation is from the asset pricing perspective: emerging countries need to pay a higher risk premium on long-term than on short-term bonds. In contrast, our underlying model is based on the relationship between liquidity needs and short-term debt in the banking theory literature. Third, their model implies that the government issues shorter maturities during crises. However, we argue that debt maturity shortens during capital inflow surges, and the root of financial crises lies in these booms.====Considered together, our findings have important implications for policy and research. For policymakers concerned with the impacts of capital inflows on financial stability, our study reveals that the shape of the interest rate term structure is an important indicator that requires attention. International borrowing is likely to be associated with substantial changes in corporate maturity structure as global investors face an entirely different liquidity condition from local investors; therefore, policymakers should pay serious attention to capital inflow bonanzas with a flattening yield curve, which is a strongly informative predictor of future financial crises. Thus, we also contribute to the growing literature on optimal capital flow management policies (e.g., Korinek and Sandri, 2016; Das et al., 2022). Moreover, it is important for future theoretical studies attempting to investigate the macro-finance consequences of large capital inflows to consider the interest rate term structure and introduce endogenous debt maturity to the existing small open economy framework à la Uribe and Schmitt-Grohe (2017) and Croce et al. (2020).",Surges and instability: The maturity shortening channel,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001118,25 August 2022,2022,Research Article,59.0

Moreover, we show that potential transmission mechanisms include improved financing conditions, greater skilled labor utilization, and technology upgrades. Finally, we document heterogeneous effects across firm size and tradability, and threshold effects with respect to the country's institutional quality.","The precise impacts of capital account liberalization are still debated. Neoclassical growth models predict that international capital mobility will decrease the cost of capital and increase the level of investment, thereby boosting economic growth. However, empirical evidence on this is far from consistent. The extensive literature on the empirical relationship between capital account liberalization and economic growth provides, at best, mixed findings (Kose et al., 2009, Jeanne et al., 2012, Wei, 2018). Policy discussions have also shifted from promoting capital account openness to reimposing capital controls in the post-crisis periods; in addition, after the recent pandemic crisis, deglobalization concerns are growing. Some reasons behind the weak evidence on either benefits or costs of opening the capital account are the use of aggregate data that hide the heterogeneities and specific transmission mechanisms, and the less-explored impacts outside of capital accumulation, such as productivity.====This study examines the effect of capital account liberalization on productivity growth using firm-level data. This allows us to identify the heterogeneous effects across firms, and reveal the channels that link capital account liberalization and productivity growth. Using over three million firm-level observations in twelve Eastern European countries from 1995 to 2015, we find the following. First, a one standard deviation increase in the capital account openness indicator constructed by Fernández et al. (2016) is significantly associated with a 0.18 standard deviation increase in firms’ total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Notably, this positive association is significantly stronger for sectors with higher external finance dependence and capital-skill complementarity. In addition, a dynamic effect analysis shows that this productivity-enhancing effect is persistent. Second, potential transmission mechanisms of opening the capital account on firms’ productivity growth include improved financing conditions, greater skilled labor utilization, and the possibility of technology upgrade. Third, the direction and category of capital account liberalization matter. Specifically, the increase in TFP growth mainly comes from the liberalization of capital inflows, while that of outflows does not show a clear effect. In terms of asset category, bonds and foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalization are overall more beneficial to domestic firms’ productivity growth. Moreover, we document heterogeneous effects across firm size and tradability, and threshold effects with respect to the country's institutional quality.====Specifically, we first estimate the production function and obtain firm-level TFP measurements. In this process, we seek to mitigate the simultaneity issue and selection bias following techniques from Olley and Pakes (1996), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), Wooldridge (2009), and Ackerberg et al. (2015). Then, we regress firms’ TFP growth rate on the capital account openness indicator from Fernández et al. (2016), along with other controls. To examine the causality of the baseline correlation, we use sector-level external finance dependence and capital-skill complementarity to interact with capital account liberalization. The results show that the marginal effects of capital account openness on TFP growth are stronger if the firms are more dependent on external finance, and use more capital to complement skilled labor. In addition, we identify the exact year of liberalization for each country by finding the significant jump in the capital account openness indicator, and estimate the dynamic effect of liberalizing capital account on firm productivity growth. We observe a persistent productivity-enhancing effect, as the impact on TFP growth relative to the liberalizing year remains significantly positive five years later.====Next, we investigate three possible transmission channels – relaxed financing conditions, greater skilled labor utilization, and higher likelihood of technology upgrade – with respect to external finance dependence and capital-skill complementarity. We document that capital account liberalization is associated with improved financing conditions, represented by a significant increase in firms’ total debt amount. In addition, the results imply greater skilled labor utilization with more capital account openness, as the average wage increases significantly. Moreover, when we use investment spikes to capture technology upgrade or vintage change, we find that the probability of technology upgrades increases significantly after capital account liberalization.====Lastly, we extend the discussion to different directions and categories of capital account liberalization, the heterogeneity and threshold effects. Specifically, we find that it is the liberalization of capital inflows instead of outflows that drives the positive impact on productivity growth. In terms of asset types, the liberalization of bonds and FDI, in general, is more beneficial to domestic firms’ productivity growth. The effect of capital account liberalization is heterogeneous by firm size and tradability, as small firms and firms in non-tradable sectors tend to benefit more than large and tradable firms. Besides, when the country has a better institutional quality and domestic finance depth, liberalizing its capital account is associated with a higher increase in productivity growth. Finally, by decomposing the aggregate productivity growth into technical efficiency and reallocation effect, we show that within-firm technical efficiency gains are the dominant contributor and our findings of capital account liberalization on firm-level productivity growth are important for the aggregate growth.====In the appendix, we develop a small open economy model with heterogeneous entrepreneurs to investigate the impacts of financial globalization on firm-level productivity. Our key assumption is that firms need to purchase technology-related inputs to enhance their productivity but face credit market frictions. Capital account liberalization, modeled as a reduction in cost of capital, allows domestic firms to purchase more productivity-augmenting inputs and overcome the borrowing constraints, thereby improving firm-level TFP. Our model also provides additional cross-sectional predictions that are consistent with our empirical findings.",Total factor productivity growth at the firm-level: The effects of capital account liberalization,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001088,19 August 2022,2022,Research Article,60.0

Macroprudential policies, including capital controls (CC), try to tame excessive credit booms. Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008–2009, macroprudential policies have become increasingly popular among both academics and policymakers (Freixas et al., 2015) and their use has risen constantly (Claessens, 2015; Alam et al., 2019). Moreover, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has endorsed capital controls, initially as a temporary and last resort tool for managing credit booms led by large capital inflows (Blanchard, 2013; IMF (International Monetary Fund), 2012, IMF (International Monetary Fund), 2018; Ostry et al., 2010; Qureshi et al., 2011) and more recently also as a preemptive policy to mitigate risks from external debt (IMF, 2022). In the same spirit, a class of models rationalizes capital controls as a Pigouvian tax to reduce the negative externalities on systemic risk and aggregate demand due to excessive foreign debt (Benigno et al., 2016; Bianchi, 2011; Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2015; Jeanne and Korinek, 2010; Korinek, 2011, Korinek, 2018; Korinek and Sandri, 2016; Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2016). Other authors support capital controls based on the idea that controls insulate local monetary policy from shocks originated in global financial centers (Rey, 2015; Farhi and Werning, 2012, Farhi and Werning, 2014, Farhi and Werning, 2016; Davis and Presno, 2017).====In this paper, we study how capital controls and domestic macroprudential policy tame credit supply booms, either directly or by enhancing the local bank-lending channel of monetary policy. In particular, we focus on two research questions. First, we ask whether (and if so, how) CC on FX-financing strengthen the local bank-lending channel of monetary policy by increasing the pass-through of variations in the ==== monetary policy rate on domestic credit supply, and its implication on bank risk-taking. Second, we investigate the impact of domestic macroprudential measures, specifically reserve requirements (RR) on local household and firm deposits, on credit supply and risk-taking, including through the interaction with monetary policy rates. Moreover, answers to these questions play a pivotal role in understanding whether these two macroprudential policies operate through different channels by targeting either foreign or domestic bank liabilities, and mitigating risks stemming from excessive credit booms.====Our analysis exploits the simultaneous adoption of CC and tightening of RR by the Central Bank of Colombia on May 2007. The Central Bank enforced CC as a 40% ==== reserve requirement (URR) on FX debt inflows, borne by the borrower. At the time, local interest rates – as reflected by the overnight interbank rate – were as high as 8.4%. Hence, the new regulation resulted in high taxation of FX debt inflows as a large part (40%) of the inflows had to stay at the central bank for six months without any remuneration. Borrowers could withdraw the deposit before this deadline, but upon the payment of a heavy fee (decreasing in time and ranging from 9.4% of the deposit in the first month to 1.6% during the sixth and last month). Banks would bear CCs if FX funding served the purpose of financing peso investments (including lending).==== The Central Bank of Colombia lifted CC by October 2008, amid signs of an economic slowdown related to the unfolding of the GFC after Lehman Brothers' collapse. Regarding domestic macroprudential measures, in May 2007 the Central Bank of Colombia modified its traditional reserve requirements (RR) policy on peso-denominated deposits. In particular, the Central Bank introduced a ==== RR on bank deposits, on top of the ordinary reserve requirement, applied to the overall volume of new deposits received after May 7th, 2007. The marginal RR did not pay any remuneration (at a time of high local interest rates) and amounted to 27% of (the volume of new) checking deposits and to 12% of savings deposits, though the Central Bank eventually uniformed the RR to 27% for both savings and checking deposits by June 2007. The Central Bank removed the marginal RR in August 2008.====Identifying the repercussions of CC and RR on credit supply poses challenges, as such policies are not random, but rather induced by the credit boom, and influence both the demand and the supply of credit. To isolate supply motives, we employ a combination of granular administrative datasets, including loan-level data on commercial loans from the credit registry and supervisory bank balance sheet data. We identify credit supply by exploiting variation in loan conditions for the same firm in a given year:quarter, across banks with different exposure to either CC (ex-ante bank foreign FX funding) or RR (ex-ante domestic deposit funding).==== These two sources of funding (which finance 54% of total assets on average) correlate negatively with each other (by a factor of −0.37) – i.e., banks in part finance themselves either with foreign or local liquidity – however these two sources of liquidity for banks do not offset each other perfectly. Hence, by exploiting variation across banks (within a firm in a specific time-period), we effectively identify two distinct channels.====We run loan-level regressions saturated with firm*year:quarter fixed effects, absorbing all idiosyncratic, observed and unobserved, time-varying firm-level shocks, including firm-level credit demand (see Khwaja and Mian, 2008). Moreover, to understand the interaction of CC and RR with the monetary policy rates, we further interact banks' exposures with the local policy rate (see Kashyap and Stein, 2000; Jiménez et al., 2012, Jiménez et al., 2014), and crucially for understanding the mechanism, with the spread between the local and the US monetary rates. We also analyze the impact of both macroprudential policies on risk-taking in credit supply (see Jiménez et al., 2017).====Our analysis yields the following robust results. First, under capital account openness – i.e. before CC - banks use cheaper FX-funding from abroad to arbitrage higher local monetary (interest rate) policy rates. An increase in the local monetary policy rate raises the interest rate differential with respect to the United States, thereby inducing more FX-funded banks to expand credit supply to a given firm in a specific time-period (as compared to less FX-funded banks). In addition, our estimates suggest that carry trade lending promotes bank risk-taking, as during the boom we find a disproportionate increase of the supply of credit towards risky and opaque companies, which are likely to suffer more during a subsequent bust. Capital controls, by taxing FX-debt, break the carry trade, enhancing the bank-lending channel of local monetary policy rates as well as reducing the associated bank risk-taking.====The effects are economically meaningful. In response to a 1 percentage point (p.p.) jump in the policy rate spread between Colombia and the U.S., before CC, banks with a 1 standard deviation (s.d.) higher share of FX funds expand credit supply – to a given firm and in a specific time period – in relative terms by 3.8 p.p.. After CC, however, the same combination of spread-increase and larger FX funding is associated with a relative reduction in credit supply by 7.3 p.p. (as compared to the ex-ante effect of interacted FX funds and policy rate spread). Results suggest that the introduction of CC sharply reduces carry trade incentives and therefore enhances local monetary policy transmission to lending by highly FX indebted banks.====Second, the increase in reserve requirements on domestic deposits has a strong ==== effect on credit supply. Our estimates imply that, during the period of enforcement of the RR, a 1 s.d increase in reliance on local deposits funding across banks reduce credit to the same firm by 5.4 p.p. (as compared to before the policy adoption). Moreover, the credit supply cut disproportionally affects risky and opaque firms, so that domestic macroprudential measures also mitigate bank risk-taking during the credit boom. Interestingly, however, the increase in reserve requirements on domestic deposits does not enhance the effects of monetary rates on credit supply. That is, banks with different ex-ante domestic deposits funding do not differentially expand credit to a same firm in a given time period when the policy rate spread (or the policy rate) changes.====All results are robust to a wide variety of robustness checks. We run a large battery of models, and modify the main specifications by altering: the set of included fixed effects and/or observable controls; the strategies for the estimation of standard errors; and the sample period as well (i.e. we document that the effects take place around the introduction of the policies). Crucially, while our baseline findings on the interaction between CC and monetary policy rates exploit the policy rate spread (to highlight carry-trade motives), we show their robustness to employing alternative proxies of local monetary policy rates, including an index of local monetary policy surprises as well as the component of the policy rate spread predicted by such surprises. Those findings are especially important in that they: i) show that an unexpected component of monetary policy rates drives our results; ii) reassure about CC strengthening the pass-through of ==== monetary policy rate changes on credit supply, rather than just isolating it from the influence of US (external) monetary policy shocks. Moreover, results (using either the spread or the index of local monetary policy surprises) hold in a dynamic model, in which – instead of looking only at the response of current credit to lagged changes in the policy rates – we characterize through local projections (Jordà, 2005) the impulse-response function over different periods after the policy rate change.====We investigate the carry-trade mechanism even further. Banks refrain from accumulating FX-risk, because under the Basel rules (already in place during our sample) this implies costly additional capital charges. Consistently, we show that carry-trade lending is especially reactive to variations in the policy rate spread that trigger deviations from the Covered Interest Parity (CIP), granting positive carry returns under fully hedged FX-risk. Furthermore, results on carry-trade lending are entirely due to variations in peso-denominated loans, as opposed to FX-denominated loans, which is important as CC would tax banks' FX-funding only aimed at financing investments in peso, including peso loans to local firms. Moreover, we find that CC reduce bank risk-taking not only in bank assets (credit supply to riskier firms) but also in bank liabilities, as banks finance this (asset-side) risk-taking with fragile FX funding, thereby highlighting a novel important prudential mechanism of CC, which is especially beneficial given the poor performance of carries during major financial downturns (see Koijen et al., 2018).====Finally, as already mentioned, banks' reliance on domestic deposits and FX-financing are negatively correlated (by −0.37, highlighted in Fig. 5), suggesting that those banks which restrict credit supply more due to capital controls are less influenced by the domestic reserve requirements, and vice versa.==== It follows that the two policies are complementary in reducing credit supply and risk-taking, or, put differently, that both contribute to slowing down the credit boom and bank risk-taking. This result has broader policy implications. As credit booms stem from ==== foreign ==== local liquidity, our findings suggest that a Tinbergen rule with two (macroprudential) instruments is necessary to tackle the two (intermediate) objectives (sources of liquidity).====We organize the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section 3 describes the policy changes and the datasets.

I show that if the central bank is more patient than the government and as patient as households are, in equilibrium, the government issues more debt than what is socially optimal, and the central bank accumulates reserves to undo government over-borrowing. A key insight is that the government can issue more debt for any level of reserves but chooses not to because doing so would increase spreads, making it more costly to borrow. Quantitatively, I find that the lack of perfect coordination between the central bank and the government can rationalize levels of reserves and debt close to the observed levels in emerging economies.","The accumulation of international reserves and public debt in emerging economies is puzzling because economies facing default risk pay high interest rates on their liabilities and receive low interest rates on their reserves.==== Why, then, do economies paying significant sovereign spreads prefer to accumulate international reserves instead of paying back public debt? Moreover, what is the social welfare effect of reserve accumulation? Even though a large and growing literature addresses these questions, all previous studies have ignored the interaction between the central bank and the government by assuming a consolidated entity that simultaneously chooses reserves and debt.==== In practice, the central bank often manages international reserves, the government issues public debt, and policymakers may have different incentives driving their choices. This is particularly possible if the central bank is independent from the government. Furthermore, Fig. 1 illustrates a positive association between the accumulation of reserves and the widespread adoption of central bank independence (CBI) legislation in Latin America. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to explore the role of CBI in the accumulation of international reserves.====I use a sovereign default model – Eaton and Gersovitz (1981); Aguiar and Gopinath (2006); Arellano (2008) – enhanced to incorporate an independent central bank that can save in a risk-free foreign asset (i.e. international reserves). As is common in sovereign default models, the government can issue defaultable one-period debt with foreign lenders. I also follow the literature by modelling political pressures as giving the government a low discount factor relative to the foreign lenders.==== In contrast, I assume that the central bank is more patient than the government is and as patient as households are (i.e. benevolent central bank) to capture the idea that independent central banks operate within institutional frameworks that isolate them from political pressures and that align the central bank's incentives with those of the households.==== This assumption, which is the main departure from the literature, leads to a disagreement among policymakers about households’ intertemporal consumption. I show that, in equilibrium, the lack of perfect coordination between the central bank and government rationalizes simultaneously positive levels of reserves and debt.====On one hand, an impatient government would like to increase its current spending and therefore will issue more debt than what is socially optimal. On the other hand, a benevolent central bank would like to undo government borrowing by accumulating reserves.==== Because the government could also undo the effects of reserve accumulation by issuing more debt for any level of reserves, why, then, would the central bank choose to accumulate reserves? Consider a portfolio in which the economy is holding zero reserves. For any reserve asset bought by the central bank, the government could issue one bond to undo the effect of the central bank's purchases on the net debt position. However, the government's cost of undoing purchases is increasing in the level of reserves because portfolios having higher levels of reserves and debt implies higher sovereign spreads. Therefore, the government understands that it could undo the effect of reserve accumulation on the net debt position but chooses not to because having higher spreads reduces the amount of consumption that can be front-loaded. Thus, by accumulating international reserves, the central bank has the ability to shift resources toward the future in a way that an impatient government cannot undo.====It is essential for the mechanism of the model to assume that when a government defaults, international lenders cannot seize the international reserves held by the central bank. Otherwise, the relevant statistic would be the foreign net position, as in Arellano (2008). To illustrate this point, suppose that after a default, a central bank cannot maintain control of its reserves. Therefore, accumulating reserves would increase the repayment value but not the default value. Thus, buying one reserve asset would decrease the probability of default to the same magnitude as increasing debt by one bond, but in the opposite direction. Subsection 2.3 describes the case of Argentina in 2015, which is consistent with this assumption and guarantees that vulture funds will not be allowed to seize the reserves held by an independent central bank.====The model is solved numerically to evaluate its quantitative predictions regarding the levels of international reserves, public debt, and sovereign spreads. I calibrate the model using data for Mexico, a typical emerging economy with an independent central bank, which is a common reference for studies on reserve accumulation. The central bank's discount factor is disciplined by matching the money market interest rate, and the government's discount factor is calibrated internally by targeting public debt.==== I find that, under the benchmark calibration, model simulations account for 75% of the average level of reserves observed in Mexico from 1994 to 2017. Moreover, I also find that in periods of high income and low spreads, the government increases borrowing and the central bank accumulates more reserves, which accounts for a high and positive correlation between reserves and debt that is consistent with the pattern observed in the data.====Finally, I contrast the baseline model with an economy in which the central bank is as impatient as the government is (i.e. consolidated government). I show that, in accordance with Alfaro and Kanczuk (2009), a sovereign default model with a consolidated government cannot rationalize simultaneously positive levels of debt and reserves. By comparing these two economies, I quantify the welfare gains of having an independent central bank that can accumulate reserves. I find that accumulating reserves by 6.5% of GDP reduces the net debt position by 3.0% of GDP and increases social welfare by 0.1%. Welfare gains come from reducing the costs of front-loading public spending and mitigating the distortion in households’ intertemporal consumption.",International reserves and central bank independence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001064,10 August 2022,2022,Research Article,62.0

I extend a standard sovereign default model to include disaster risk and calibrate it to a sample of seven Caribbean countries that are frequently hit by hurricanes. I find that hurricane risk reduces governments’ ability to issue debt and depresses welfare. Climate change will further restrict governments’ access to financial markets and weigh on welfare. “Disaster clauses”, especially those allowing governments to write off debt, improve governments’ borrowing terms and mitigate the impact of climate change on governments’ access to financial markets and households’ welfare.","Unexpected shocks may tip vulnerable countries into a default. The literature has emphasized the role of domestic and external shocks, such as fluctuations of the business cycle (Arellano, 2008) or commodity prices (Reinhart et al., 2016), in shaping sovereign risk. However-, disasters, such as wars, pandemics, and extreme weather events, are equally important.==== Natural disasters appear especially salient in light of the key role they played in recent default episodes (e.g. Grenada in 2004, and Antigua y Barbuda in 2004 and 2009), the climate crisis, and the ongoing debate around climate-change adaption strategies. In particular, the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters has led economists and policy makers to advocate in favor of “disaster clauses”, that provide debt relief when countries are hit by disasters. Using a quantitative model of sovereign default, I study the impact of extreme weather and climate change on governments’ access to financial markets. I show that natural disasters reduce governments’ ability to borrow from abroad, and depress welfare. I also show that climate change will further restrict governments’ access to financial markets. Additionally, I quantify the impact of disaster clauses on governments’ borrowing terms and households’ welfare. I find that disaster clauses featuring reductions of the nominal value of debt expand governments’ ability to issue debt, improve welfare, and mitigate the impact of climate change. Disaster clauses featuring suspensions of coupon payments have, instead, a modest impact on debt quantities and may reduce welfare.====Methodologically, I study the relation between climate risk and sovereign defaults through the lens of a quantitative sovereign default model. In detail, I extend a standard sovereign default model with long-term bonds as in Hatchondo and Martinez (2009) and Chatterjee et al. (2020) to include disaster risk. Disasters are modeled as exogenous shocks to income and are calibrated to reproduce the frequency and intensity of major hurricanes in a sample of seven Caribbean economies that are the focus of this study. Comparing model predictions from the baseline model to those from an alternative version of the model that eliminates disaster risk, I find that hurricanes restrict governments’ access to financial markets. Absent disaster risk, debt-to-GDP ratios are higher, spreads are lower, and welfare increases.====Next, I evaluate the impact of climate change on public finances, investigating how government policies respond to an increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes. I find that borrowings rates increase, while debt-to-GDP ratios and welfare decline.====Finally, I analyze the impact of disaster clauses on governments’ access to financial markets and welfare. I study two alternative designs. In the first design, I consider a clause that allows governments to suspend coupon payments when natural disasters hit. In the second design, I consider a clause that allows governments to reduce the face value of debt when natural disasters hit. I find that coupon suspension clauses have a modest impact on governments’ borrowing conditions. They are associated with higher debt-to-GDP ratios, a slight improvement of borrowing terms, and a modest decline of welfare. Debt reduction clauses have, instead, a major impact on governments’ borrowing conditions. Following their introduction, debt levels, spreads, and welfare soar. Hurricane clauses also mitigate the impact of climate change. With coupon suspension clauses welfare losses associated with climate change are 15% smaller than in the baseline. With debt reduction clauses welfare losses are 50% smaller. All told, the analysis suggests that debt reduction clauses are more effective than coupon suspension clauses, as they allow governments to start fresh when natural disasters hit.====My paper contributes to two main strands of the literature. First, I contribute to the quantitative literature on sovereign risk in the tradition of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) and Arellano (2008). In particular, this paper highlights and quantifies the impact of natural disasters and climate change on sovereign risk. In doing so, this paper also stresses the importance of disaster events in explaining default risk. Closely related, Rebelo et al. (2018) examine the relation between rare financial disasters, financial development, and sovereign risk and find that rare financial disasters restrict governments’ ability to issue debt in countries with low financial development. In an independent working paper with an analytical focus, Phan and Felipe (2020) also examine the effects of natural disasters on sovereign debt models. While the two papers share the same interest for the interaction between natural disasters and sovereign risk, they differ in that this paper has a quantitative focus. Specifically, I quantify the impact of hurricanes and climate change on key economic variables, such as sovereign spreads, debt-to-GDP levels, and welfare, in a sample of seven Caribbean economies. Within the quantitative sovereign default literature, this paper is also related to the work of Hatchondo and Martinez (2012) and Hatchondo et al. (2017), who study the implications of contingency clauses on the price of government debt and on governments’ default and borrowing policies. However, while Hatchondo and Martinez (2012) and Hatchondo et al. (2017) focus on GDP-linked bonds and CoCos, my paper is, to the best of my knowledge, the first one to focus on disaster clauses.====Second, I contribute to the literature that quantifies the impact of disaster risk on asset prices (Barro, 2009) and the macroeconomy (Gourio, 2012). In particular, this paper is related to the work of Mejia (2016) and Nordhaus (2010), who estimate the economic cost of hurricanes in the Caribbean and in the United States and their projected evolution with climate change.==== This paper pushes this line of research further, as it evaluates the implications of such costs for public finances, the price of government debt, and sovereign risk.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents background information on the interaction between sovereign risk and extreme weather with a special emphasis on Grenada. Section 3 introduces the theoretical model. Section 4 presents the calibration strategy for the quantitative analysis. Section 5 reports quantitative results. Section 6 examines the case for disaster clauses. Section 7 concludes.","Natural disasters, climate change, and sovereign risk",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622001040,5 August 2022,2022,Research Article,63.0

Their impact was only significant when they were implemented for the first time and targeted more than one country. For the volatility spillover channels, we generally find balanced networks with no fragmentation over time.","There is large empirical evidence that markets have calmed down after the recent EU sovereign crisis. However, it remains still unclear if and to what extent it is policy interventions or rather regulatory changes which have impacted and mitigated contagion and associated systemic risk most significantly. A thorough understanding is crucial for judging the current and long run implications for the resilience of the system.====In this paper, we analyze the real-time dynamic effects of policy and regulatory interventions on contagion measured as substantial increases in sovereign interdependencies from idiosyncratic shocks (Dornbusch et al., 2000, Forbes and Rigobon, 2002) where specific events have large scale effects on financial stability (Constâncio, 2012). In particular, we use high-frequency sovereign credit default swap (CDS) data to quantify levels and uncertainty of spillover effects as main drivers of contagion (see Allen and Gale, 2000). Generally, large levels and changes in spillovers mark contagion and instability in the system indicating systemic risk. We provide formal tools in assessing the degree of contagion within a system. Moreover, we can test if changes in size and form of these spillovers over time are significant such that they might cause stabilizing effects of an intervention which we then label as successful in reducing systemic risk. In particular, we introduce an intervention impact measure Δ on the overall system and also more granular on the country level allowing to easily compare different types of actions over time.====We use novel intraday sovereign CDS data for the years 2009–2014. This time span comprises both, policy interventions and regulatory actions, such as the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) of the ECB, the ban of trading naked sovereign CDS or the new ISDA rules. We show that with higher than daily observation frequency it is possible to empirically disentangle, record the impact and judge the significance of the different types of events. This complements the many studies on the evolution of systemic risk in the EU sovereign context in the course of policy interventions, which rely only on shorter span daily data before and just shortly after the most important regulatory measures.==== This limitation of the data prevented investigations on the impact of regulatory changes, and derived point estimates for policy interventions were of unknown precision. In contrast, we provide finite sample adequate bootstrap tools to assess if changes in systemic risk are significant. In order to obtain tight confidence intervals for the impact of closely succeeding events, high-frequency observations are key. In this sense, we contribute to the vast literature on providing point estimates and confidence sets of systemic risk measured as spillover effects in a network set-up (see e.g. Betz et al., 2016, Bostanci and Yilmaz, 2020, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014, Engle et al., 2015, Hautsch et al., 2015).====For assessing contagion and thus systemic risk we focus on credit risk spillovers on a high-frequency level. Generally, the joint monetary policy in the Euro area links sovereign credit quality via shared default risk by the temporary European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) until 2012 and afterwards by the permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Spillovers among sovereign bonds occur due to a joint monetary policy transmission mechanism and the collateral framework of the Eurosystem implying cross-effects in CDS. We investigate the short-term aim of policy interventions and regulatory changes to calm financial markets. The short-term effects also influence a sustainable rebalancing of the economy in the long run. For stabilization of a country's financial sector, the decrease of volatility in respective yields and spreads is a main concern and therefore an important indicator (see e.g. Gros et al., 2014, Vergote et al., 2017). With our data, we can thoroughly assess this short-term effect, which in the longer run should then also impact a country's or region's economic outlook and be measurable in key economic indicators such as economic growth, employment rates, fiscal sustainability and financial stability (see e.g. IMF, 2010). Moreover, we can determine if the interventions have reduced the transmission of shocks amongst countries and have therefore also decreased the vulnerability of the financial system as a whole. This clearly is the goal of any macro-prudential policy and requires a network approach.====Technically, we determine interconnections via the order invariant generalized forecast error variance decomposition (see Pesaran and Shin, 1998) as proposed in Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014. We go beyond the status quo of only computing point estimates of unknown precision for this measure. Thus, by constructing bootstrap confidence intervals and significance tests for connectedness on all aggregation levels of the detected spillover network, we can distinguish significant volatility cross-effects from others. As a consequence, we cannot only assess the size but also the statistical significance of interventions. Hence we can also infer which changes in the measures allow for a meaningful interpretation.====Due to the short high-frequency pre- and post-intervention windows, we argue that the measured intervention impacts have a causal flavor as coincidences of external events are rare or can be shown to have no direct influence. In the specific case of regulatory interventions, we confirm the causality of the effect with an identification strategy using non-affected bonds. Therefore, the detection of significant aggregated spillover changes and significant spillover channels on the network level around interventions enables us to comprehensively evaluate and categorize the effectiveness of crisis-related policy measures and regulation in the CDS market. We explicitly show that our empirical results do not depend on a specific choice of the underlying dynamics and are robust with respect to tuning parameter choices such as rolling window length, forecast horizon and lag length. Also, neither the fact that we use variance decomposition for measuring spillovers nor a specific type of decomposition appears to substantially affect our main findings (see Chan-Lau, 2017).====Our novel intraday CDS dataset allows for a better accuracy in estimating spillovers and judging the impact of policy and regulation measures on the dynamics of the European sovereign CDS market. Up to our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the significance of connectedness using intraday CDS data. In particular, due to this intraday data set, it is possible to evaluate the connectedness on a high precision level. This is especially important when studying the impact of specific events on reducing systemic risk where spillovers in respective pre- and post-event windows are compared in order to judge the effectiveness of this policy or regulatory event (see also Vergote et al., 2017). For our intraday data, there are sufficiently many observations within estimation windows of only a few trading days in order to obtain meaningfully precise estimates. Larger windows covering more trading days would inevitably contain effects of other closely succeeding events and dilute the picture.====We investigate the two most important regulatory changes in the EU sovereign CDS market: the ban on trading naked sovereign CDS in 2012 and the new ISDA rules in 2014. Our analysis provides evidence for their success in terms of reducing connectedness and speculation in affected countries. By quantifying volatility spillovers on all network aggregation levels and taking liquidity effects into account, we uncover the size and the channels of the impact of the ban and the new ISDA rules. In particular, we show that there is more than a simple liquidity story behind the success of the ban and the new ISDA regulation and we explicitly exclude other drivers such as general macroeconomic effects and events as well as market volatility.====Moreover, throughout the crisis, we cannot determine any fragmentation within our CDS sovereign spillover networks and thus conclude that there must be multiple sources of contagion. This insight goes beyond previous studies with bond yields (see e.g. Ehrmann and Fratzscher, 2017) which in contrast to CDS have been shown to suffer from many problems in representing credit risk (see Pan and Singleton, 2008, Ang and Longstaff, 2011).====Furthermore, European-wide measures prove to impact connectedness in a more sustainable manner than measures aimed at one particular country. Unconventional policy interventions which aimed at mitigating systemic risk include economic adjustment programs (EAP) (two for Greece, one for Ireland, Portugal and Spain) and the bond purchases as part of the SMP, which was succeeded by the outright monetary transactions (OMT) program. The OMT was introduced after Draghi's speech stating the ECB would do ‘whatever it takes’ to sustain the Euro. Both the SMP and Draghi's speech are examples of events that targeted the entire Euro area. In addition, we provide evidence for diminishing effects in unconventional policy measures leading to a decrease of their effectiveness. An overview and the timeline of the considered unconventional policy actions is contained in Table 7 in the Online Appendix.====Our paper contributes to the recent literature on network spillover measures (e.g. Diebold and Yilmaz, 2009, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012, Engle et al., 2015) pointing out the importance of checking cross-effects for significance. In particular, for the connectedness literature (see e.g. Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014, Alter and Beyer, 2014) we provide a finite sample accurate bootstrap procedure in order to determine the significance of spillover effects and changes in spillovers. This complements Bostanci and Yilmaz (2020), who propose a different bootstrap procedure as a cluster classification device. Our empirical results confirm that many changes in spillovers were indeed not significant and should therefore be interpreted with care, especially on the granular network level but also when evaluating aggregate network characteristics. We obtain these results despite the use of high-frequency data, which generally allow for a much better estimation precision than studies with only daily observations. The use of daily data is the standard case in the literature (see also e.g. Claeys and Vašíček, 2012, Claeys and Vašíček, 2014). Moreover, in contrast to Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2017), De Santis and Zimic (2018) and others, we focus on credit default swaps which pick up credit information more accurately and quicker than bonds (see Buse and Schienle, 2019) being less affected by funding liquidity and flight-to-safety issues (see Pan and Singleton, 2008, Ang and Longstaff, 2011). These points are key in particular when evaluating the impact of policy or regulatory actions. Although we are the first to use intraday CDS data to study network spillover effects, the advantages of intraday data in general have been pointed out by several papers. Neil and Fillion (1999) have already stressed that high frequency data should be used to assess the impact of interventions. Similarly, Vergote et al. (2017) argue that daily data is not sufficient to study the effectiveness of the SMP. For further discussions see also Gyntelberg et al. (2018).====Moreover, according to our knowledge, this paper is the first to consistently analyze ECB programs, economic adjustment programs, the ban of naked sovereign CDS as well as the ISDA regulations from 2014. In particular, the impact of the ISDA regulation in 2014 is a key point which has not been studied in the literature so far. It turns out to be more important than the previous measures. Compared to the ISDA regulation, the academic discourse on the ban on short-selling of naked sovereign CDS is long and heated with controversial views. In line with Portes (2010) and Kiesel et al. (2015), we find empirical evidence that banning naked sovereign CDS has stabilized markets and reduced speculation. This is in contrast to models by e.g. Oehmke and Zawadowski (2015) that claim a ban on naked CDS can raise borrowing costs and hence potentially reduces liquidity making the ban overall counter-productive. While their model predicts a negative CDS-bond basis, we empirically find this basis to be almost consistently positive. Short-selling bans have also been analyzed for other markets, e.g. Beber and Pagano (2013a) examined stock markets and found reduced liquidity and a slow-down of the price discovery process. However, a direct comparison with our findings is difficult, because bans on stocks were only temporary and limited to certain stocks.====Research on the effectiveness of the ECB's unconventional policy measures mainly focused on the ECB's asset purchasing programs and analyzed bond yield data, see for example Eser and Schwaab (2016), Falagiarda and Reitz (2015) or Gibson et al. (2016). Also Arghyrou and Kontonikas (2012) analyse the Euro area debt crisis using daily bond data focusing on contagion amongst sovereign entities. By analyzing the effects of policies on CDS markets of both asset purchasing programs as well as EAPs, our paper puts effects of these measures in relative context opening up a much broader perspective on each single action.====The paper is organized as follows: Section2 carefully describes the intraday data.

The model is consistent with data on firm demand for foreign labor and firm size in the United States. Monopolistically competitive firms in the skill-intensive sector differ in productivity and a subset of relatively larger firms hire foreign workers subject to skilled immigration policies that are similar to the United States: Firms face hiring costs and there is an immigration cap that binds if the aggregate demand for foreign workers exceeds a quota. A binding immigration cap reduces firms’ demand for foreign skilled workers and, quantitatively, accounts for 16.82% of the hiring distortion in the decentralized equilibrium when compared to the first-best allocation. We evaluate the effects of different immigration cap changes and quantify the welfare implications for domestic households.","There has been a rapid increase in the number of foreign skilled workers in the U.S. labor force. Among all foreign-born individuals, those employed with at least a bachelor's degree witnessed the sharpest increase (58 percent) during the 2004–2017 period. The corresponding increase for the native born in the same skill group was 34 percent. This led to an increase in the proportion of college-educated foreign born employed in the U.S. labor force from 18 percent to 21 percent.====Given this increase in the stock of foreign-born skilled labor, there have been growing debates regarding U.S. skilled immigration policy and its impact on native workers. However, relatively few studies focus on the role of firms and firm demand for foreign workers, even though the current skilled immigration policy fully centers around firms. Since its inception in 1990, the H-1B visa program remains the dominant entry route of foreign skilled workers into the U.S. labor force. Firms play a crucial role in hiring, sponsoring, and incurring costs at each stage of the H-1B application process for a foreign worker. The first step requires a firm that wants to hire a foreign worker to file a Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the Department of Labor in which one of the items that they need to specify is the number of foreign workers they would like to hire for a particular occupation. These LCAs signal vacancies or firm demand for foreign skilled labor. However, the actual number of visas issued to foreign workers is determined by a policy-imposed cap.====The gap between firm demand, measured by the number of workers requested in the LCAs filed, and visas issued tends to grow during expansionary periods (Fig. 1).==== Moreover, the visa cap was met in each year since 2004, in less than a week in seven of those years (Fig. 2), and visas for foreign skilled workers were allocated according to a lottery process. These facts indicate that there is a strong demand for foreign skilled workers that is not accommodated by the current immigration policy.====The role of firm demand for foreign skilled workers and the current allocation mechanism of foreign workers across them have implications for how an increase in skilled immigration and changes in immigration policies impact the aggregate economy. A better understanding of these implications requires a framework that focuses on key features of immigration policy in the U.S.====Motivated by this, our paper introduces a dynamic macroeconomic general equilibrium framework that mimics skilled immigration policy in the U.S. — firms incur costs and submit applications for workers and there is an immigration cap that binds if the aggregate demand for foreign skilled workers exceeds the exogenous quota. Our model is consistent with trends in the data and matches the distribution of foreign worker demand across U.S. firms. We use this framework to study distortions due to the current immigration policy and the impacts of easing immigration policy entry restrictions.====We first present key data trends related to firm demand for foreign skilled workers and its relationship with firm size using the LCA and Compustat database between 2012 and 2018. First, around 53.6% of firms in our sample submit a positive number of applications for hiring foreign skilled workers. Second, firms that frequently submit LCA applications every year account for more than 98% of the total applications submitted during our reference period. Third, firms that submit a positive number of applications for foreign workers are, on average, approximately 6.75 times larger than firms that do not submit any applications. Fourth, among firms that submit applications, there is a positive relationship between the number of applications submitted and firm size (using firm sales as a proxy).==== However, the applications-to-sales ratio is relatively constant among firms which indicates that the number of applications submitted is not an increasing function of firm size.====Next, we introduce a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model that is consistent with these data trends. The skill-intensive sector (sector 1) includes firms with heterogeneous relative productivity drawn from a Pareto distribution. Only a fraction of these firms (type-==== firms) that are above a fixed productivity cutoff hire both domestic and foreign skilled workers that are imperfect substitutes in production. The firms below this cutoff produce output using only domestic skilled workers (type-==== firms).==== Domestic skilled workers are perfectly mobile across sector-1 firms and therefore earn the same skilled domestic wage. Domestic and foreign-born skilled workers also earn the same skilled wage, consistent with immigration policy regulations. Taking skilled wages and policy as given, type-==== firms optimally choose to hire foreign workers till the expected discounted benefit of hiring a foreign worker is equal to the hiring cost. The main incentive for hiring foreign workers arises due to a wedge between the marginal revenue product of a foreign skilled worker relative to the wage paid to them. The immigration cap binds when the aggregate demand for foreign labor exceeds the policy-imposed quota. When this happens, firms are allocated only an endogenous fraction of their initial applications. There is also an exogenous return probability of foreign workers to their country of origin. Perfectly competitive firms in the second sector employ unskilled labor to produce a homogeneous product.====We calibrate the main parameters of the baseline model that pertain to immigration to match the U.S. economy during the 2004–2018 period and solve the model using global non-linear methods. Our decentralized economy is consistent with the data in several ways. First, type-==== firms are more productive on average than type-==== firms. Second, within type-==== firms, larger firms employ more foreign skilled labor. However, in both the model and data, larger firms do not hire more workers relative to their firm size. Most importantly, the distribution of foreign worker demand across type-==== firms matches the data — both our model and data show that 20% of the firms hire approximately 80% of the foreign workers in the economy, while the other 80% of the firms hire the remaining 20% of the foreign workers. Our model can also qualitatively generate firm responses that are consistent with Figs. 1 and 2 — for instance, during recessionary periods, firm hiring responds less than an immigration cap increase.====We then consider the normative implications of skilled immigration policy by solving for the first-best optimal allocations that an unconstrained social planner would choose. We show that in the planned economy, welfare is maximized when all sector-1 firms hire foreign workers. Moreover, the immigration cap, regulatory costs, and market structure features that are important in this framework, lead to distortions and inefficiently low hiring of foreign workers in the decentralized economy. The gap relative to the planned economy increases in response to aggregate productivity shocks.====Finally, we present the transitional dynamics and welfare results following counterfactual immigration cap changes. First, we consider the impact of permanently raising the cap to the first-best level, which makes the cap immediately nonbinding. This removes the distortion due to the cap, which accounts for around 16.82 percent of the hiring inefficiency relative to the planner's economy. The absence of the cap effectively lowers the cost of hiring foreign workers and therefore increases firm demand for them. Since firms are no longer constrained by a binding cap, the foreign skilled workers employed in type-==== firms increase. This leads to a reallocation of domestic skilled workers from type-==== to type-==== firms. Firm profits fall initially as additional resources are incurred in hiring workers in type-==== firms. As the stock of skilled workers builds up during the transition, skill-intensive output and profits increase in both type-==== and type-==== firms.====Easing immigration policy restrictions has heterogeneous impacts on domestic workers. Unskilled workers gain due to a wage increase since more skilled labor employed in the economy increases demand for unskilled output and therefore, unskilled labor. The welfare gain for unskilled workers amounts to approximately 6% of initial steady state consumption. However, skilled workers incur net losses due to the influx of skilled labor and the associated decrease in skilled wages — the welfare loss to the domestic skilled household amounts to 1.35% the initial steady state consumption. We also consider the impact of smaller cap changes such that the cap remains binding, the role of profit distribution across households, and the role of elastic labor supply.","Skilled immigration, firms, and policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000940,2 August 2022,2022,Research Article,65.0

We study a two-sector, tradable and non-tradable, ","One of the most spectacular recent trends in the international monetary system is the considerable built up of foreign exchange reserves by emerging countries, in particular East Asian economies and China. As shown by Fig. 1a, the average reserves-to-GDP ratio in developing countries more than doubled between 1980 and 2020, increasing from 8 to 21 percent.==== The increase has been particularly marked in East Asia, where the average reserves-to-GDP ratio passed from 14 percent in 1980 to 52 percent in 2020.====The large accumulation of foreign reserves is not just interesting in itself, but it also represents a key element for understanding the direction and allocation of international capital flows among developing economies. As noticed by Gourinchas and Jeanne (2013), while the neoclassical growth model would suggest that capital should be directed towards those economies that experience faster productivity growth, in the data we observe that faster growing economies are associated with lower net capital inflows (Fig. 1b). Moreover, Alfaro et al. (2014) show that the positive correlation between current account surpluses and growth is purely driven by public flows, while private flows conform with the predictions of the neoclassical growth model. In fact, they find that the current account surpluses of fast growing economies are due to their policy of fast accumulation of international reserves (Fig. 1c), while current account deficits in countries that experienced dismal growth performances are driven by inflows of foreign aid.====Our main objective in this paper is to provide a framework that explains the joint behavior of private and public capital flows in fast growing emerging economies. We study a two-sector, tradable and non-tradable, small open economy. There are two key elements. First, firms in the tradable sector absorb foreign knowledge by importing intermediate inputs. This mechanism provides the source of growth in our economy, but its benefits are not internalized by individual firms since knowledge can be used freely by all the firms in the economy. Second, private agents have limited access to international financial markets and the economy is exposed to the risk of sudden stops in capital inflows.====The combination of growth externalities and financial frictions provides a powerful incentive for the government to accumulate reserves. First, we show that during tranquil times the government can use reserve accumulation to exploit the knowledge spillovers in the tradable sector. In fact, an increase in foreign exchange reserves leads to a real currency depreciation and to a reallocation of production toward the tradable sector. This stimulates the use of imported inputs, the absorption of foreign knowledge and productivity growth.====This mechanism is effective as long as there is imperfect substitutability between private and public flows. Indeed, in the neoclassical growth model the accumulation of international reserves would be offset by private capital inflows. Instead, in our framework the presence of financial frictions limits the ability of private agents to accumulate debt in response to an increase in the stock of reserves by the government. Hence, while the economy as a whole runs a current account surplus and gathers foreign reserves, the private sector accumulates foreign liabilities, consistent with the empirical findings of Alfaro et al. (2014).====Second, we show that the presence of knowledge externalities provides an incentive for the government to use reserves during financial crises, in order to counteract the loss of access to private credit by firms in the tradable sector. Indeed, our framework reproduces the pattern of gross capital flows observed by Broner et al. (2013) in emerging markets. During financial crises both gross inflows, in the form of private credit, and gross outflows, in the form of reserve accumulation, decrease, since the government uses its stock of reserves to provide loans to firms that have lost access to foreign financing. Through this channel, reserve management positively affects growth by cushioning the impact of financial crises on output and productivity growth.====We then examine the normative implications of reserve accumulation. We first show that a social planner that is unconstrained in terms of policy tools would choose not to accumulate reserves but to rely on sectoral subsidies. We argue, similarly to what Korinek and Serven (2016) suggest, that in practice sectoral subsidies may conflict with WTO rules or other trade agreements. In this case, a policy of reserve accumulation can be used to circumvent these restrictions. We compute within a class of simple rules the optimal reserve policy and we find that, despite being a second-best policy tool, the welfare gains from optimal reserve management may be potentially significant. As an example, in an illustrative numerical exercise, we find that the gains from public intervention in capital flows for a country that is opening itself to international capital markets are in the order of a 1 percent permanent increase in consumption. Moreover, we find that the bulk of these welfare gains comes from the use of reserves during financial crises.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We start by discussing our key assumptions and the related literature. Then, in Section 2 we introduce the framework. Section 3 presents the social planning allocation and discusses the political barriers that may prevent a government from implementing the first best through sectoral subsidies. Section 4 provides intuition about the effect of reserve management. Section 5 presents the results of our policy experiment on financial liberalization and discusses the welfare gains from implementing the optimal reserve policy. Section 6 concludes.","Reserve accumulation, growth and financial crises",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000927,2 August 2022,2022,Research Article,66.0

Although these austerity packages were supported by international organizations and policy makers, there were many actors opposing to this type of policies. The typical argument against fiscal consolidation was that sharp reductions in public spending or increases in taxes could worsen the recession, erode the tax base, and even become self-defeating or ineffective in reducing debt to GDP ratios and default risk.==== Furthermore, the risk of facing a self-defeating austerity effort was not only highlighted by many economists, but also by rating agencies such as Standard & Poors====:====This paper aims to assess whether these concerns were adequate or were overemphasized by those against fiscal consolidation. In other words, it aims to determine when self-defeating austerities are more likely to happen, and quantify the overall probability of these types of events. To do so, it proposes a small open economy general equilibrium model that incorporates the trade-off behind the debate. In this model, fiscal austerity can reduce debt and sovereign spreads, but it can also cause a deeper recession with higher unemployment that might in turn increase default risk and spreads. The model has three salient characteristics. First, in order to display a realistic fiscal policy it incorporates fiscal rules estimated using historical data. These rules enter the model in a similar way to how a Taylor rule is incorporated into a monetary DSGE model. These rules are a key element to identify discretionary changes in fiscal policy aiming to reduce government spending. In other words, I use these rules to define fiscal austerity.====Second, motivated by high unemployment rates in some European countries, the model features downward nominal wage rigidity as in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) and Na et al. (2018). This nominal rigidity, coupled with a fixed exchange rate, generates a real rigidity that can cause unemployment in equilibrium. Third, it assumes that the government can strategically default on its debt as in Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) and Arellano (2008). To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a model with these three characteristics jointly.====I analyze the theoretical implications of the model and derive conditions under which austerity is more likely to increase sovereign spreads instead of reducing them. I find that austerity can be self-defeating only when austerity packages are persistent and the economy is expected to be in a recession with high fiscal multipliers. The reason is that under those conditions a decrease in government spending can increase the likelihood of a deeper recession in the future, reduce the tax burden in a potential default scenario and, as a consequence, increase default risk and sovereign spreads even when there is a drop in the stock of external debt.====I also use the model to analyze the case of Spain during the last sovereign debt crisis. Spain was one of the countries that implemented important austerity packages from 2010. I assess the effects of an important decrease in government spending through a counterfactual exercise. I ask what would have happened to sovereign spreads, debt to GDP ratios and economic activity if, instead of implementing fiscal austerity after the second quarter of 2010, Spain had followed historical fiscal rules. I find that austerity was effective decreasing sovereign spreads and debt to GDP ratios even in a context of relatively high fiscal multipliers. Nevertheless, austerity had costs in terms of economic activity.====Overall, I find that self-defeating austerities are generally unlikely at least for economies that are similar to Spain. After simulating different calibrations of the model implying different fiscal multipliers I find that the likelihood of facing self-defeating episodes is less than 1.4% when fiscal multipliers are lower or equal to 2.5. Moreover, this probability can be further reduced if the government can commit to a non-persistent austerity, or to reduce the magnitude of future austerity during recessions.",Sovereign spreads and the effects of fiscal austerity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000903,25 July 2022,2022,Research Article,67.0

We study an open economy workhorse model of macroprudential regulation motivated by pecuniary externalities. Our analytical characterization shows that imperfect enforcement generates two opposing effects. While tighter regulation leads to higher borrowing by unregulated agents, a “leakage effect”, mitigating the increase in fragility calls for “squeezing” regulated agents further. Quantitative simulations show that, overall, a macroprudential policy that accounts for the leakages remains successful at mitigating the vulnerability to financial crises.","Macroprudential regulation has emerged as a central element of the post-financial crisis dominant policy paradigm, in which the management of credit cycles has been elevated to the rank of first-order policy concerns. Central to this view is the notion that curbing credit booms reduces financial sector vulnerabilities to future reversals in financial conditions. The effectiveness of macroprudential regulation, however, is not being taken for granted and has been the subject of a growing empirical literature (see, e.g., Cerutti et al., 2017). Indeed, a common policy concern is that such new regulation could be bypassed and have unintended consequences.====How is the optimal design of macroprudential regulation altered by the presence of leakages? Is the scope for macroprudential policy significantly altered by the possibility of leakages? Does macroprudential policy remain desirable in the presence of leakages? The theoretical literature on macroprudential policy has so far abstracted from the imperfect regulation enforcement, and thus a proper framework to address these questions is lacking. Our goal in this paper is to fill this gap by providing a theoretical model suited to tackle these issues.====In line with the emerging policy paradigm and the theoretical literature, we adopt a framework in which inefficient private borrowing decisions generate excessive financial fragility (e.g., Lorenzoni, 2008; Bianchi, 2011). In our theory, a pecuniary externality resulting from frictions in financial markets makes macroprudential policy desirable, yet the introduction of such policy endogenously leads to increased risk taking by a shadow sector endowed with the ability to bypass regulation. These unintended spillover effects in turn feed into the economy's exposure to financial crises, limiting the effectiveness of macroprudential policy and altering its optimal design.====We start our analysis with a tractable three-period model. In the model, agents initially make a borrowing decision and are then subject to income shocks in the intermediate period while facing a collateral constraint that limits their ability to smooth consumption. The presence of a market price in the collateral constraint implies that the higher the aggregate leverage chosen in the initial period, the larger the contraction in the borrowing capacity in the intermediate period for all households. This pecuniary externality and the associated financial amplification effects are not internalized by private households, providing a rationale for a macroprudential policy aimed at limiting private leverage.====Different from existing studies, macroprudential regulation is subject to imperfect enforcement. In particular, the macroprudential authority is able to curb risk taking within a narrow (regulated) sector, while internalizing the endogenous response of the shadow (unregulated) sector. A stricter macroprudential policy seeking to make regulated agents internalize the pecuniary externality creates a safer environment but has the unintended consequence of encouraging higher borrowing by unregulated agents. These spillovers undermine the effectiveness of macroprudential policy and increase the economy's exposure to financial crises.====We show that despite destabilizing spillover effects on the unregulated sphere, a small macroprudential tax on regulated agents is always strictly welfare improving for all agents. Going beyond a perturbation argument, we derive an explicit formula for the optimal macroprudential tax. Relative to the standard Pigouvian tax expression familiar from the literature, accounting for leakages yields two new elements. One reflects the weaker influence of the financial regulator onto the price of collateral due to the unregulated sector partially offsetting the regulated sector's response to the regulation. The second one reflects the regulator's higher valuation of relaxing future collateral constraints resulting from the unregulated sector's higher exposure to financial crises. Taken together, these two effects imply an ambiguous effect of leakages on the size of optimal macroprudential taxes. We then turn to an infinite horizon model to pursue a quantitative analysis. In the infinite horizon context, leakages further give rise to a time inconsistency problem. To see why, suppose agents expect loose regulation in the future. This expectation generates a perception of a riskier environment, which induces unregulated agents to take less risk today, narrowing the gap between the borrowing choices of regulated and unregulated agents. Interestingly, this channel works despite unregulated agents not being directly subject to regulation. Given our goal of evaluating the extent to which leakages undermine the effectiveness of regulation, we find it useful to focus on a discretionary regime in which a regulator has limited ability to exploit the disciplining effect just described. We thus consider a government that sets optimal regulation sequentially and without commitment, and we focus on Markov-perfect equilibria. We then calibrate our infinite horizon model to match the features of emerging market crises and experiment with degrees of leakages ranging from 0 to 50% of agents making up the unregulated sphere of the economy.====The main take away from our quantitative analysis is that even subject to significant leakages, macroprudential policy remains highly effective and desirable. To offset the increase in borrowing by the unregulated sector, the planner induces even tighter regulation on the regulated sector, and this results in aggregate levels of borrowing that are comparable to the constrained-efficient allocation. Average welfare gains are fairly stable with respect to leakages. Nonetheless, the welfare gains are spread unevenly in the economy, with the lion's share going to unregulated agents. Intuitively, while the financial stability benefits of macroprudential policy are partially offset by the burden of regulation for regulated agents, they are not for unregulated agents, who free-ride on others’ precautionary behavior.",Macroprudential policy with leakages,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000915,25 July 2022,2022,Research Article,68.0

The dollar's share in global trade invoicing, international debt, and cross-border non-bank borrowing outstrips the share of the United States in trade, international bond issuance, and cross-border borrowing and lending. The currency's dominance has been resilient in the face of a declining U.S. share of global GDP. Dollar dominance survived the collapse of Bretton Woods (Gourinchas, 2021), while its shares of international debt and non-bank borrowing rose still further following the global financial crisis (Eren and Malamud, 2021).====Influential contributions (e.g., Prasad, 2014) argue that the dollar has been the dominant international currency by default. The absence of alternatives has allowed it to dominate international funding markets, trade invoicing and settlement, and foreign exchange reserves. Other currencies suffer from an inadequate supply of investment-grade government securities for investors to hold as safe assets and central banks to accumulate as reserves (Eichengreen and Gros, 2020). Or their liquidity and availability is limited by regulation, including capital controls (Prasad and Ye, 2013; and Sullivan, 2020). They do not benefit from the large installed base of transactions denominated in dollars. They therefore lack the complementarities and synergies of different cross-border uses benefiting the dollar (Gopinath and Stein, 2021).====But with the rise of the euro and the renminbi, this narrative continues, the situation may be poised to change. Starting in 2012, with Mario Draghi's “do whatever it takes” pledge, the European Central Bank asserted its readiness to act as liquidity provider of last resort to markets in euro-denominated assets in countries using the euro (European Commission, 2018). In 2020, with the creation of the €850 billion European Recovery Fund, there arose the prospect of a growing stock of safe and liquid AAA-rated government securities to be held as reserves by central banks (Hudecz et al., 2021).====China, meanwhile, embarked on a process of currency internationalization, aided by growing imports and exports, Belt and Road investments, a global network of renminbi currency swaps and official clearing banks, and addition of the renminbi to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket (Subacchi, 2016; Greene, 2021). The capstone on this evolution, it is said (Jia, 2021), is now issuance by China of a central bank digital currency, the e-CNY.====In this paper, we focus on the currency composition of international reserves. On this dimension, the dollar has not become more dominant. It has not even maintained the dominance of prior years. Fig. 1 shows the currency composition of foreign exchange reserves according to the IMF's Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) survey. According to this source, the share of reserves held in U.S. dollars by central banks dropped by 12 percentage points since the turn of the century, from 71% in 1999 to 59% in 2021.====This decline is not an inadvertent byproduct of changes in exchange rates, interest rate levels, or interest rate differentials. To the contrary, reserve managers have tended to rebalance their portfolios, restoring prior currency shares, to offset such changes. The decline is not the result of reserve accumulation by a small number of large reserve holders with a preference for non-dollar currencies. Nor is it a figment of changes in country or currency coverage of surveys of reserve composition. Rather, it reflects active portfolio diversification by central bank reserve managers.====Fig. 1 shows that this decline in the dollar's share is not a shift toward the euro, the British pound sterling and Japanese yen—the other currencies that, historically, have played a significant international role and, along with the dollar, that have comprised the basket making up the IMF's Special Drawing Rights.==== Though there was a rise in the share of reserves in euros after the turn of the century, this increase was not sustained. This is contrary to widespread expectations that the euro would come to play a more consequential international role and challenge the dollar's dominant reserve currency status (see e.g., Chinn and Frankel, 2007, Chinn and Frankel, 2008).====As a result, the decline in the dollar's share has been matched by a rise in the share of what we refer to as nontraditional reserve currencies, defined as currencies other than the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and British pound sterling. As shown in Fig. 1, the share of nontraditional reserve currencies rose from negligible levels at the turn of the century to roughly $1.2 trillion and 10% of total identified reserves in 2021. Using data from the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and national sources, we show that the shift away from the dollar has been a quarter a shift into the Chinese renminbi and three quarters a shift into other nontraditional reserve currencies. The renminbi has long been thought to pose a challenge to the dollar (see Subramanian, 2011 for an early statement). However, not only is it starting out well behind the greenback, but the shift out of dollars, in fact, is not overwhelmingly a shift into the renminbi, as we show below. Rather, the shift out of dollars is more substantially a shift into the currencies of smaller economies that, historically, had less of the scale and liquidity needed to constitute an attractive form of international reserves.====This shift into nontraditional reserve currencies is substantial, and it is also broad based. We identify 46 “active diversifiers,” defined as countries with a share of official reserves in nontraditional currencies of at least 5% at the end of 2020.====Three factors contribute to the growing footprint of nontraditional reserve currencies. First is the growing liquidity of markets. Historically, only a handful of countries have possessed deep and liquid markets in domestic-currency assets open to the rest of the world. Foreign exchange dealers, able to find counterparties only in that same handful of currencies, quoted and transacted in a limited number of bilateral exchange rates. Canales-Kriljenko (2004, p.7) describes how the principal currencies traded in the foreign exchange markets of developing countries at the turn of the century were the dollar, euro, pound sterling, and Japanese yen (currencies sometimes labelled the “Big Four”). He illustrates this by explaining that the cheapest way of purchasing Canadian dollars with Mexican pesos was by first purchasing U.S. dollars with Mexican pesos and then using the U.S. dollars to purchase Canadian dollars, reflecting the high liquidity and low transactions costs of markets for U.S. dollars.====But as transactions costs have fallen with the advent of electronic trading platforms and now automated market-making (AMM) and automated liquidity management (ALM) technologies for foreign exchange transactions, the savings associated with transacting in U.S. dollars are less. Meanwhile, a growing number of countries have developed markets for trading currencies other than the Big Four.==== In addition, the expanding global network of central bank currency swap lines (Aizenman et al., 2021) has enhanced the ability of central banks to access currencies other than the ones they hold as reserves, weakening these links across markets and functions.====Second, central bank reserve managers have become more active in chasing returns. Central banks have accumulated substantial portfolios of financial assets. The larger the portfolio, the more scope there is for financial gains (and also, to be sure, losses) from active reserve management. When reserves exceed the level associated with reserve adequacy, reserve managers come to distinguish different reserve tranches: the minimum required for reserve adequacy (the “liquidity tranche”), which should be held in liquid, low-risk assets; and the rest (the “investment tranche”), which can be more actively managed, with returns in mind, and invested in less liquid assets (Hentov et al., 2019).==== The liquidity tranche is used to finance ongoing deficits, service and redeem debt, and intervene in the foreign exchange market, and as such tends to be held in the same relatively liquid assets denominated in the same currencies against which intervention is conducted. The investment tranche can be placed in nontraditional instruments and currencies. As the investment tranche grows relative to the liquidity tranche, one should expect to see more diversification in this direction.====Third, and relatedly, as yields on bonds issued by the governments of the Big Four countries have fallen toward zero, central bank reserve managers may have intensified their search for higher yielding alternatives.==== As we show below, Sharpe Ratios (returns adjusted for volatility) have been more attractive for nontraditional currencies than the Big Four at a variety of points in the last decade.====In contrast, the data do not suggest that emerging markets (EMs) have swapped dollar reserves for nontraditional reserve currencies as a hedge for commodity terms of trade shocks. It is true that some nontraditional reserve currencies (e.g., Australian dollar, Canadian dollar) are seen as “commodity currencies,” given their positive correlation with commodity prices. But if this argument were to be correct, then we would see only commodity-importing EMs moving into these currencies. But, as we show (Table 6), the move toward nontraditional currencies is broad-based across a wide spectrum of EMs that include both commodity importing and exporting countries.====In sum, several factors have combined to prompt the shift from dollars to nontraditional reserve currencies in recent decades. The literature on reserve diversification (potential as well as actual) has tended to emphasize policy initiatives on the part of the official sector that fly under the banner of, inter alia, “renminbi internationalization” and fostering internationalization of the euro to boost Europe's “strategic autonomy” (Reuters, 2020; Economist, 2021). Our analysis suggests that market forces and incentives matter at least as much as these policy measures.====Our paper builds on several literatures. Most obvious is the literature on dollar dominance. Gopinath and Stein (2021), already mentioned, emphasize mutually reinforcing synergies between use of the dollar in trade and bank-intermediated capital flows, while Farhi and Maggiori (2017) emphasize complementarities between dollar invoicing and the demand for dollar-denominated assets. Another related topic is the literature on graduation from original sin (Ocampo et al., 2020; Bordo et al., 2002). Some claim that by now a fair share of emerging markets are hedged in ways that mitigate their balance sheet exposure (Engel and Park, 2018; Han, 2022). This may have changed the costs of exchange rate volatility and affected the currency composition of reserve assets. Also closely related is the literature on network effects and liquidity in foreign exchange markets. The literature on network effects (e.g., Matsuyama et al., 1993; Rey, 2001) suggests that it pays to use and therefore for central banks to hold the same national currency used and held by others engaged in international transactions, since only that currency, or small handful of currencies, is widely priced and accepted, and since foreign exchange transactions are costly. Ogawa and Muto (2018) focus on liquidity and suggest that only large economies possess deep and liquid markets open to the rest of the world, thereby rendering their currencies attractive as international reserves.====Skeptics of this view (e.g., Eichengreen et al., 2018; Eichengreen, 2019) question the importance of these complementarities between different international uses of a currency. They argue that as financial markets and relations develop, the case for a central bank to hold its reserves in the same currency that exporters invoice or banks borrow becomes weaker; they envisage movement toward a more multipolar (multiple-currency) international monetary and reserve system. They point to the declining importance of network effects in an increasingly high-tech financial world and emphasize changes in market technology that reduce the cost and increase the ease of transacting in nontraditional international currencies.====Our paper is directly related to the empirical literature on the composition of foreign reserves. Eichengreen and Frankel (1996), Eichengreen (1998), and Chinn and Frankel (2007) have used published COFER aggregates to model the determinants of reserve currency shares and forecast their future evolution. Dooley et al. (1989) and Mathieson and Eichengreen (2000) used confidential country-level data underlying the COFER data base to explore the determinants of country-level reserve currency shares.==== Eichengreen and Mathieson found a striking degree of stability in the currency composition of reserves between the 1980s and 1990s and highlighted the importance of trade flows and debt denomination as determinants of currency shares.====As an alternative to the COFER data, Iancu et al. (2020) analyze data published by central banks. They assemble data on the reserves of 42 countries for the period 1999–2018. They conclude that financial links play an increasingly important role in the currency composition of reserves and that inertia in reserve proportions remains important. They find little evidence that trade shares significantly affect reserve composition, regardless of whether the former is measured as the share of trade with the reserve-currency country or the share invoiced in its currency. Similarly, Ito and McCauley (2020) use data published by 58 central banks. They find that dollar invoicing of exports is an important determinant of dollar reserve shares, and that countries hold larger dollar shares when their domestic currency co-moves with the dollar.====In the paper most closely related to our own, Aizenman et al. (2020) assemble data for 58 countries from reports to the IMF on reserves in the form of nontraditional currencies (other than the dollar, euro, yen, and sterling).==== They find that countries that trade more with the US, Euro Area, Japan, and UK and that peg to their currencies hold a larger share of Big Four reserves; in addition, central banks diversify away from the dollar and other traditional reserve currencies as their reserve portfolios grow large. However, these authors do not distinguish changes in the shares of the renminbi and other nontraditional reserve currencies, as we do here.====Finally, there is a literature on rebalancing by central bank reserve managers. Dominguez et al. (2012) analyze aggregate reserve accumulation; they distinguish between active reserve accumulation, resulting from purchases and sales of reserve assets, and passive accumulation, resulting from returns on reserve assets. In contrast to that paper, we use this decomposition to study changes in the currency composition of reserves rather than changes in total reserves. We also use total return indices to estimate valuation changes in reserve assets, whereas they use balance of payments estimates. Chinn et al. (2022) use their country-level sample to test for rebalancing: they reject both no rebalancing and full rebalancing, where the extent of rebalancing increases with country and reserve-portfolio size. Also related is Truman and Wong (2006), who analyze published data on reserve composition for 23 central banks for the period 2000–04. They compare changes in reserve shares with and without exchange-rate valuation effects but do not consider rebalancing per se. Utilizing this same sample, Wong (2007) finds evidence of partial rebalancing for some countries, notably Japan, but not others. In contrast to these earlier studies, our analysis of rebalancing builds on a larger sample of central banks and encompasses a more recent period.====SectionII describes at more length trends and possible determinants of recent changes in the share of the dollar in international reserves.

By positioning themselves between and coordinating the interaction of various groups of economic agents, they have been able to exploit both direct and indirect network effects. Managing these forces is no easy task, but when things fall into place the potential for growth is extremely large. In their wake, traditional industries have been transformed and new ones created. Such changes disrupt not only existing businesses but also raise regulatory and policy questions about how to govern this new landscape.====These platforms present a particular challenge for trade agreements, especially an institution like the WTO which was designed with a pre-FANG world in mind. This is not to say that the WTO has completely ignored the changing technological environment.==== Two agreements stand out as being a direct response to new technologies and the business models they generate; the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and the e-commerce moratorium. These initiatives reflect a desire to maintain relatively open markets in sectors and products that have both high potential for growth and productivity enhancing innovations. Nevertheless, these agreements are relatively tentative in as much as they are limited in product scope, duration and/or in the number of members who have committed to be bound by their disciplines. Such wariness also seems natural given that technology firms, and the FANG's in particular, now enjoy large market shares, leading to a related concern over the market power this implies.====Efforts to evaluate these agreements have followed a familiar template of utilizing either quantitative partial/general equilibrium models or estimating gravity equations, see for example EU (2016) and WTO (2017). While these methods are the typical tools employed to evaluate any trade agreement, they have not been adapted to capture the types of considerations that underpin the success of the FANG's, namely their platform/two-sided structure. By ignoring such issues, these studies run the risk of providing an incomplete or potentially misleading picture of the consequences of agreements like the ITA. It also leaves open a number of challenging questions. What does international trade in a world with FANG's look like? Do trade policies, such as tariffs, have standard effects? If we were to negotiate a trade agreement covering products associated with these platform industries what would/should it do?====In order to answer these questions, we construct a simple model of international trade in a platform industry. The basic structure is inspired by the closed economy models of two-sided markets pioneered by Rochet Jean-Charles and Jean Tirole (2003), McCalman (2006), Armstrong and Mark (2006), Hagiu (2009) and Weyl (2010). Extending these models to an international setting requires both a change of emphasis and the introduction of new considerations.==== Even so, the resulting framework captures the central feature of two-sided markets – a platform takes into account the indirect network effects that arise across the two sides of the platform. In particular, the value received on one side of the market depends on the number of participants on the other side. To help fix ideas, think of the video game industry or the iPhone ecosystem. No one would be interested in purchasing a Nintendo gaming console unless there are games to play on it. Similarly, no game developers would spend the time and capital to design a game if no one owned a game console. The problem for a company like Nintendo is that it must try to coordinate the behavior of both sides of the market. If it charges too much for its consoles, then poor console sales set off a death spiral as no games will be developed either. If it charges too much for developer kits or too high a royalty rate on games, then developers won’t design games for the console. Resolving these issues and facilitating the sale of games between gamers and developers is the central challenge of the platform.====The structure we develop reflects these considerations; as in Armstrong and Mark (2006) a monopoly platform must choose a set of prices to encourage both sides of a market to adopt the platform to interact/transact. The economic value derives solely from this interaction and all choices of the platform are made to not only nurture this value but also to try to capture as much of it as possible. The video game example also motivates the international dimension of the analysis and guides the changes to the underlying Armstrong set-up. First, the model is extended to included more detail about the interactions/transactions that take place on the platform. In particular, the variety of offerings is an important source of value. To reflect this we model transactions on the platform as monopolistically competitive. The second modification captures the feature that the platform and developers are geographically co-located/concentrated while consumption is internationally dispersed. That is, most countries are home to consumers of platform products and services while only a very small number host the platforms or developers/sellers.====The introduction of monopolistic competition and a geography of consumption and production helps clarify the trade-offs for a typical country who is an importer of both the platform hardware (game console, iPhone) and the products transacted on them (games, apps). The game console/smart-phone examples also serve to highlight a distinctive feature of these platform environments; seemingly similar markets can have very different platform pricing structures. For example, both game consoles and smart-phones are basically computers. In fact, the bill of materials for these two products is very similar. They also share the feature that once a person has purchased the hardware, its value to them is higher the more games or apps there are available. Despite these similarities, the pricing of game consoles and smart-phones are very different. While an iPhone famously sells for many multiples of its bill of materials, a game console is typically sold for a price below its marginal cost.==== The additional structure we add by specifying monopolistically competitive interactions on the platform is especially useful for understanding why these prices differ and provides the basis for thinking about how trade policy might also have different implications from what we would normally expect from a single-sided market.====Unlike pricing in a one-sided market, which is determined by a combination of marginal costs and demand elasticities, prices in a two-sided setting also reflect the multiple sources of revenue and their relative importance. These additional factors can be so dominant that the role of marginal costs is relegated to a secondary consideration. To untangle the competing influences of each mechanism, our usual one-sided concept of marginal revenue can be used to determine the role that a side plays on a platform. This is particularly useful when determining whether a side is a “money-side” or a “subsidy-side”. Unlike the previous literature which has used these notions primarily in a descriptive manner, we find it useful to define a “money-side” as one where their one-sided marginal revenue is positive; and a “subsidy-side” where their one-sided marginal revenue is negative, where both are evaluated at the equilibrium outcome. This definition has the advantage of identifying the role that a side plays, not by a comparison of a price and a potentially miss-attributed marginal cost, but whether it makes a contribution to revenues at the margin. Moreover, it also says that a platform operates on the elastic segment of demand for a “money-side” and an inelastic segment for the “subsidy-side”.====This distinction then plays a central role when evaluating the impact of a tariff on prices and quantities. When a tariff is imposed on a “money-side”, it raises domestic prices (i.e. tariff inclusive price) in a way we have come to expect. Moreover, if domestic prices don’t rise by the full extent of the tariff, an importing country can increase national welfare via a tariff, but only at the expense of overall global welfare. This inefficiency is one reason to negotiate trade agreements – to offset or internalize the terms of trade effect. If instead an ad valorem tariff is imposed on a “subsidy-side” product, then the impact is completely reversed. That is, the domestic price declines and domestic platform participation increases. Moreover, both domestic and overall global welfare are higher with a tariff. That is, a tariff can raise efficiency! While the result that the domestic price can decline with a tariff is reminiscent of the Metlzer paradox (in a perfectly competitive model), a unilateral tariff in that setting must lower world welfare.====With a result so contrary to our understanding of how tariffs work, there might be a suspicion that it requires some exotic demand or cost functions. However, this isn’t the case and the intuition is relatively straight forward. Recall that a “subsidy-side” is defined as having a negative one-sided marginal revenue. So in choosing the optimal number of participants for that side, the platform equates the marginal revenue from both sides with the marginal cost. The marginal revenue consists of the one-sided marginal revenue from the “subsidy-side” along with the additional revenue it receives from the other side since the value of this side's participation is enhanced at the margin. In effect, the negative marginal revenue on the “subsidy-side” is just like a “marginal cost” of extracting rents from the cross-side. Remembering that a negative marginal revenue can be consistent with positive prices, a tariff is imposed on imports in the usual value based manner. Now since the platform makes decisions based on prices and marginal revenues net of tariffs (i.e. ==== and ====), it follows that the absolute value of the marginal revenue for the “subsidy-side” is lower. But this implies a lower “marginal cost” of extracting rents from the cross-side. Consequently, the platform will optimally increase participation on the “subsidy-side” (by lowering prices) not to extract rents from that side, but instead to extract rents from the cross-side, which is the “money-side”.====Since a tariff on the “subsidy-side” enhances global welfare, it is of interest to determine if and when this occurs. This is at least conceptually a straightforward matter: In a two-sided market, whenever import demand is inelastic, a tariff will have efficiency enhancing properties. To evaluate whether this arises empirically, we return to the video game example and estimate the elasticity of import demand for both hand-held and TV gaming consoles for 31 countries. For the majority of these countries the elasticity of demand for TV consoles are estimated to be inelastic. This result suggests that tariffs might make sense for these importers. Yet, this stands in contrast to the decision in 2015 to add TV gaming consoles to the list of products bound by zero tariffs under the extended ITA, with 26 countries in the sample party to this agreement. This raises the possibility that the decision to include video games in the ITA reflected the logic of a single-sided world, which is opposite of the policy advice that comes out of a more appropriate two-sided analysis.====To establish these results Section2 presents a simple model of two-sided markets for a closed economy, characterizing platform behavior and introduces the definitions for a “money-side” and a “subsidy-side”. This framework is then extended in Section3 to an open economy, where one country hosts both the platform and a side which we call sellers. In contrast, all the buyers are located in a separate country. We characterize the impact of a tariff on imported platform hardware, and demonstrate the centrality of the subsidy/money-side dichotomy in predicting outcomes. Finally, Section4 considers the issues associated with estimating import demand elasticities in the video game console market. After addressing these issues, import elasticities are presented allowing inferences to be drawn about the merits of committing to free trade in video game consoles.",Trade policy with FANG's (aka trade policy and multi-sided platforms),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000873,14 July 2022,2022,Research Article,70.0

Our analysis focuses on a neglected factor in the crisis: the role of the weak dollar in intra-EMS tensions. We provide new evidence of the contribution of a falling dollar-Deutschmark exchange rate to pressure on EMS currencies.","The 1992–3 crisis in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System was a seminal moment in Europe's monetary history. It underscored the fragility of pegged exchange rates and in so doing reinforced the commitment of European Union member states to complete the transition to monetary union.====Yet three decades on there is no consensus about the causes of the crisis. The literature, which is substantial, focuses on events internal to Europe. German reunification entailed an increase in deficit spending in that country, mainly on Germany's own products. It therefore required a higher price of German relative to other European goods (Branson, 1993). But with the Bundesbank pushing back against an acceleration in German inflation, and with real wage resistance limiting the scope for deflation in other countries, the only mechanism for this adjustment was a change in European exchange rates against the Deutschmark (DM), as brought about by the crisis. In this context, the Bundesbank's stubborn refusal to cut interest rates in order to relieve the pressure on other European central banks was a failure of international cooperation (Buiter et al., 2001).====Other accounts (e.g. Tietmeyer, 1998) blame not German reunification or the Bundesbank but chronic competitiveness problems in other countries. Sterling was overvalued at the parity at which it entered the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1990. Italian debts and deficits were too high. Banking systems were insolvent in the Scandinavian countries that shadowed the ERM.==== Still other authors (Eichengreen and Wyplosz, 1993) put the onus on political events, such as Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty on June 2, 1992, which made it seem less likely that monetary union would in fact occur, in turn weakening the incentive for other countries to maintain the high interest rates needed to hold their exchange rates stable within the ERM and qualify for euro adoption.====This focus on events in the crisis countries and region contrasts with the literature on other crises, which adds a role for external factors and emphasizes their importance. Analyses of historic currency and financial crises, such as that of 1873, focus on events in the major international financial centers (Davies, 2018). Treatments of the 1980s Latin American debt and currency crises point to the role of sharp increases in U.S. interest rates in precipitating a sudden stop of capital flows to emerging markets (ECLAC, 1996). The common creditor channel, whereby external creditors whose balance sheets are impaired as a result of investments in one country, draw down their exposure to others, is frequently cited as a channel for contagious currency crises (Kaminsky and Reinhart, 2000; Pesenti and Tille, 2000; Mitchener and Weidenmier, 2008).====Here we similarly add a role for developments outside Europe, specifically U.S. dollar weakness, in heightening monetary tensions within the EMS. Dollar weakness was associated with flows from the greenback to the DM, the closest substitute for the U.S. currency. As the DM rose against other ERM currencies, the latter were at risk of breaching their bilateral divergence margins. This phenomenon was recognized at the time; it was known as “dollar-Deutschmark polarization.”==== The implication was that the EMS crisis was imported, in substantial part, and not only home grown.====We provide two types of evidence for the role of the dollar. First, we draw on primary and secondary sources to document that contemporaries were aware and concerned about dollar weakness and dollar/DM polarization. Second, we show statistically that movements in the dollar/DM exchange rate explain a significant fraction of the pressure on EMS currencies in this period. The impact of the dollar/DM rate was large, both absolutely and relative to the internal factors (inter alia Bundesbank policy) emphasized in earlier literature. Depreciation of the dollar from $1.6 to $1.4 DM, not an atypical move in the period, has fully four times the impact on exchange market pressure of a 100 basis point increase in the Bundesbank policy rate. This highlights the importance of the channel emphasized here.====Our statistical analysis is based on new data on foreign-exchange market intervention by EMS central banks from 1986 to 1995, years spanning the crisis. We construct daily measures of exchange-market pressure. This allows for greater precision in distinguishing sources of pressure on ERM exchange rates, compared to previous studies that used monthly or even lower frequency data and/or were forced to neglect foreign-exchange market intervention. Our data were assembled by European central banks on a confidential basis; we are able to access them because of a change in policy governing the delay in making available to researchers material in the British official archives, including those of the Bank of England, which shortened the period of delay from 30 to 20 years.====A few previous studies have touched on the role of the dollar in the crisis (see e.g. Harmon and Heisenberg, 1993; Edison and Kole, 1995; Eichengreen, 2002; Truman, 2002; James, 2012; Gros, 2014; James, 2020), but none has developed this point fully, much less provided statistical evidence. There is also a handful of studies of dollar/Deutschmark polarization (Brown, 1979; Giavazzi and Giovannini, 1989; Haldane and Hall, 1991; Forder and Hurn, 2003), but these precede or otherwise do not link the phenomenon to the 1992–3 crisis.====Section 2 introduces and describes our data, after which Section 3 uses them to construct a composite measure of exchange-market pressure, which we then use in Section 4 to provide a new perspective on the crisis. In 5 The role of the dollar, 6 Evidence on the impact of the dollar/DM rate we present our evidence of the role of dollar weakness, after which Section 7 concludes.

Voters in areas more exposed to trade liberalization with China in 2000 subsequently shift their support toward Democrats, relative to the 1990s, though this boost for Democrats wanes after the rise of the Tea Party in 2010. House members’ votes in Congress rationalize these trends, with Democratic representatives disproportionately supporting protection during the early 2000s. Together, these results imply that voters in areas subject to higher import competition shifted votes toward the party more likely to restrict trade.","While international trade has long been a contentious issue in US elections, it has become even more controversial in the last two decades, as a surge in imports from China coincided with a steep decline in manufacturing employment. As a result, understanding the relationship between trade and elections is increasingly important, both for its reflection of the underlying distributional effects of trade, as well as its implications for future policy. In this paper, we examine the link between US trade liberalization with China and election voting, and then investigate whether legislators’ policy choices rationalize this relationship.====We begin with an analysis of how votes cast for federal office-seekers respond to a substantial change in US trade policy, the granting of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to China in 2000, that effectively eliminated the possibility of a trade war between the two countries. We measure an area's exposure to this liberalization via the industry structure of the county, and relate this exposure to the share of votes cast for each party in elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Presidency.====Using a difference-in-differences empirical strategy, we provide novel evidence on the relationship between trade liberalization and party vote shares. In particular, we find that in the first decade after PNTR, counties more exposed to the change in policy exhibit relative increases in the share of votes cast for Democrats ==== the 1990s, a relationship that has not been previously uncovered. Coefficient estimates suggest that moving a county from the 25th to the 75th percentile of exposure is associated with a 2.2 percentage point relative increase in the share of votes cast for Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives, a sizable impact compared to the 49 percent Democratic vote share in the 2000 Congressional election. This reaction is most evident in elections for the House, in line with that body being more sensitive to local concerns than the Senate or the Presidency. We find a a less-pronounced effect in elections for the Senate, and no statistically significant relationship for Presidential elections or for voter turnout.====In the second portion of the paper, we provide a potential explanation for why voters shifted support toward Democrats in the early 2000s. Using a regression discontinuity analysis comparing the legislative votes of Democratic and Republican representatives who win election by small margins, we find that Democrats in the early 2000s were significantly more likely to vote to restrict international trade than their Republican counterparts. We attribute Democrats’ anti-trade positions in the early 2000s, in part, to opposition to a pro-trade Republican President, which represented a shift from being more supportive of trade during the Clinton Presidency in the 1990s. Combined with the earlier results for election voting, these findings suggest that voters in areas more exposed to import competition via PNTR were more likely to vote for Democrats in House elections in the early 2000s because representatives from that party were more likely to vote against expanding international trade.====While our main results focus on changes in the first decade of the 2000s, relative to the 1990s, we also extend our analysis to 2016 and the election of Donald Trump. During this second decade of the 2000s, high-profile Republicans began adopting more anti-trade positions, and a perception emerged that voters in areas with large increases in import competition were shifting their votes toward these anti-trade Republicans. Indeed, we find that areas more exposed to PNTR experience relative increases in the favorability of the “Tea Party”—a wing of the Republican party whose views included hostility toward trade agreements—and the number of Tea Party activists. We also find evidence consistent with these moves in our analyses of elections and legislative voting, though we caution that relationships in this latter period are imprecisely estimated. Specifically, we find that the positive relationship between exposure to PNTR and the Democratic vote share disappears by 2016 and that Republicans vote similarly or even more anti-trade than Democrats from 2012 to 2016.====We perform our baseline analysis of election voting at the county-level because county borders are largely stable over time, allowing us to track voting information consistently over long periods that span the redrawing of Congressional districts after each decennial Census. This consistency is important because it allows us to observe outcomes before and after the policy change and also before and after the 2000 to 2002 redistricting period, when a large share of the employment decline during our sample period occurs. Nonetheless, because Congressional elections are determined at the district-, rather than the county-level, we construct a crosswalk using county-district population shares that allows us to examine election data at the district level over our sample period. These constructed district-level data yield results that are qualitatively identical to the county-level baseline.====Our paper relates to the growing literature on the relationship between trade and political outcomes in both political science and economics, with recent research focusing on the trade policy preferences of voters and legislators, and the polarization of the electorate. Margalit (2011), for example, uses plant-level information on Trade Adjustment Assistance to determine that voters are more sensitive to job loss due to foreign competition than other factors. Conconi et al. (2012) find that the import or export exposure of US Congressional districts determines how members of Congress vote on bills to grant Fast Track Authority to the President for trade negotiations.====In regards to trade with China, Feigenbaum and Hall (2015) provide the first evidence on the relationship between Chinese imports and political outcomes, examining their impact on the roll-call behavior of legislators and electoral outcomes. They find that legislators from districts experiencing larger increases in Chinese imports become more protectionist in their voting on trade-related bills, and that incumbents are able to insulate themselves from electoral competition via their voting behavior.==== Our finding that exposure to PNTR is associated with relative increases in Tea Party activity, but not with an increase in the probability of a Tea Party candidate being elected, is consistent with these results.====More recently, Autor et al. (2020) show that increased Chinese import competition has led to increased political polarization, in terms of the partisan rankings of members of Congress, recipients of political contributions, and cable news viewership. These authors also find that majority-white Congressional districts that experience larger increases in Chinese imports become more likely to elect conservative Republicans to the House, while majority-minority districts become more likely to elect liberal Democrats during that period, with a relative increase in the probability of electing a Republican candidate, on net. Their analysis is conducted with county-district pairs that aggregate to the district-level via weighting, and covers the years 2002 to 2016.====Our analysis provides new information on the relationship between import competition and voting, relative to Autor et al. (2020), while also being broadly consistent with their results. Importantly, because our sample begins in 1992, and compares outcomes in the 2000s to those in the 1990s, we find a shift toward support for Democrats that is not apparent without a comparison to the earlier period. However, when we extend our analysis through 2016, we find that the shift toward Democrats that peaks in 2008 unwinds in the 2010s, indicating a movement back toward Republican candidates in trade-exposed areas, consistent with Autor et al. (2020).====Our paper makes several additional contributions to this literature. First, we exploit a major change in U.S. trade policy as part of our identification strategy to examine the relationship between trade and political outcomes. Second, as mentioned, our analysis covers a longer time period than previous studies, thereby uncovering a shift towards and then away from Democrats, relative to the 1990s, that is not apparent in shorter time horizons. Third, we provide evidence of an economic rationale for the observed voting behavior by showing that voters in areas more exposed to increased import competition via PNTR shifted their votes toward Democrats when Democratic representatives were, in fact, more likely to restrict trade. Finally, we consider the relationship between this policy shock and voting in a range of national political offices, as well as voter turnout.====Our research also relates to a group of papers that establish a causal link between increased import competition and a range of socio-economic outcomes, highlighting the distributional implications of trade. Autor et al. (2013) show that local labor markets subject to larger increases in imports from China experience relative increases in the uptake of disability insurance, along with declines in manufacturing employment. Greenland and Lopresti (2016) document an increase in high school graduation rates in import-competing areas, and Greenland et al. (2019) show that these areas experience relative reductions in population growth. Feler and Senses (2017) find that the provision of public goods decreases in these areas as property tax revenue falls, and Feler and Senses (2017) and Che et al. (2018) show that they also experience relative increases in property crime. Pierce and Schott (2020) find that counties with greater exposure to PNTR exhibit increases in mortality due to drug overdoses and Autor et al. (2019) find that US regions with rising imports from China exhibit changes in marriage and fertility patterns.====Finally, the results in this paper offer context for the 2016 election of Donald Trump, who adopted tariff increases with far-ranging effects, underscoring the important policy implications of elections. Amiti et al. (2019) and Fajgelbaum et al. (2019) find welfare losses resulting from recent US tariffs on China, with Flaaen et al. (2020), Waugh (2019), Flaaen and Pierce (2019), and Bown et al. (2020) providing further detail on the trade-offs that can arise between protecting firms and harming consumers and downstream industries. Blanchard et al. (2019) find that Republicans in trade-exposed areas lost electoral support in the 2018 Congressional elections, while Fetzer and Schwarz (2019) and Fajgelbaum et al. (2019) examine whether other countries’ retaliatory tariffs are geographically targeted.====We proceed as follows. Section 2 describes the growth of China as a US trade partner and focus of political discourse, and Section 3 describes construction of variables and data sources. Section 4 presents our empirical strategy and results examining the relationship between exposure to trade liberalization and voting. Section 5 explores the robustness of the baseline results for House of Representatives elections, and Section 6 extends the analysis through 2016.

Household survey data from Nigeria show a significant agricultural supply response that is correlated with exposure to international markets. Lowering trade costs and boosting agricultural productivity can help offset the lost income from oil.","After over a decade of increasing and high values interrupted only briefly by the 2008 financial crisis, world crude oil prices fell by over 75% from June 2014 to January 2016 and have remained relatively low since then, with partial recoveries only during periods of coordinated production cuts by major exporters (Fig. 1). The initial fall in price was primarily due to supply-side factors, including the rapid expansion of US shale oil production using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling (Stocker et al., 2018). In the longer term, environmental policies and improvements in energy efficiency are expected to lead to increasing decarbonization of economic activity, with a peak in global demand for oil by the mid-2030s (Brandt et al., 2013, Dale and Fattouh, 2018). The combination of increasing supply from new sources and decreasing demand means that historical oil exporters are likely to have less income from oil for the foreseeable future (Venables, 2016).====A long literature in economics has documented the ways in which natural resource revenues can affect economic outcomes, with an ongoing debate about whether they can in some circumstances be considered a “curse” (Sachs and Warner, 2001, Alexeev and Conrad, 2009). An important strand of this literature has highlighted how resource revenues can cause tradable sectors to contract as the appreciation of the real exchange rate draws factors of production into non-tradable sectors, an effect commonly known as Dutch disease (Corden, 1984). When productivity growth in tradable sectors like manufacturing is enhanced by learning-by-doing and spillovers, this reorientation of the economy towards non-tradables can have a negative effect on income in the long run (van Wijnbergen, 1984). Conversely, a decrease in resource revenues like that experienced by oil-rich economies since 2014 should lead to “reverse Dutch disease,” with factors of production flowing back into tradable sectors.====This paper seeks to assess the prospects for reverse Dutch disease in the oil-rich economies of sub-Saharan Africa. I focus primarily on Nigeria and Angola — the region's largest oil producers — but also include data from five members of the CEMAC customs and monetary union (Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Cameroon, and Chad). Generally speaking, these countries have historically had a comparative advantage in agriculture and were major agricultural exporters prior to their surge in oil revenues. It is the agricultural sector, therefore, rather than the manufacturing sector, that has been most affected by Dutch disease (Benjamin et al., 1989). I document that Nigeria, Angola, and the CEMAC have become major agricultural importers since they started exporting oil. Their net oil exports are negatively correlated with their net agricultural exports and positively correlated with the share of non-tradable crops in their total agricultural production.====An important feature of the agricultural sector in sub-Saharan Africa is trade costs much larger than elsewhere in the world — both internal, overland trade costs within countries and external, oversea trade costs to and from the world market (Porteous, 2019). Trade costs due to poor infrastructure, information costs, and policy barriers can prevent price signals from reaching isolated local markets. While trade costs may have helped cushion the effects of Dutch disease on the agricultural sector as resource revenues in Africa's oil exporters grew, they may also limit the stimulating effects of reverse Dutch disease as revenues fall.====To help understand the effects of changes in resource revenues in a context with high trade costs, I build an initial, stylized model of costly trade between three locations — an Interior region home to the agricultural sector, a Coast region home to the manufacturing sector, and the World. Both the Interior and the Coast receive resource revenues, leading factors of production to shift into local non-tradables. As resource revenues rise, the country passes through five distinct trade regimes as it transitions from exporting the agricultural good to importing it. Numerical simulations show that the effects of a change in resource revenues on farmers depend crucially on the trade regime. In the two regimes in which the agricultural sector is isolated from the world market, farmers are better off with higher resource revenues because the agricultural good behaves like a non-tradable good.====Empirical evidence from four waves of panel data from Nigeria's LSMS-ISA household surveys (2010, 2012, 2015, and 2018) suggests that declining resource revenues are already leading to reverse Dutch disease. Since the fall in oil prices, households have shifted both labor and land into agriculture, with larger shifts in areas that have experienced greater reductions in resource revenues. The number of farmers cultivating tradable crops has increased, while the number cultivating non-tradable crops has declined. Consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model, the magnitude of the supply response is negatively correlated with distance to an international border, a proxy for internal trade costs.====In a series of counterfactual experiments, I use an expanded, more realistic version of the model calibrated specifically to Nigeria to explore the effects of different policy approaches to the decline in oil revenues. The expanded model features multiple regions each producing agricultural and manufactured goods in addition to local non-tradables, with non-homothetic preferences, imperfect labor mobility across sectors, and heterogeneous productivity parameters, trade costs, and shares of national resource revenues. My simulations suggest that the 2014–2016 oil price drop led to welfare losses for farmers in the more isolated regions of northern Nigeria and welfare gains for farmers in the less isolated regions of southern Nigeria. The losses and gains in these respective regions were magnified by the increase in external trade costs (through import restrictions) that Nigeria subsequently implemented. If oil revenues fall further, higher external trade costs can eventually lead to worse outcomes for all farmers by hindering the transition to exporting. A preferable alternative for the agricultural sector is a sequential lowering of internal trade costs followed by external trade costs as the country transitions between trade regimes. When coupled with sufficient increases in agricultural productivity, the gains from this policy approach can completely offset the losses in overall welfare for the country as a whole due to the decline in oil revenues.====This paper contributes to the large literature on natural resource revenues more generally and Dutch disease more specifically by connecting it to a more recent literature highlighting the importance of trade costs in developing countries, particularly in the agriculture sector and in Africa. The theory of Dutch disease was developed by Corden and Neary (1982) and Corden (1984), who contrast a booming resource sector with a lagging manufacturing sector, which suffers from a resource movement effect due to the increased demand for factors of production in the booming sector and a spending effect due to the increase in the relative price of non-tradables. In a study of Dutch disease in Cameroon, (Benjamin et al., 1989) note that the resource sector in developing countries is typically an enclave sector using few local factors of production, that the imperfect substitutability of some locally-produced goods in tradable sectors can lead them to behave more like non-tradables, and that the lagging tradable sector is typically agriculture rather than manufacturing, all of which are features that I incorporate in my model. This focus on agriculture as the primary tradable sector differs from the traditional focus of the Dutch disease literature on manufacturing, which is often assumed to have greater potential for productivity growth and learning externalities (Matsuyama, 1992). However, the literature on agriculture in developing countries has shown that many countries have experienced rapid, sustained agricultural productivity growth over the last 60 years due to the adoption of new, high-yielding varieties and associated inputs (Pingali, 2012, Gollin et al., 2021) and that both learning-by-doing and learning-from-others externalities are empirically important in the adoption of new agricultural technologies (Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995, Conley and Udry, 2010, Lerva, 2021). Since my focus here is on the reallocation of factors of production across sectors as resource revenues change in the short to medium run, I do not model long-run endogenous productivity improvements explicitly, although I do simulate the effects of increases in agricultural productivity (which could be the result of endogenous learning or of policies like input subsidies or agricultural extension) in my counterfactuals.====In the more recent literature on resource-rich developing countries, Dutch disease effects have been seen as one of a number of challenges in translating resource revenues into economic growth (see Venables, 2016 for a review). The case of Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and largest oil exporter, has drawn particular attention, with studies highlighting the role of institutional quality and the volatility of public expenditure (Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian, 2013, Budina et al., 2007). In terms of Dutch disease-driven sectoral shifts, Nyatepe-Coo (1994) documents the dramatic contraction of export-oriented agriculture and surge in demand for agricultural imports in Nigeria during the oil price spikes of the 1970s and early 1980s, Nkang (2018) uses a computable general equilibrium model of Nigeria's economy to predict that the drop in world oil prices in 2014–2015 will lead to an increase in agricultural production, decrease in agricultural imports, and increase in agricultural exports due to the depreciation of the real exchange rate, and Abalo (2020) uses a Roy model calibrated with Nigeria's 2015 LSMS-ISA household survey data to explore the heterogeneous effects of reverse Dutch disease on different groups of workers.====This paper goes beyond the existing literature by introducing internal and external trade costs into a model of Dutch disease. The recent trade literature has highlighted the role of internal trade costs in determining the spatial distribution of economic activity within countries (Allen and Arkolakis, 2014). Coşar and Fajgelbaum (2016) show how internal trade costs can partition a country into an autarkic interior region and a trading coastal region, leading to spatially heterogeneous effects of increased openness to trade. An important strand of this literature has emphasized the role of major infrastructure projects historically in lowering trade costs for agricultural goods, enabling the realization of substantial gains from trade (Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2016, Donaldson, 2018). Several recent papers using spatial price data have found that trade costs in African countries are several times higher than elsewhere in the world, suggesting that a significant portion of these potential gains have yet to be realized (Atkin and Donaldson, 2015, Porteous, 2019). High trade costs in the spatially-dispersed agricultural sector have been shown to prevent specialization in crops of comparative advantage, adoption of productivity-enhancing inputs like fertilizer, and expansion of production in the most productive regions (Sotelo, 2020, Porteous, 2020). The initial, three-location open economy model used in this paper is closest to that of Gollin and Rogerson (2014), who use a three-location closed economy model calibrated with data from Uganda to show that high internal trade costs can help explain the large share of the workforce engaged in subsistence agriculture. Like these authors, I use my calibrated model to run counterfactual policy simulations in which I lower trade costs and increase agricultural productivity. However, my interest here is not on the direct impact of these policy interventions, but rather on how they can potentially alter the effects of an exogenous decline in resource revenues.",Reverse Dutch disease with trade costs: Prospects for agriculture in Africa's oil-rich economies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000836,28 June 2022,2022,Research Article,73.0

Although the discussion is certainly not novel – many emerging countries had resorted to macroprudential policy well before Lehman Brothers' demise on September 15, 2008 – it took an urgent undertone in light of the sudden realization of the severe contractionary forces that could be unleashed by the abrupt unwinding of financial imbalances and systemic risk. Perhaps one of the best examples of the renewed debate on macroprudential policy is the resurgence of the so-called “Tobin tax” – a financial tax on short-term capital inflows – whose popularity had arguably reached a low point by the mid-2000's, after gaining some limited popularity in previous decades thanks to its use by Chile.==== The mere fact that even the IMF has come out in favor of using Tobin taxes under some circumstances is a dramatic illustration of the search for new macroprudential policy tools in the post-Lehman world (see Ostry et al., 2010).====While there is a blossoming theoretical literature (e.g., Korinek, 2011; Bianchi et al., 2012; Bianchi et al., 2016; Mendoza, 2016; Jiménez et al., 2017; Bianchi and Mendoza, 2018; Cizel et al., 2019; Meeks, 2017; Aikman et al., 2019), the empirical evidence on the determinants and effects of macroprudential policy has been rather limited, mainly because of the absence of readily-available panel datasets on macroprudential tools for long spans of time and the lack of sound identification strategies. In fact, many studies rely on SVAR-type, time-identification assumptions which, as will be shown in this paper, constitute a very poor identification strategy. The empirical literature has generally focused on understanding the relationship between macroprudential and monetary policy in response to external shocks as well as assessing the effectiveness of macroprudential policy.====Most existing empirical studies, however, focus on a small set of countries (e.g., Vargas et al., 2010; Izquierdo et al., 2013) and/or a limited sample period (Gray, 2011; Claessens and Ghosh, 2012). Some exceptions include, for example, Federico et al. (2014) who show – using a quarterly legal reserve requirement dataset for 52 countries dating back as early as 1970 – that macroprudential policies are much more frequently changed in developing and emerging economies (on average, once every 2 years) than in industrial countries (on average, once every 12 years). In particular, they show that in developing and emerging economies, this frequent change in macroprudential policy follows a countercyclical behavior (i.e., central banks reduce reserve requirements during episodes of capital outflows and output contractions), typically acting as a substitute of monetary policy which, unlike industrial countries, is often procyclical (i.e., central bank policy interest rates increase during episodes of capital outflows and output contractions).==== In other words, during bad times, for example, when capital is flowing out and credibility is at a low point, monetary policy is used in a procyclical manner in order to defend the currency and fight inflationary pressures, while macroprudential policy provides a second instrument that is used for macroeconomic stabilization purposes.====When focusing on the effects of macroprudential policy, most studies typically analyze the impact on domestic credit conditions (e.g., Montoro and Moreno, 2011; Terrier et al., 2011; Crowe et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2011; Tovar et al., 2012) and economic activity (e.g. Glocker and Towbin, 2012). However, the effectiveness of macroprudential policy as a macroeconomic stabilizing tool is still very much an open question.====The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the empirical literature on the macroeconomic effects of macroprudential policy, by focusing on ==== reserve requirements (hereafter RR). The focus on RR is only natural for three main reasons: (i) RR are arguably the most common macroprudential tool especially in developing and emerging markets (Federico et al., 2014), (ii) collecting time series data on RR is, in principle, “easier” than collecting data on other prudential tools such as capital requirements (especially for long time spans), (iii) as is the case when using cyclically-adjusted revenue measures to assess changes in tax policy (e.g., Romer and Romer, 2010; Vegh and Vuletin, 2015; and Riera-Crichton et al., 2016), total banks' reserves (calculated as the ratio of banks deposits at the central bank to bank deposits) are not valid proxies for changes in policy instruments such as RR (Federico et al., 2014).====In particular, we push the empirical frontier on several crucial dimensions. First, in terms of measuring RR, while building upon existing data from Federico et al. (2014) that accounts for the different types of RR in terms of maturity and currency denomination, we now construct a novel metric of effective RR which also takes into account the structure of deposits. Second, in terms of the identification of exogenous RR shocks, we develop a Romer and Romer (2010) type of narrative for the nature of RR changes. When shocks to RR are properly identified as exogenous to the business cycle by using a narrative approach, we show that results change dramatically. In other words, we use changes in RR exogenous to the business cycle to analyze their macroeconomic effects, as opposed to those RR changes associated with the policy reaction function of the monetary authority to current or prospective output fluctuations. This is the quintessential problem of reverse causality. Third, since it proves impractical to analyze macroprudential policy in isolation, we also jointly analyze the macroeconomic effects of the central bank policy interest rate (IR, hereafter) on the macroeconomy. To properly identify exogenous IR shocks, we follow Romer and Romer's (2004) approach and purge the policy rate from systematic responses to information about future economic developments. Given the time-consuming efforts needed to carry out the analysis along these several critical dimensions, we focus our analysis on three Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay) since the early 1990s.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the novel RR dataset and some broad features of the data. Section 3 shows empirical evidence on the macroeconomic effects of macroprudential and monetary policies relying on traditional time-identifying assumptions. In line with the predictions of any standard macro model, we find a negative effect of central bank interest rate changes on output. Interestingly, we find a puzzling evidence regarding the effect of macroprudential policy on economic activity: macroprudential policy does ==== have effect on economic activity. We then turn to our new identifying strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance in this macroprudential literature in which such a narrative approach has been used. Section 4 discusses the narrative analysis and classifies the motivation for each RR change. Using historical documents, including IMF and central banks reports, we classify changes in RR into (i) ==== changes, which were mainly motivated by current or prospective output fluctuations (i.e., when output growth differs from normal) and (ii) ==== changes, which were triggered by reasons exogenous to the business cycle, including microprudential factors and financial liberalization. As discussed before, since it proves impractical to analyze macroprudential policy without considering the role of monetary policy, Section 5 extends the analysis to identify unanticipated IR shocks following Romer and Romer's (2004) approach. With our new measures of exogenous RR and IR shocks in hand, Section 6 examines their effects on output and also on market interest rate spreads (to have a sense of the transmission mechanism). These effects are estimated using Stock and Watson's (2018) methodology. Our series of exogenous changes might only capture part of the unobserved true structural shocks due to, for example, measurement errors. While measurement errors would lead to bias if the shock were treated as the true shock, they do not compromise the validity of the shocks as an instrument. Thus, as proposed by Stock and Watson (2018), rather than using our series of exogenous changes directly as shocks, we use them as instruments for the original series within the local projection framework of Jordà (2005). We show that refining the identification method proves to be critical to correctly assessing the output effects of changes in reserve requirements. In particular, when properly identified, the effect of reserve requirements on economic activity is ====. That is to say, an increase in reserve requirements reduces output growth while a cut in reserve requirements increases it. We show that the countercyclical nature of endogenous changes in reserve requirements is at the heart of this bias.

In the aftermath of the Great Recession, a debate has erupted among economists over whether to raise the inflation target further to, for example, 4 or 5% (e.g., Blanchard et al., 2010, Ball, 2014, Krugman, 2014). The main reason is that a higher target would ease the constraints on monetary policy arising from the zero bound on interest rates; this would result in less severe recessions. However, raising an inflation target over a sufficiently long period would eventually lead to higher long-run or trend inflation.==== In a world of integrated trade in goods and assets, sovereign nations have become increasingly interdependent. Higher domestic trend inflation would have a sizeable impact on foreign economies through its influence on international relative prices. How do shifts in a domestic inflation target affect other nations? What are the welfare implications for international cooperation among central banks?====Tackling these questions requires a two-country model with positive trend inflation. There exists a large and expanding literature that examines the macroeconomic consequences of positive trend inflation (e.g., King and Wolman, 1996, Ascari, 2004, Amano et al., 2007, Ascari and Ropele, 2007, Ascari and Ropele, 2009, Cogley and Sbordone, 2008, Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2011, Ascari and Sbordone, 2014, Ascari et al., 2018). Most models used in these studies are those of closed economy models. Few works on open-economy models allow for trend inflation. Fernandez-Corugedo (2007) considers the open-economy implications of trend inflation in both domestic and foreign economies but under the restrictive assumption of a unit elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. This assumption can deliver tractable solutions but will insulate the economy from terms of trade movements in steady states. Thus, only domestic trend inflation affects domestic variables in a steady state.==== This paper relaxes this assumption and examines how shifts in a domestic inflation target affect the foreign economy. Doing so also provides new insights into the implications of trend inflation on the business-cycle properties of open New Keynesian (NK) models in general.====The first contribution of this paper is an evaluation of the effects of increases in domestic trend inflation on foreign countries in an open economy with positive trend inflation. The model is calibrated to match key moment properties of the U.S. economy. The results show that based on the benchmark calibration, a domestic trend inflation increase from 0 to 8% leads to a domestic output loss of about 2.43% and a foreign output loss of about 0.01% each period. In the model, trend inflation affects the economy through four different channels. In addition to the standard channels of domestic price dispersion, intertemporal substitution, and expenditure-switching, trend inflation, through a new channel, has a “cross-country direct effect,” which tends to increase domestic output and decrease foreign output as domestic trend inflation increases. This effect is dominated, however, by the other three effects.====Second, by deriving a second-order log-approximation of the cooperative welfare function with trend inflation in the same way as Woodford (2003) and Alves (2014), I show that a welfare-concerned monetary authority would place a smaller weight on output gap volatility. This result is consistent with the findings of Ascari and Ropele (2007) and Alves (2014). However, in an open economy, different trend inflation in the two countries would also affect the relative weight of fighting output gap (and inflation) volatilities in both countries because different trend inflation will change the relative income between the two.====The cooperative optimal monetary policy under commitment derived with positive trend inflation in the open economy is more history-dependent than the one derived with zero trend inflation. The rule depends on the second lag of both output gaps and inflation of the two countries, whereas the one derived with zero trend inflation depends on the first lag of both output gaps and inflation (Corsetti et al., 2010). The optimal monetary policy derived with positive trend inflation in a closed economy depends on the second lag of the output gap and on the first lag of inflation (Alves, 2014). Consistent with the findings of Alves (2014), trend inflation also generates the “endogenous cost-push shock” in an open economy, which results in a breakdown of the “divine coincidence” (the monetary authority can simultaneously stabilize inflation and the output gap in response to efficient shocks; Blanchard and Galí, 2007). That is, the cooperative optimal monetary policy under commitment also faces a policy trade-off in response to efficient shocks, such as technology shocks.====Another contribution of this paper is an analysis of how trend inflation affects the business-cycle properties of open-economy NK models. I derive a more generalized expression for the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) in the sense that in addition to the Calvo pricing assumption, this model allows for positive trend inflation in all countries and assumes a non-unit elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. In response to technology shocks, domestic trend inflation amplifies the spillover effects of a domestic technology shock on foreign countries through the expenditure-switching effect, the intertemporal substitution effect, and the cross-country direct effect of trend inflation. Trend inflation in foreign countries reinforces these spillover effects through the effect of price dispersion. However, in the case of low persistent monetary policy shocks, trend inflation effects are quite limited.====Trend inflation also greatly affects the determinacy regions in Taylor rule's parameter space for open-economy models. More specifically, when two countries adopt an identical Taylor rule, the determinacy region shrinks rapidly as trend inflation rises. This indicates that the monetary policy should respond more aggressively to the deviation of the inflation rate from its target when trend inflation is high. This result is consistent with the findings of the literature on the impact of nonzero trend inflation on determinacy. For example, Ascari and Ropele (2009) examine how trend inflation alters the determinacy regions of Taylor rule's coefficients space. Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011) show that with positive trend inflation, the Taylor principle does not guarantee a determinate equilibrium. Ascari and Sbordone (2014) offer a comprehensive discussion of trend inflation and macroeconomic effects of implementing a monetary policy with a higher inflation target. The key findings of these works show that positive trend inflation shrinks the determinacy region of basic NK models when the monetary policy is implemented through a contemporaneous interest rate rule. Furthermore, in an open economy setting, this paper finds that increases in trend inflation in country B (from 0 to 8%) shrink the determinacy regions defined in the space of country A's Taylor rule parameters as well.====Finally, the welfare cost evaluation shows that welfare losses are sensitive to the level of trend inflation. In terms of unconditional consumption-equivalent losses, increasing trend inflation from 2 to 4% in the domestic country generates a loss of about 0.36% in the domestic country and 0.041% in the foreign country based on the benchmark calibration. Welfare gains from the optimal policy increase as trend inflation increases. Because this paper considers a standard NK model, the resulting domestic welfare cost of 0.36% is in line with much of the existing literature, which also abstracts from richer features. For instance, Ascari et al. (2018) show that in a simplified NK closed economy model, the welfare costs of increasing the trend inflation rate from 2 to 4% were less than 0.25% of each period's consumption. However, after incorporating factors, such as staggered wage contract, trend growth, roundabout production, extended working capital, and the interaction between trend inflation and a persistent marginal efficiency of investment shock, they show that the consumption-equivalent welfare loss increases to about 4% each period.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 presents the cooperative welfare-based loss function with trend inflation and cooperative optimal monetary policy under commitment in an open economy. Section 4 analyzes the quantitative implications of trend inflation. Section 5 discusses how trend inflation would change the determinacy regions of the model. Section 6 considers how trend inflation alters the dynamics of the macroeconomy in response to shocks and assesses the welfare costs of trend inflation.

We first re-confirm that the real exchange rate appreciates when external asset holdings increase, all else equal, a central mechanism in international economics. However, we find that increases in publicly held external assets (reserves) are associated with depreciation, especially if combined with high capital controls. Reserve accumulation is also associated with a larger trade surplus, and higher GDP and TFP growth, in countries with high capital controls. The results hold using an instrumental variable for reserves based on commodity export surrender requirements. A simple rationale is presented to account for the new fact: combined reserves and capital controls can affect trade balances via undervaluation (====), while reserve increases without controls can insure against crises (====) independently of real exchange rates.","In an old tradition stretching back centuries, via Keynes (1929), and at least as far as Hume (1742), the debate over the relative price levels of different countries—real exchange rates—and the international payments equilibrium stands out as one of oldest subjects in the field of economics. In the standard view, there is a steady-state equilibrium relationship between the level of the real exchange rate (RER) and the stock of net foreign assets (NFA): the real exchange rate should be more appreciated if net foreign assets rise to a higher level, all else equal.==== This standard prediction is intuitive: suppose the home country has a shock that generates higher net external wealth; home will desire to consume more accordingly; the positive shock to nontradables demand leads to a higher price level in the home country.==== Empirically, the seminal work of Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2004) made a careful assessment of this relationship and confirmed a positive (conditional) correlation between real exchange rates and net foreign assets.====In this paper, we re-visit the relationship with a new focus on external assets held by the public sector, i.e., international reserve accumulation. Before the 1990s, international reserves were less prominent, somewhat unconventional, and accumulated in size by only a handful of countries. Reserves, when compared to the overall external asset position for most countries, had not been significant. However, they have come to the forefront of international macroeconomic debates as reserve accumulation has been very rapid ever since, and they now comprise a large fraction of many countries’ external balance sheets. It has been a larger shift in emerging economies, but still noticeable in several advanced economies, such as Switzerland and Japan.==== After the Global Financial Crisis accumulation slowed, but reserves are still a significant component of external assets.====The central claim of our paper is that reserve accumulation matters for the debate over the international payments equilibrium at hand: it has a distinct role to play as a force driving the real exchange rate, but this force can be quite different than that of other international assets on the balance sheet. Our empirical work builds on Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2004) for 52 countries over the period 1980–2007, and we argue that it partly overturns the conventional wisdom with a different nuance.====We first confirm that the effect of private asset accumulation on the appreciation of the real exchange rate is positive, consistent with the older findings, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2002, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2004. However, we then show that the effect of reserve accumulation on the real exchange rate is, in general, exactly the opposite: there is a negative association with the appreciation of the real exchange rate. And, further, this effect varies with another policy instrument, capital controls. In our panel analysis for the period of 1980–2007, we find that when net foreign assets to GDP (net of reserves) increase by one percentage point, the real exchange rate appreciates by 0.15 percent. However, when reserves to GDP increase by one percentage point, the real exchange rate ==== by 0.63 percent. If we split our sample into two bins by the degree of financial openness, we find that our results vary even more. In financially open economies (low capital controls), real exchange rates depreciate by 0.20 percent when reserves to GDP increase by one percentage point. However, in financially closed economies (high capital controls), real exchange rates depreciate by a statistically significant 0.94 percent for the same reserve accumulation.====We find that the negative effect of reserve accumulation on the real exchange rate is varying over time, and heterogeneous between groups.==== If we focus on developing countries and the recent period of 1994–2007, our results become more pronounced. But the negative correlation is rarely observed or statistically insignificant in advanced countries. Furthermore, results hold when we address a potential identification issue. We employ an instrumental variable, proxying for exogenous changes in reserves, using commodity exports interacted with mandatory surrender requirements, which further supports our findings. Results also hold in an extended sample when alongside less industrialized countries we add oil exporters, these being major players in recent reserve accumulation. Even in an extended sample with a group of countries where real exchange rates are hardly market determined, the magnitude and the statistical significance of the negative association are mostly preserved. Our results also hold robustly for the period 1980–2015, and for a range of subsample choices.====We conclude that this is a new and robust stylized fact: the effect of reserves on the appreciation of the real exchange rate is broadly negative in general, and most prominent for samples containing high-reserve-accumulating countries (Emerging economies, including China) and periods (1994–2007, just before the Global Financial Crisis).====What could explain these results? A simple and intuitive theoretical rationale can account for these new empirical findings. The mechanism we propose builds on the model of Jeanne (2012). In a small-open endowment economy, we distinguish between tradable and nontradable goods. In this setup, the relative price level of one country, the real exchange rate, is proportional to the relative price of nontradable goods to tradable goods.==== As we will assume fixed endowments, the real exchange rate depends on tradable goods consumption which may vary intertemporally. If an economy has a positive private external wealth shock, then consumption of tradable goods and external assets will increase simultaneously to smooth out consumption. This will cause real exchange rate appreciation along with external asset increases, which is the prediction of the standard model. However, with a shock to public external saving—i.e., reserve accumulation—the prediction is overturned. Given the endowment of tradable goods, tradable consumption decreases as the public sector increases its external savings. Thus, the relative price of nontradable goods goes down as the relative marginal utility of tradable to nontradable goods consumption goes up. The real exchange rate will then depreciate, and the price level of the home country decreases, reversing the predictions of the standard model.====This mechanism further depends on a second key policy choice, capital controls. When capital control measures are imposed, frictions increase on desired international capital flows by private agents. Intertemporal reallocation now becomes harder, and so the positive responses of private assets to the appreciation of the real exchange rate becomes stronger with capital controls. More importantly, this means that capital controls break down Ricardian Equivalence and strengthen the effects of reserve accumulation. As external savings by the public sector increase (via reserve accumulation), private agents who perceive that wealth as their own assets would try to offset these outflows. Thus, controls on private agents’ borrowing are needed to effectively first, control external savings, and second control gross positions. These policy combinations in turn can derive from two deeper motives for reserve accumulation, the so-called ==== and ==== motives. We refer to the mix of policies as the “capital account policy” as in Jeanne (2012). It connects to real exchange rate determination, as the marginal effect of reserve accumulation on the real exchange rate varies with the degree of capital controls.====Further empirical support for validity of the rationale comes from evidence showing the association between capital account policies and the trade surplus. Our simple mechanics claim a tight association between the capital account policy and the real exchange rates, as the former controls the intertemporal allocation of the tradable goods. Thus, any attempts to intervene via capital account policy should be reflected in the trade accounts. A matching empirical result shows that; reserve accumulations in financially closed economies are associated with high trade surpluses; however, economies with low capital controls do not witness those. We argue that this is the direct matching evidence along with the real exchange rate determination. Again, the results only stand out during the period of heavy reserve accumulation, 1994–2007, and are more pronounced in emerging economies.====Given the rationale and the outcomes on real exchange rates and the trade account, one might argue what the reasons for the capital account policy are. As reserve accumulation came to the forefront of the economic debates, there were various rationales for the phenomenon. Roughly, it is possible to categorize those into two motives, so-called ==== and ==== motives. In the ==== motive (cf. Rodrik, 2008), one explains reserve accumulation as a means to promote export sectors and hence future economic growth. If exports generate a positive technology spillover, then this learning-by-doing externality on growth implies that reserve accumulation can be beneficial by expanding the export sector. However private agents cannot internalize the externality, so the government intervenes with capital account policies. On the other hand, there is a ==== motive (cf. Jeanne and Ranciere, 2011); a country accumulates reserves to have a buffer or an insurance to avert output or consumption losses in a “sudden stop” crisis. Thus, under the ==== motive, reserve accumulation and loosening capital controls lead to muted real exchange rates and trade surplus.====These debates naturally lead us to address the issue of capital account policy and its effect on economic growth. Countries with high reserve accumulation and relatively closed economies have typically witnessed real exchange rate undervaluation along with trade surpluses, so we examine whether the country indeed has had relatively high economic growth, as predicted in the ==== view. That is, whether the economies which had pursued the capital account policy indeed have had successful outcomes for economic growth. In our standard annual growth regression for the period 1988–2007, we show that one percentage point increases in lagged reserve accumulation to GDP are associated with 0.11 percent growth in real GDP per capita.==== Results hold in developing countries or in financially closed economies, but not in advanced economies or in financially open economies. We believe that these are the coherent results that the real undervaluation has been linked to the economic growth, and the capital account policy has been the instruments to achieve those.====Again, we stress that all our new empirical results are robust even if we address the potential identification issue. In the last section, we provide empirical results utilizing an instrumental variable. Reserve accumulations are endogenously determined, thus it is very hard to link our baseline correlation as a causal result. To solve the issue, we utilize an instrumental variable for the reserves recently proposed by Tong and Wei (2021) and do two-stage least squares regression analysis. We construct the predicted commodity exports revenue, and multiply those revenues with the indicator for mandatory surrender requirements. Thus reserves increases due to increases in commodity exports and the mandatory surrender requirements for the export proceeds will be regarded as identified reserve shocks. We expand the coverage of the instrumental variable to cover our sample of 52 countries from 1990 to 2015. Then we re-do all our empirical analysis with the IV. We find that our results utilizing these instrumented reserves are surprisingly consistent with the most of the baseline results. Thus our rationale in the theoretical predictions holds very robustly.====The novelty of our work comes from simplicity, which intuitively connects real exchange rates and external asset allocations. The mechanics and subsequent empirical facts are clear and mostly invulnerable to different explanations for reserves accumulation. We discuss in detail the optimal choice of capital account policy in the appendix. But our main empirical results certainly would not be bound to our explanation. We argue that these new and intuitive long-run correlations between external assets and real exchange rates are an essential feature of international payments equilibrium. Our empirical results build out from the previous wisdom in an intuitive way, adding nuance and a new stylized fact in international macroeconomics.====. Closing this introduction, we briefly relate our arguments to the existing literature. Most notably, the relationship between real exchange rates and net foreign assets is empirically documented in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2004), who confirm a positive association for the period 1975–1997. Controlling for relative GDP and the terms of trade, they find statistically significant results in line with the standard wealth effect. However, they do not distinguish external assets held by the official sector—reserve accumulation—nor do they take capital controls into account. We expand the sample up to 2007 (or to 2015 in our robustness checks), covering more of the recent high-accumulation period, and this allows us to find somewhat different forces at work.====Reserve accumulation in emerging markets has been large for the last couple of decades. Reserve accumulation used to be understood as a policy instrument for maintaining nominal exchange rate stability, or as a fund to cope with short-term payments difficulties. However as argued in Obstfeld et al. (2010), Jeanne and Ranciere (2011), and others, current levels of reserve accumulation seem too high to be rationalized by the old conventional wisdom. Furthermore, Gourinchas and Jeanne (2013) and Alfaro et al. (2014) argue that it is also related to the ==== (capital flows uphill, from poor to rich) and so-called global imbalances.====One strand of literature advocates the so-called ==== motive as a rationale for this large reserve accumulation. Dooley et al. (2004) and Korinek and Servén (2016) argue that emerging economies have been devaluing their currencies in order to facilitate their export sectors and growth, and that reserve accumulation is the policy instrument that they use to achieve an undervalued currency. Michaud and Rothert (2014) specifically focus on China and claim that, if a learning-by-doing externality is linked to the size of the manufacturing sector, then borrowing constraints matter for growth. Bergin et al., 2022a, Bergin et al., 2022b argue that the combination of reserves and capital controls reallocates production resources, and further is correlated with sectoral productivity growth.====On the other hand, a different strand of literature focused on crises and financial stability has emphasized the ==== motive for reserve accumulation. Jeanne and Ranciere (2011) provide a framework where reserve accumulation is in essence an insurance contract, approximated by a state-contingent contract with international investors.==== Obstfeld et al. (2010) propose a precautionary financial stability rationale based on the a “double drain” model under a peg.====Over a decade ago, Aizenman and Lee (2007) sought to empirically compare mercantilist and precautionary motives. They concluded that the precautionary motive was more supported by the evidence at that time. But it is fair to say that rationales may shift, and Ghosh et al. (2017) argue that the motives of emerging economies to increase reserves have varied over time.==== Recent research by Tong and Wei (2021) argues that reserve accumulation, which is presumed to reduce external vulnerability, indeed increases corporate leverage and aggravates the exposure of an individual firm to external shocks. They incorporate the predicted level of commodity exports and reserve surrender to identify exogenous reserve shocks, an approach we also employ in our analysis.====Even if these types of studies are successful in revealing the true motives behind reserve accumulation, they do not address the effect of the accumulation on real exchange rates.==== Our empirical work provides new stylized facts concerning external adjustment and real exchange rates. We argue that to account for how external assets affect the real exchange rate it is important to figure out whether the assets are held by the public sector or the private sector, and also to consider whether the real exchange rate could be misaligned due to externalities. With our new perspective and empirical findings, we address some of the gaps left by the previous literature.====We stress the role of gross external asset positions throughout our analysis. Several recent and contemporaneous papers also claim that this is important in understanding reserve accumulation. In these papers, increases in reserves can be understood as capital outflows by the government, the effects of which depend on the behavior of offsetting private capital inflows. These depend on capital controls, or other financial or institutional frictions. Bayoumi et al. (2015) empirically estimate the determinants of medium-term current accounts and find reserve accumulation and capital controls to be critical factors. Jeanne (2012) argues that nominal devaluation is not plausible especially in the long run. He instead claims that reserve accumulation combined with capital controls is an instrument to depreciate the ==== exchange rate in the Chinese economy. In a similar vein, Benigno et al. (2021) construct a quantitative model of real devaluation where reserve accumulation with imperfect capital mobility depreciates the real exchange rate and thus reallocates production inputs to the tradable sector, boosting growth. However, they abstract from the standard wealth effects.==== Finally, our work is related to the literature on capital account policies and economic growth. Rodrik (2008) argues that undervaluation of the currency stimulates economic growth. Our paper is consistent with that argument; the joint capital account policy choice, over reserve accumulation and capital controls, which is associated with a real exchange rate outcome, also maps into trade surplus and economic growth outcomes. We therefore also contribute to the discussion of whether financial account openness is related to economic growth, and by what channels. Kose et al. (2009a) argue that financial globalization leads to economic growth in developing countries, but with many nuances. In that same vein, we will conclude with the argument that—in our model and in reality—countries which have exploited a growth externality from the export sector, and which accumulated high reserves combined with less financial openness, did indeed attain higher GDP and TFP growth outcomes.====In the next section we present our model of real exchange rate determination. This provides a simple but convincing rationale for capital account policies and concurrent real exchange rate determination. Then, in Section 3, we lay out our empirical analysis: we explain our empirical specification of real exchange rate determination, show our results, and document the auxiliary evidence showing how capital account policies affect the trade balance and economic growth. We address causality concerns with an instrumental variable which captures exogenous changes in reserves in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.","Precaution versus mercantilism: Reserve accumulation, capital controls, and the real exchange rate",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000812,23 June 2022,2022,Research Article,76.0

We show that the desirability of macroprudential policies critically depends on the specific form of collateral used in debt contracts: While inefficiencies arise when current prices affect collateral—a frequent benchmark used to guide policies—they do not when only future prices affect collateral. Since the ==== and quantitative predictions of models with future-price collateral constraints do not appear less plausible than those using current prices, we conclude that additional empirical research on whether and how contract design is variant to policy is important for the use of these models in macroprudential policy design.","The last decade experienced a paradigm shift with respect to capital-control policies. Central policy institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, shifted towards an open approach to the implementation of capital controls, especially when these are aimed at preventing excessive borrowing and financial instability, also known as “macroprudential policies.” Currently, capital-control policies are part of the standard toolkit used by emerging-market policymakers worldwide.==== This is in sharp contrast to the conventional post-Bretton Woods opinion prior to the global financial crisis, which viewed these policies as impediments to the flow of capital to where it was most needed.====At the core of this paradigm change, there were significant advances in academic research in studying inefficient borrowing arising from financial frictions (e.g., Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis, 1986, Kehoe and Levine, 1993, Lorenzoni, 2008). Within this literature, an important building block has been the development of quantitative models that focus on collateral inefficiencies arising from prices that affect borrowing limits and individual agents not internalizing such price effects (Bianchi, 2011, Benigno et al., 2013, Bianchi and Mendoza, 2018).==== The main policy takeaway from these models is that governments can use state-contingent taxes on debt to improve the efficiency of decentralized competitive equilibria and reduce the occurrence and severity of credit crises.====Motivated by the surge of quantitative models aimed at being used in the design of macroprudential policies, in this paper, we ask how general the policy prescriptions from collateral-constraint models are.==== Starting from an incomplete-markets model with a general specification of collateral constraints, we show that the desirability of macroprudential policies critically depends on the specific form of collateral used in debt contracts: Whereas inefficiencies arise when current prices affect collateral, they do not when only future prices affect collateral. We also show that the microfoundations and quantitative predictions of collateral-constraint models linked to future prices do not appear less plausible than those using current prices. Our analysis implies that it is challenging to distinguish between these models and highlights the value of providing direct empirical evidence on the policy transmission featured in them.====The paper begins by laying out a canonical open economy model with tradable and nontradable goods and external borrowing subject to collateral constraints. We consider a general formulation of borrowing constraints (Farhi and Werning, 2016) that nests forms used frequently in the literature. One of these is borrowing linked to current income. As shown in Bianchi (2011), these economies generally feature inefficient borrowing. Another important form is borrowing linked to future income (similar to Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997 but with income instead of capital as collateral). In this case, we show that a policymaker with access to capital-control taxes that lacks commitment cannot improve welfare relative to the competitive-equilibrium allocation. Moreover, we show that this result also extends to open economies with collateral constraints linked to the value of income or capital that feature only future prices.====We then discuss the challenges of distinguishing between borrowing constraints with current or future income as collateral. We begin by discussing their theoretical microfoundations. On the one hand, collateral constraints that use future income emerge from a standard environment in which borrowers lack commitment to repay their debts akin to that studied by Eaton and Gersovitz (1981); lenders can seize a fraction of their income if borrowers default, and are only willing to offer risk-free debt contracts. On the other hand, collateral constraints that use current income require the assumption that borrowers can run away in the period in which they borrow (but not in the repayment period), and lenders can seize a fraction of their income in that state. From the perspective of microfoundations, it is therefore hard to rule out that future income is the main source of collateral in debt contracts.====We then study the quantitative properties of particular versions of both models—current and future income as collateral—and show that both predict similar aggregate dynamics. In particular, both models deliver business-cycle predictions aligned with the patterns observed in emerging market economies, including excess volatility of consumption over income, countercyclical trade balance, and “sudden stops.” In the model with current-income collateral, these properties emerge due to the Fisherian debt-deflation amplification mechanism, by which negative income shocks tighten collateral constraints, creating fire sales that lead to further consumption contractions (see Bianchi and Mendoza, 2020 for a survey of models that feature this mechanism). In the model with future-income collateral, these properties arise from exogenous shocks to the pledgeability of collateral or to the volatility of output, both of which are frequent sources of shocks in macro models.==== The similarity of these models’ predictions implies that it is hard to distinguish them without direct empirical evidence of the borrowing constraint's specific form.====Finally, we stress that the absence of macroprudential policies in models with future income as collateral extends to an environment in which the government can commit to its future policies. In this case, although the competitive equilibrium is no longer efficient, the government does not find it optimal to tax household borrowing prior to a crisis. Instead, the optimal policy features a “forward-guidance” component once the crisis hits, which involves promised debt subsidies during the recovery.====Related to our work, a set of papers have analyzed how predictions of collateral-constraint models vary with different timing assumptions. This includes the recent work by Katagiri et al., 2017, Devereux et al., 2019 and Dong et al. (2020). Our contribution to this body of work is twofold. First, we show that a generalized efficiency property arises whenever current income does not affect collateral. Second, we argue that models with current or future income as collateral are hard to distinguish based on their microfoundations and quantitative predictions.====It is worth highlighting that our analysis focuses on inefficiencies that arise from prices affecting collateral constraints and abstracts from three types of borrowing inefficiencies that have also been analyzed in the literature. First, by focusing on a representative-agent small-open-economy model with segmented markets (capital priced by households and debt priced by foreign investors), we abstract from distributive externalities that arise from incomplete asset markets (see, for example, Lorenzoni, 2008). Dávila and Korinek (2018) analyze the distinction between collateral and distributive externalities and their relationship with fire sales and financial amplification. Second, by focusing on real economies, we abstract from inefficiencies that arise from nominal rigidities (see, for example, Farhi and Werning, 2016, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2016). Third, our paper abstracts from the use of policy tools to solve inefficiencies from coordinating failures (see, for example, Gertler et al., 2020, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2021).",Are collateral-constraint models ready for macroprudential policy design?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000824,23 June 2022,2022,Research Article,77.0

Using difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods, this paper examines the effects of this shift on trade flows. Exploiting variation in the timing of adoption of the new technology by different producers to identify the causal effects of 3D printing, the analysis finds that exports of hearing aids increased by roughly 80% following the introduction of the new technology. There is no evidence of a localization effect, as overall trade in hearing aids expanded by a similar amount. As a robustness check, the paper examines 35 products that are partially 3D printed and finds positive and significant effects on trade. These effects are stronger for more complex and lighter goods. The results counter widespread views that 3D printing will shorten supply chains and reduce trade.","Will 3D printing disrupt world trade? The new technology has been accompanied by predictions of a future where goods will be printed locally, global supply chains will be shortened, and international trade will be dramatically reduced. Firms (and perhaps even consumers) will be able to create a solid three-dimensional object from a digital file and will no longer need to import printable goods and components. One study finds that as much as 40% of trade could be eliminated by 2040.====In contrast, many earlier improvements in production processes that reduced production costs and/or improved quality boosted international trade. The industrial revolution is perhaps the best example, where a transformation in technology and management practices brought huge productivity gains, output growth, and expanded trade. The impact of 3D printing technology on world trade is therefore an empirical question.====Early evidence suggests that firms (and countries) will continue to specialize and 3D printing will stimulate trade growth. While 3D printing allows product customization, it does not beat traditional manufacturing technologies for bulk production of simple items. Even for the specialized products where it is most effective, it is not leading to decentralized production. One example comes from dentistry, where custom products are in high demand but are being manufactured and exported by high-tech firms. Consider Renishaw, a British engineering company, that makes dental crowns and bridges from digital scans of patients' teeth. The printers run for 8–10 h to make custom teeth from cobalt-chrome alloy powder, which are then shipped to dental labs in continental Europe, where a layer of porcelain is added before the teeth are finally exported to dentists.==== Because the production process remains complex, dentists are not installing the machines to print teeth locally. The production process changed but the supply chain remains intact.====In addition to teeth, the innovative technology is also being used for several other goods, from running shoes to prosthetic limbs. The good where 3D printing is most common is hearing aids. Nearly 100% of all hearing aids consumed in the world are produced using 3D printing (Banker, 2013; Wohlers Associates, 2015).==== 3D printers transformed the hearing aid industry in a short period of time in the mid-2000s, which makes this product a unique natural experiment to assess the trade effects of this technology. We use the example of hearing aids to examine the effects of 3D printing on international trade and to study how trade patterns have changed as production technologies shifted. Beyond this specific example, we also investigate trade in other goods where the use of 3D printing is expanding.====We examine the data in three ways. First, we investigate how trade in hearing aids changed over the period when 3D printing was being adopted. The results show an expansion in overall trade in hearing aids compared with similar goods. Moreover, countries where producers adopted the new technology experienced faster growth in hearing aid exports than in other similar products; and faster growth in hearing aid exports than countries to which the technology had not spread. Second, to estimate the causal effects of the technology, we use a dynamic version of a standard differences-in-differences event study technique. We exploit the differential timing of adoption of the new technology across producers and study how hearing aid exports adjusted, compared with otherwise similar products, controlling for exporter-product, product-year effects, and exporter-year effects. Third, we use synthetic controls to address possible pre-trends in the hearing aid trade data. Both sets of empirical results show that the shift to 3D printing led to a doubling or near doubling in producers' exports after five years.====Taken together, the results point to a causal, positive aggregate effect of 3D printing on trade. The results comparing aggregate hearing aid exports with exports of otherwise similar goods show that hearing aid exports expanded relatively more rapidly, implying there was no major shift to domestic production when the technology was adopted. The results exploiting variation in timing of technological adoption across countries, controlling for demand and supply shocks, show that 3D printing was the main cause for the rise in exports. While 3D printing could have spread across countries to small firms or doctors close to the final consumer, thus shortening supply chains, evidence implies that the potential production localization effect was swamped by the stimulative effect of 3D printing on large-scale manufacturing and trade.====The intuition for the stimulative effect on trade is that 3D printing reduced the cost of production and enhanced the quality of the product. Demand rose and exports expanded. One reason for the strong positive effect on trade is that hearing aids are light products which makes them relatively cheap to transport internationally (we come back to this point below). A second reason is because printing hearing aids in high volumes requires a large investment in technology and machinery and the presence of highly specialized inputs and services. The companies from Denmark and Switzerland that were early innovators remain prominent in the industry. Some middle-income economies such as China, Mexico, and Vietnam have also been able to substantially increase their market shares between 1995 and 2015, through the existing and new subsidiaries from the large companies. Following the introduction of 3D printing, total worldwide production became more concentrated in the top companies: The largest six manufacturers accounted for 98% in 2012 up from 92% in 2005. Despite the increase in firm concentration, exports did not become more concentrated in the top producing countries: The largest six producers accounted for 75% of exports in 2012 down from 80% in 2005, as exports expanded relatively more rapidly in low-cost producers.====While the effect of 3D printing on hearing aids is robust, it is also very specific. To investigate whether the insights from trade in hearing aids may be more general, we examine 35 other products that are increasingly being 3D printed and find similar patterns. These budding 3D products have also experienced faster trade growth than otherwise similar goods. Finally, we investigate the extent to which two product characteristics impact the effect on trade: complexity and weight. More complex products may be less likely to be printed domestically because technology diffusion is more costly and/or intellectual property rights prevent diffusion. Lighter products may be less likely to be printed domestically because trade costs are minimal. Indeed, we find that the positive effect of 3D printing on trade increases with product complexity and decreases with product weight.====This paper contributes to the literature on how new technologies affect international trade. Despite discussion in the specialized press,==== to our knowledge this is the first paper that empirically investigates the impact of 3D printing on trade. Goldfarb and Tucker (2019) have a recent survey of the literature on digital economics, which does not review any paper on 3D printing.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes 3D printing in hearing aids. Section 3 describes how economic theory suggests 3D printing will affect trade. Section 4 studies the impact of 3D printing on international trade in hearing aids using differences-in-differences methodology and synthetic controls.

Using a quantitative multi-country, multi-sector trade model, we disentangle two important layers of complexity: First, European integration is governed by various, partly overlapping arrangements — the ","Europe is the world region that has experienced the deepest degree of economic integration since World War II. The Customs Union was completed in 1968, the European Single Market was established in 1993, the Schengen Agreement that ended formal border controls between many European countries entered into force in 1995, and the Eurozone was created in 1999. From the early 1990s onwards, the Union expanded from 12 to 28 members in the course of two decades. However, the resulting network is complex as not all EU members are part of all agreements and EU outsiders participate in some of them. Other regional integration schemes such as in South America or in the ASEAN region, also feature overlapping arrangements, but these are less differentiated and the depth of integration is much weaker; see Duer et al. (2014). Moreover, only the EU applies fiscal transfers between member states.====Most of the existing literature on the quantitative effects of European integration ignores this institutional complexity. In this paper, we decompose the economic costs of undoing Europe with the help of a modern quantitative trade model that also accounts for a second source of complexity: the production networks that have emerged over time between countries and sectors.====We strongly anchor our analysis in a comprehensive econometric ==== evaluation of the various steps of European integration – the EU Customs Union, the Single Market, the Common Currency, the Schengen Agreement, and the network of regional trade agreements (RTA) with third parties – using the sector-level gravity equations that our theoretical general equilibrium model implies. To identify treatment effects, we exploit the panel nature of our data. Given the theoretical model, these estimates can be translated into changes in ==== tariff equivalents of non-tariff trade costs.====In a second step, we use these estimates to inform our counterfactual analysis. More specifically, we simulate the economic consequences of “undoing Europe”, highlighting country-level and sector-level heterogeneity regarding output, trade, and welfare effects, and contrasting models with and without complex IO linkages. We bootstrap the distribution of structurally estimated parameters and the corresponding simulated effects to obtain confidence intervals for our model predictions. Our bootstrap methodology provides a convenient solution to deal with estimated structural parameters that are not individually significant or need to satisfy theoretical constraints. Moreover, the bootstrap methodology permits us to test for the statistical significance of our comparative static results.====In our preferred gravity model, we estimate that membership in the Single Market boosts goods trade by about 46%, which corresponds to an average reduction of non-tariff trade costs of about 13 percentage points (pp), given the estimated trade elasticity. In services trade, the trade creation effects is as high as 64%, corresponding to a 28pp trade cost saving, probably reflecting the reduction in trade policy uncertainty along with lower explicit trade barriers. Membership in the Eurozone yields trade cost savings of about 3pp in goods and of about 10pp in services trade. The evaluation of the Schengen Agreement is more involved; how bilateral trade costs between two countries ==== and ==== are affected depends on whether the transit countries between ==== and ==== are Schengen members. Accounting for this complication, we find that abolishing border controls between neighbors reduces trade costs by 11pp for goods and by 5pp for services. Across sectors, we detect a large degree of heterogeneity.====In our counterfactual analysis, based on the baseline year of 2014, we find that a complete elimination of all European integration steps would lower trade within the EU by some 25%. Intra-EU production networks would unravel: The domestic value added content in exports would go up by 3 to 5pp as sourcing of inputs from foreign sources falls by more than overall trade. Due to substitution effects, trade with third parties may go up, but this effect is dampened and – in some cases reversed – by negative income effects. Moreover, third country effects are small and mostly not statistically significant.====In scenarios that involve a more partial breakdown of the EU, i.e., a breakdown of individual agreements, trade effects are much smaller. Overall, output losses are substantially more important for new EU members than for old ones and value added contracts less than output in EU countries.==== A complete breakdown of the EU would generate statistically significant real consumption losses for all EU members. Smaller countries such as Malta, Luxembourg, or Estonia would lose 19%, 18%, and 12% respectively; larger countries such as Germany, France or Italy would lose 5%, 4%, and 4%, respectively. The least exposed EU country is the UK (pre-Brexit; −3%). Reintroducing tariffs equal to current EU most-favored nations (MFN) tariffs could have positive (albeit tiny) effects on real consumption in several countries, such as Cyprus or Greece. Overall, Single Market effects dominate strongly. Moreover, we find that eliminating transfer payments among EU countries leads to adverse terms of trade adjustments for net beneficiaries from the transfer system, and vice versa for net contributors. Hence, our model sides with Keynes in the famous Keynes-Ohlin debate on the welfare effects of transfer payments.====We also study the effects of an EU breakdown in simpler versions of our model in order to understand the importance of accounting for sectoral detail and for intersectoral IO linkages. We find that both dimensions of complexity are quantitatively important. Both, the less complex model variant featuring only three aggregate sectors (compared to the 50 sectors in our main model) and the variant without intersectoral production linkages predict substantially smaller real consumption losses. Moreover, the simple model without intersectoral linkages fails to capture the impact of the trade cost increases on upstream services sectors producing inputs for the trade-exposed manufacturing sector, predicting a much bigger decline in manufacturing, in absolute and in relative terms. For example, new (old) EU countries lose 1.4pp (0.9pp) in the share of manufacturing value added in total value added compared to losses of 0.6pp (0.4pp) in the model with complex IO linkages. We show that these differences are in many cases statistically significant. Hence, accounting for sectoral detail and intersectoral linkages is crucial for the quantification of the welfare effects of EU integration.====Our paper is related to several strands of the literature. First, a large empirical literature estimates the trade effects of integration policies using gravity models; see Head and Mayer (2014) for an overview. The European currency union has received special attention, but the earlier literature has been inconclusive; cf. Micco et al. (2003), Baldwin and Taglioni (2007), Berger and Nitsch (2008), or Bergin and Lin (2012). There has been substantially more consensus on the effects of goods market integration; cf. Baier and Bergstrand (2007), Egger and Larch (2011), or Bergstrand et al. (2015). In contrast, very few studies exist on the trade effects of the Schengen Agreement. It is important to acknowledge that, unlike bilateral agreements, Schengen has a spatial dimension. Land-borne trade flows within Europe may cross one border (e.g., France–Spain) or up to eight internal borders (e.g., Portugal–Finland). Hence, Schengen membership treats country pairs heterogeneously, depending on the number of internal Schengen borders to be crossed. This feature is ignored in the small existing literature, which treats Schengen analogously to trade agreements and currency unions, cf. Davis and Gift (2014) or Chen and Novy (2011).====We also relate to a large literature on trade policy analysis in computational general equilibrium (CGE) models. See Whalley and Shoven (1984) and Francois and Kenneth (1998) for excellent methodological contributions and Checchini et al. (1988) for a famous ex-ante analysis related to Europe. Following criticism by Kehoe (2005), quantitative trade modeling has made substantial progress; Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) and Ottaviano (2014) provide surveys, and Kehoe et al. (2017) a critical discussion. This new incarnation of an old literature builds on a tight integration of estimation and calibration. Many papers have employed such techniques; one particularly noteworthy is the one by Corcos et al. (2012). Specifically, we build on the model proposed by Caliendo and Parro (2015) which is a multi-sector version of the multi-country, multi-goods stochastic technology Ricardian trade model of Eaton and Kortum (2002).==== Importantly, this model accounts for the rich network of intra- and international IO linkages that characterize trade in goods and services in Europe.====Mayer et al. (2019) is the paper most closely related to ours. However, we go beyond their work by offering five main contributions: (i) we obtain the key model parameters – policy estimates of the different EU integration agreements – for our simulation exercises from a structural gravity model that relies on exactly the same base data (same set of countries, sectoral decomposition and time period) as the simulation exercise; (ii) the scenario definitions of collapsing the various EU integration agreements are based on the economic analysis of those data, as we calculate trade cost changes in non-tariff barriers from our structural gravity estimates; (iii) our model features multiple sectors and an IO structure that facilitates matching international IO linkages at the most detailed level at which data are available; (iv) we make use of bootstrapping methods to quantify parameter uncertainty of our simulation exercise and thus provide confidence intervals for our predictions. We show that accounting for sectoral detail and complex intersectoral IO relationships is important: Welfare losses are underestimated by up to 6pp without intersectoral IO linkages. Our bootstrap exercise shows that the differences between predictions obtained by the models with and without these linkages are statistically significant. And finally, (v) our model features tariff income and income transfers. The latter permits us to include the effects of ending within-EU transfer payments.====Our paper focuses in maximum detail on two of the four dimensions of European integration: goods and services trade. We do not account for the integration of labor and capital markets. Our analysis, therefore, captures only a part of the welfare effects that the European project has spawned. Caliendo et al. (2021) provide a first paper that captures both, trade and labor market integration in a quantitative model. It focuses on the Eastern Enlargement of the EU and studies the interaction between lower costs of trade and labor mobility. However, it does not feature the institutional complexity that we account for; it has no sectoral detail and does not model production networks. It would be a promising step forward to embed our framework into a quantitative spatial model with trade and migration alike the ones developed by Caliendo et al. (2019) and Monte et al. (2018).====As regards the effects of capital market integration in Europe, Bruno et al. (2021) provide empirical gravity estimates for FDI originating within and outside the EU. Neary (2002) discusses several mechanisms through which EU trade integration shapes the incentives for FDI. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no quantitative evidence on the joint effects of the four freedoms. We view the development of a quantitative framework that facilitates such an analysis as a milestone for future research.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the model. Section 3 contains a sectoral ex-post evaluation of EU integration steps. Section 4 discusses the main quantitative results. Section 5 highlights the role of sectoral heterogeneity and complex IO structures for our results.

Our model indicates that countries should set systematically lower preferential margins when the bloc takes the form of a ==== area, relative to a customs union. Moreover, in customs unions (but not necessarily in free trade areas) preferential margins should increase with the supply of partner countries and decrease with the level of preferential imports. These relationships reflect, respectively, the internalization of political-economy goals within the bloc and the desire to curb trade diversion. Using a sample that covers most PTAs formed by Latin American countries in the 1990s, we find empirical support for each of those predictions. These findings rationalize why governments often keep intra-bloc duties strictly positive. We show that this tends to worsen the welfare consequences of PTAs, and that requiring the elimination of internal tariffs would be socially desirable.","The history of trade policy in the last thirty years has been, to a large extent, the history of the growth of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). Currently, the 164 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have on average about twenty PTA partners, whereas that figure was around five in 1994, when the Uruguay Round—the last finished round of multilateral talks—was concluded.==== There are also several additional agreements currently under negotiation and in the ratification stage.====In tandem with the increasing prominence of PTAs and their theoretically ambiguous welfare implications—since they yield both lower trade barriers and more discriminatory trade policies—there have been numerous analyses of their causes and consequences. The goal of several theoretical and empirical studies has been to understand how members choose their external tariffs once they form a trading bloc. That is a key issue because, for given intra-bloc tariffs, higher external tariffs tend to be associated with more inefficiency and lower global welfare, since they imply both higher trade barriers and more trade discrimination.====Strikingly, empirical and theoretical analyses of intra-bloc (“internal”) PTA tariffs and of preferential margins are rare. That is surprising. After all, although PTAs increasingly encompass different policy dimensions, the single policy that is associated with ==== existing PTAs is the reduction of internal tariffs.==== A likely explanation for the scarcity of research on the topic is a common presumption that internal tariffs are either zero or very close to zero. That presumption has an institutional foundation, since Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which provides the underpinnings under which members of the WTO can form PTAs, requires that “the duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce [should be] eliminated on substantially all the trade between the constituent territories in products originating in such territories” (====). There are three important caveats to Article XXIV, however. First, its language is vague, as it does not provide a criterion for the definition of “substantially all the trade.”==== Second, the enforcement power of Article XXIV is questionable (the WTO has never ruled that an existing PTA should be reversed). Third, PTAs among developing countries can be notified to the WTO under the ====, which does not impose such constraints. That is the case with the majority of the agreements in our dataset. And indeed, intra-bloc tariffs are very often nonzero, and there is substantial variation across countries, sectors and time.====In this paper, we start to fill that gap in the literature. First, we develop a political-economy model to discipline the empirical analysis and rationalize its results. The model shows how countries in different types of trading blocs choose their internal tariffs and preferential margins and highlights the factors that shape them. Then, using a dataset that encompasses most preferential trade agreements formed in South America during the 1990s, plus those formed by Mexico, we evaluate the model's predictions empirically.====A central element of our analysis is the institutional design of a PTA—i.e., whether it is organized as a customs unions (CU) or as a free trade area (FTA). The main institutional difference between CUs and FTAs is that, under the former, members coordinate their external trade policies, typically choosing a common external tariff for each good. In contrast, in FTAs members are free to set their external tariffs as they wish. This matters, because the level of external tariffs directly affects the degree of preferential access that each member receives, and hence it also determines the members’ extent of gains in each other's markets. Naturally, then, several authors have studied how CUs and FTAs differ in terms of their external trade policies. In contrast, we compare, for the first time, how the two types of PTAs differ in terms of their ==== trade policies, the missing piece of information needed to fully assess the preferential margins offered by each type of bloc.====We show that, under sufficiently strong tariff complementarity,==== preferential margins should be systematically higher in CUs than in FTAs. The intuition is simple. Because of tariff complementarity, members of FTAs have an incentive to lower their external tariffs after forming the bloc. That, however, hurts the exporters of the partners, whose margin of preference decreases. Anticipating that, FTA members choose to keep intra-bloc tariffs relatively high, to moderate each other's incentives to subsequently lower external tariffs. This keeps preferential margins in FTAs relatively low. In contrast, such caution in lowering intra-bloc duties is unnecessary in CUs, where members negotiate both internal and external tariffs. As a result, CU members are willing to set intra-bloc tariffs relatively low, knowing that the ensuing preferential margins will not be eroded by subsequent unilateral changes in external tariffs. This yields relatively high preferential margins in CUs.====Our model generates additional predictions. First, preferential margins in CUs should increase with the supply in partner countries, as political-economy objectives in partner countries are internalized. The implication is that industries that are larger within the bloc will enjoy greater preferential treatment. This echoes the result of Grossman and Helpman (1994) that industries that produce larger volumes tend to enjoy greater political clout and, hence, be more protected in a country, except that here the mechanism is applied to preferential access in CUs. That result does not extend automatically to FTAs, however, because in FTAs there is a countervailing force due to the indirect impact of the internal tariffs on the external tariffs. Second, preferential margins in CUs should decrease with the level of intra-bloc imports, to limit the extent of trade diversion. Again, that result does not extend to FTAs. Since members anticipate that external tariffs fall along with internal tariffs in FTAs, concerns with growing trade diversion as the latter fall are not as pressing.====More generally, we show that, in CUs, external tariffs and preferential margins serve distinct purposes. The external tariff tackles domestic political-economy issues and tariff-induced distortions—exactly what the nondiscriminatory, most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff does in the absence of trade agreements. Those issues (and thus the associated tariff determinants) are defined solely by the importing country-related variables. In turn, the preferential margin addresses the issues created by the formation of the bloc: political-economy issues from the partner countries and distortions due to trade diversion. Those aspects are defined at the bilateral level, bringing an additional dimension into the analysis of tariff determinants after the formation of a trading bloc. By contrast, because in FTAs internal tariffs (endogenously) affect external ones, there is no clear-cut separation between policy instruments and policy targets.====To evaluate those predictions empirically, we study the tariff structure of ten Latin American countries from 1990 to 2001. This period is particularly appropriate for our analysis, as it marks the onset of several bilateral trade relationships in the region. Most agreements are in the form of FTAs, but Mercosur and CAN, initially formed as FTAs, became CUs in 1995. This institutional change is central for our identification. It is also helpful that we consider mostly agreements that involve only developing economies, because the aforementioned constraints due to GATT's Article XXIV are less likely to matter for them. While much of our data is relatively easy to access, data on preferential rates are much less available. For that information, we rely on the data first used by Estevadeordal et al. (2008).====We use a wide set of fixed effects to control for potential unobserved confounding factors. To deal with the endogeneity of the preferential imports, which may be affected by preferential margins, we use either the pre-bloc import levels or an instrumental variable approach. Following the rationale first used by Autor et al. (2013), our main instrument is the partner's exports to the rest of the world (i.e., excluding the PTA importing country) at the industry level.==== To deal with the endogeneity of the supply of partner countries, which may be affected by preferential margins as well, we use the average output of the three countries in the sample whose output is most correlated with the output of the PTA partner, but which are ==== themselves PTA partners of the importing country. We confirm that the instruments are strong. Moreover, according to our model, they do not have an independent, direct effect on intra-bloc tariffs or preferential margins, and should therefore satisfy the exclusion restrictions. Empirically, we confirm that on average the three country-industry-year triplets defined in the instruments account for just about 5 percent of the importing country's imports in that industry-year.====We find empirical support for all the theoretical predictions of the model. The results reveal that the tariff-setting process is very different in CUs and FTAs, resulting in preferential margins that differ in levels and that respond to economic conditions differently. We confirm those results also by implementing a falsification exercise whereby we split our sample into two periods, the FTA period (1990–1994) and the CU period (1995–2001), and include a “fake” CU dummy, equal to one when the importer and exporter are Mercosur or CAN members during the FTA period. None of the predictions holds for this placebo exercise.====It is important to stress that the differences in tariff structures that we observe for the two types of agreements reflect not only different incentives when setting external tariffs (for which the processes differ by design), but also the internal tariffs (for which the formal process is the same, but the outcome is endogenously different). This highlights the need to model the latter explicitly, rather than simply assuming that they will drop to zero.====Our analysis helps to understand the welfare implications of trading blocs, which depend directly on both the level of intra-bloc and external tariffs, and the difference between them. In doing so, the analysis provides a rationalization of GATT Article XXIV's constraint on intra-bloc duties. Because of their political-economy motivations, if allowed, PTA members will generally choose strictly positive intra-bloc tariffs. This tends to lower welfare in the bloc—exactly what happens with CUs in our model. If Article XXIV were enforced, however, such a conclusion would no longer be warranted and CUs could become welfare improving. The welfare gain due to enforcing Article XXIV can be even higher for FTAs, if the constraint induces a greater reduction of external tariffs there. Thus, our analysis indicates that PTAs would tend to be more beneficial if Article XXIV's constraint on internal tariffs were enforced.====The paper is organized as follows. We discuss below the related literature. In Section2 we develop a political-economy model to guide our Empirical analysis. In Sections 3 and 4 we describe, respectively, our data and our empirical strategy. In Section5 we present and discuss the empirical results.

Without a doubt, the human factor, in the form of managerial know-how, has proved to play a central role in explaining this empirical regularity: The argument being that catering products to an international customer base entails a learning process, which, to a large degree, stems from the experience of doing it, and as such is often tacit and informal in nature and is intimately connected to managers’ experiences and background.==== Therefore, different employers immensely contend for managers’ highly valuable export experience. As managers come to be the target of other companies’ head-hunting activity, they become highly mobile, thus having a notable impact on possibly multiple firms’ internationalization.====However, establishing empirically managers’ mobility and export experience as export-conducive has been impaired in the international field of economics by the paucity of quasi–experimental evidence and the consequent eternal quest for suitable instrumental variables.==== The paper's aim is to approach causality with a novel identification strategy, based on a control function approach resting on economic theory grounded in the ==== literature. Our focus here is on the centrality of managerial mobility, yet this methodology has a wider scope, as it is applicable, for instance, also to the literature on ====, where similar empirical limitations are encountered. In the second place, our aim is to deepen our knowledge about the key attributes of managers’ fund of ====, matured along their career, that increase the presence of poaching firms on international markets.====In a nutshell, the empirical conundrum in establishing causality is that firms that are both exporting and poaching are hardly a random selection of the population of firms, nor is their selection of managers. In such a context, firms’ performances on international markets driven by inward mobility of managers is confounded with differences in firms’ unobserved characteristics (i.e., ====). Above all, differences in firms’ innate capacity of exerting a pull on movers clearly determine unequal chances of poaching and hinder the estimation of a causal effect. Precisely to learn about the ==== ascribable to the hiring firm and captivating ====’ attention on the labor market, our approach relies on the consolidated theory of Burdett and Mortensen (1998). The reason being that their modeling of job-to-job transitions enables us to determine the propensity with which a firm is able to hire the sought expertise as a function of its own innate characteristics and for reasons other than firms’ internationalization. Specifically, the theory accomplishes a dual-purpose: it provides the necessary foundation to derive a control function for the selection into hiring and suggests exploitable variation in the data to identify the ==== attracting movers into poaching firms. Exploiting then a rich data set entailing economy-wide mobility patterns over a decade, we uncover that the distribution of firms’ matching ability - the approximated one based on our control function - varies to a significant degree with treatment status (i.e., ====), more markedly so in the tail of the distribution. This, in turn, implies plausible strong mean–differences between hiring and non-hiring firms relative to their truly unobserved matching ability, which is at the root of ==== inflows of managers. To obviate this problem, the theory actually justifies purging the treatment of its endogenous component by proxing firm's unobserved matching ability with the estimated ==== obtainable from our control function and expressing firm's approximated propensity of ====. Furthermore, we provide corroborative evidence in support of our proxy by showing that it correlates in theoretically consistent ways with a number of observable determinants of the firm's recruiting propensity deducible from the theory.====Although being computationally and data intensive in estimating the ====, our approach has a number of practical advantages. The most important ones are its micro-foundation jointly with the ease of implementation, just requiring the outcome equation in the final step to be augmented with the “appropriate” correction term for self-selected job-to-job flows. Finally, our setting retains the possibility of using a large battery of fixed effects. We can show convincingly indeed that firm-market fixed effects alone can come a long way and play a critical role in the correction of the endogeneity bias. Nevertheless, even in our most demanding specification, which controls for the widest battery of fixed effects and includes firm-time fixed effects, we find a positive endogeneity bias of about 20% when neglecting selection into hiring as captured by the estimated propensity of ====.====Our analysis confirms the general lesson that managers’ specific market experience matters for firms’ internationalization, especially when resulting from longer tenures. But it also shows that knowledge accumulated on the job is at least as important for internationalization as “personal” knowledge related to the ==== (e.g., country of origin). Finally, we conclude that such knowledge is eventually complemented by managers’ personal contacts and sales networks from the previous job.====Topic-wise, our paper is in the same spirit of Labanca et al. (2014), Masso et al. (2015), and Mion et al. (2017) and strives to deepen our knowledge of the internationalization of firms. Methodologically, however, it departs from the IV approach in favor of a control-function approach grounded in theory. Relying on a control function is certainly not new to international economics: recently, Helpman et al. (2017) resort to it to highlight the selection of firms as a new channel through which trade shapes wage inequality. Besides the obvious difference in the variable of interest, there are other methodological differences. Their labor market with ==== follows the tradition of the ==== model, whereas our labor market in the wake of Burdett and Mortensen (1998) allows for ==== search. Moreover, their outcome and selection equations - in reduced form - stem from the same underlying theoretical model, whereas we take the outcome equation directly from the literature we want to contribute to and add to it the control function, which the theory suggests to be necessary to correct for self-selected mobility. In this sense, our approach is more similar to the one followed in Dahl (2002): like the Roy model in his approach, which allows factoring in self-selected migration in the estimation of the return to college, the Burdett and Mortensen (1998) model adopted here enables appropriately correcting the estimates of the firm “return” to ==== acquisition in the presence of self-selected job-to-job flows.====Our work intersects the trade and network literature, which has emphasized that immigrants are a prominent driver of firm internationalization because of their deep knowledge of their country of origin (Blonigen and Wooster, 2003; Hiller, 2013; Ottaviano et al., 2018). In this literature the specificity of their knowledge derives from personal attributes (i.e., their nationality), while our focus is on knowledge that has been acquired throughout managers’ work career on the local labor market.====Obviously, our article relates to other strands of the economic literature.==== In particular, it connects to the literature on managerial practices, sharing with Bloom et al. (2016) the view that management is akin to a technology when it comes to firm performance. Moreover, it borrows its core model from the labor literature and contribute to it by emphasizing that the reallocation of workers across firms is beneficial also to the performance of firms on international markets and by pointing out the criticality of selected mobility flows (Friedrich, 2016).====The structure of our paper is as follows. Section 2 presents our empirical strategy and the Burdett and Mortensen (1998) model, which sits at the core of our identification strategy. Section 3 briefly describes the data and presents the relevant descriptive statistics. In Section 4, we present evidence for the validity of our control function approach, while in Section 5 we present our results on “how” managers affect firms’ international performance. Section 6 evaluates the key attributes of managers’ knowledge, the “what” managers know that shapes the internationalization process. Section 7 briefly focuses on the effects of this type of knowledge on the intensive margin of trade.

Can we take the strategic default model, developed for emerging markets, and recalibrate it to explain the crisis in Greece? The Greek economy differs from an emerging market in having higher government debt relative to GDP, counter-cyclical government debt, and consumption smoother than income. Our recalibrated strategic default model matches the high debt/GDP, but it misses the other two features of advanced countries. And it fails to generate a crisis. We propose an alternative model, replacing the absence of commitment to repay with commitment. Default occurs due to inability to repay and is excusable. Our alternative model of excusable default allows us to match the behavior of debt and the spread as the crisis approaches, as well as key features of business cycles in advanced countries. It also generates a crisis with correct timing.","The sovereign debt crisis in Greece revealed that sovereign default is not limited to emerging and developing countries. Additionally, rising debt/GDP in many countries in the wake of the global pandemic raises the question of which advanced countries could succumb next to a debt crisis. The strategic default model was developed to explain business cycle moments and debt crises for emerging economies - historically, the crisis countries. Can we take the canonical strategic default model, as presented in Arellano (2008), calibrate it for an advanced economy like Greece, and use it to explain the Greek experience? And by extension, can we use it to assess the probability of future crises in advanced countries which are currently accumulating large quantities of debt? We show that the strategic default model has trouble matching key features of the data leading up to the Greek crisis and offer an alternative model.====Fig. 1 illustrates the behavior of GDP, consumption, public debt, and the interest rate spread in the period leading up to the Greek crisis. We cut the data after 2010Q1 due to official intervention beginning in 2010Q2. We want a model consistent with this behavior. Output is below the mean for almost the entire period and takes a sharp downward plunge beginning with the world-wide financial crisis. The behavior of consumption roughly follows that of output, but is less volatile. In the beginning of the sample, output is below the mean and debt relative to trend GDP is high, at a little over one hundred percent of GDP and appears counter-cyclical. After output begins to fall, debt rises and later spikes once output falls dramatically. Interest rate spreads remain low until they spike, first with a sharp fall in output in 2009Q1 and second, with another large fall in output, just prior to the first bailout in 2010Q2.====We view 2010Q1 as the crisis date. Although Greece did not have scheduled debt repayments due in 2010Q1, Greece sought external help and began austerity programs, indicating financial stress. Greece received its first bailout in 2010Q2, and this bailout was likely responsible for postponing the actual default. Therefore, we argue that the first period in which Greece faced financing difficulties, which could have created default if Greece had had debt due and not received official assistance, was 2010Q1.====We want a model consistent with the dynamics prior to the Greek crisis. These include consumption less volatile than income, counter-cyclical government debt, a rising path of debt leading up to the crisis date, and a crisis in 2010Q1, accompanied by a spike in debt and the spread. We entertain a modification of the canonical strategic default model (Arellano, 2008), in which the optimizing sovereign is not committed to repay debt and chooses default whenever the cost of default, loss of output and financial market exclusion, exceeds the benefits of default, given by debt reduction. The modification (Yue, 2010) allows for repayments in default due to renegotiation. We also consider an excusable default model (Grossman and Van Huyck, 1988) with limits on ability to pay, in which the sovereign makes optimizing decisions on consumption and debt subject to the commitment that she always pays up to her ability. Any default is “excusable” since she is unable to pay more, and therefore elicits no punishment.====Our calibrations of both models yield dynamics consistent with data for excusable default, but not for strategic default. To understand which components of each model make one succeed in capturing dynamics and the other fail, we initially present a baseline model shared by both. The baseline model has no exclusion and exogenous functions determining repayments and output loss in default. After specifying the baseline model, we make different specializations and/or modifications of the baseline model to create excusable and strategic default models. We focus on the role that commitment to repay or its absence has on repayments and output loss in default.====In excusable default, commitment to repay up to ability determines repayment in default. The strategic default model can also have repayments in default but these must be motivated by costs vs. benefits and not by commitment. We follow Uribe and Schmitt-Grohe (2017)'s modification of Yue (2010)'s renegotiation model to set positive repayments in default in the SD model. Repayments increase the cost of default, reducing the magnitude of deadweight loss necessary to incentivize repayment. In excusable default, the commitment to repay itself incentivizes repayment, reducing the role of deadweight loss.==== This paper brings together the literature on sovereign risk and default, including that on strategic default, sustainable debt, and excusable default. Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), Aguiar and Gopinath (2006), and Arellano (2008) are the seminal papers on strategic default. Aguiar and Amador (2014) and Aguiar et al. (2016) provide extensions and survey extensions offered by others. This literature is focused on the implications of strategic default for business cycle moments, particularly in emerging and poor countries. It has grown very large, but with few exceptions, the model has not been applied to advanced countries.====Application to advanced countries requires modifications which allow higher debt/GDP, counter-cyclical government debt, and consumption volatility less than income volatility. To our knowledge there are no modifications which include all changes appropriate to an advanced economy. Modifications which raise equilibrium debt/GDP include the addition of long-term bonds (Hatchondo and Martinez, 2009, Chatterjee and Eyigungor, 2012) and the addition of recovery value (Uribe and Schmitt-Grohe, 2017, Hatchondo et al., 2016, Yue, 2010, Chatterjee and Eyigungor, 2015, and Arellano et al., 2019) These modifications do raise values of debt/GDP, but their authors are not trying to match values as high as those in Greece. Other authors address the increasing value of debt in advance of a crisis and its counter-cyclicality by adding either learning (Paluszynski, forthcoming), frictions in the adjustment of government expenditures (Paluszynski and Stefanidis, forthcoming), or a minimum level of government spending (Bocola et al., 2019).====The second literature we draw from is that on sustainable debt and fiscal limits. This literature is largely empirically-based and asks how high can debt become before it is unsustainable. The premise is that every government faces limits on its abilities to raise revenue and to reduce spending. The fiscal limit is defined as the maximum debt the government can repay in a particular output state. Default occurs when the government cannot pay contractual debt. Bi (2012), Bi and Leeper (2013), Bi and Traum (2014), and Daniel and Shiamptanis, 2013, Daniel and Shiamptanis, 2022 use fiscal limits as explanations of default. Debt/GDP ratios are as large as those in the data, but the behavior of the sovereign is determined either empirically or exogenously, not optimally, as in both the strategic and excusable default models.====The third literature on excusable default (Grossman and Van Huyck, 1988) is based on the fact that shocks can occur, which make full repayment of debt impossible, due to limited ability to pay. When full repayment is impossible, default is excusable and does not trigger punishment, as long as the agent pays what she is able. Adam and Grill (2017) use the concept of excusable default to design debt contracts with state-contingent repayments as risk-sharing behavior on behalf of a fully-committed sovereign.====The paper is structured as follows. Section2 lays out the strategic default model and the excusable default model. Section3 calibrates each model to Greece and presents and discusses the main quantitative results.

We find PTA membership results in a 29 percent (15 percent) decrease in the incidence of intra-PTA AD actions (measures). We then exploit variation in the content of PTAs and find the reduction is due to PTAs with explicit AD rules. We find that intra-PTA AD filings (measures) decrease by about 46 percent (34 percent) for PTAs with explicit AD rules. Our results are robust in controlling for other PTA-related phenomena, the emergence of China as the largest target of AD actions, and the role played by EU and US PTAs. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of PTA AD rules in curbing AD disputes among members.","In recent decades, the stalling of the World Trade Organization (WTO) multilateral trade agenda has been accompanied by an unprecedented proliferation of preferential trade agreements (PTAs).==== As of the end of 2021 there were over 350 PTAs in force, as compared to 20 PTAs in 1990 (WTO, 2022). The proliferation of PTAs has coincided with a substantial increase in trade disputes, primarily in the form of antidumping (AD) complaints. AD has long been the primary form of contingent protection (Prusa, 2001), but its dominance has only increased in recent decades. Since the WTO came into being in 1995 AD has accounted for an overwhelming 86 percent of contingent protection worldwide (WTO, 2021). Unlike the situation pre-1990 when only a handful of countries used AD, by the end of 2021 more than 110 countries had adopted AD statutes with 83 countries filing at least one complaint with a median number of filings per user of 32.====Both PTAs and AD are important policies in the current trade policy arena and have drawn substantial attention from both scholars and policymakers alike. Despite the empirical importance and widespread prevalence of these two trade policies, less attention has been devoted to exploring their relationship. This is a significant omission because it is well known that PTAs discriminate against members via decreasing tariffs, but it is not clear whether such discrimination is further accentuated or attenuated through the use of AD protection. On the one hand, AD is often driven by surges in imports and thus if PTAs lead to significant increases in trade flows, they might cause an increase in AD. On the other hand, PTAs, in particular the ones that contain specific AD provisions, generally discourage the use of AD on intra PTA trade. The impact of PTAs on bilateral AD disputes thus depends on which effect prevails.====In this paper, we seek to understand whether the composition of countries targeted by AD changes after the enactment of PTAs, and if so, whether the differences in AD rules across PTAs are responsible for these changes. A better understanding of the interdependence between PTAs and AD not only sheds new light on the effectiveness of preferential liberalization in freeing trade among members but also delivers significant implications for future bilateral or multilateral trade negotiations involving AD rules.====To answer these questions, we construct a dataset of worldwide AD filings (and measures) that incorporates information on PTAs in force during the 1980–2019 period. Our database has 8,243 AD disputes involving 51 users targeting 118 countries who are members of 129 active PTAs over the sample period. We apply the difference-in-differences framework to test whether PTA members experience fewer AD disputes than non-members. We find PTA membership results in a 29 percent decrease in the incidence of intra-PTA AD actions and a 15 percent decrease in intra-PTA AD measures in our benchmark specification. We then exploit differences in provisions across PTAs to examine whether the protection diminution is driven by the AD rules or it is simply due to PTA membership. Intra-PTA trade disputes might fall after the formation of PTAs because of “good will” or political closeness. We find no support for this conjecture. On the contrary, we find that PTAs with AD rules are characterized by protection attenuation, whereas PTAs without AD rules do not experience any change in intra-PTA AD activity. Specifically, intra-PTA AD actions (measures) fall by 46 percent (34 percent) for PTAs with explicit AD rules, while there is no change in AD usage for PTAs without AD rules. We note that our estimation approach does not identify whether the fall in intra-PTA AD disputes relative to inter-PTA AD disputes is due to PTA members being subject to fewer AD actions (“protection reduction”), and/or is caused by non-PTA members facing even greater AD scrutiny (“protection diversion”). It is likely that our estimates are capturing both the PTA deterring effect for members as well as the PTA dilating effect for non-members. However, we do not know the magnitude of each dimension.====A related concern involves the possibility that the change in the pattern of AD disputes is related to other PTA provisions but not AD rules. If, for example, PTAs with AD rules also tend to be deeper agreements then the interpretation of our results might change. For example, PTAs with an expansive scope and rules governing investment provisions, competition policy, etc., might result in increased bilateral imports but nevertheless have fewer intra-PTA AD petitions. It is possible that the observed reduction in intra-PTA AD activity might not cause by AD provisions but rather as a result of other PTA provisions. We investigate this possibility by controlling for the depth of PTAs. We continue to find that the presence of PTAs significantly reduces trade disputes among members and, in particular, it is the PTAs with AD rules that effectively rein in the use of such protection.====The validity of difference-in-differences method hinges on the parallel trend assumption. We check the plausibility of this assumption in several ways. First, we carry out an event study analysis by examining the year-wise change in the number of AD disputes on a set of dummies both before and after the establishment of PTAs. We find no decline in trade disputes before the years that country pairs entered PTAs, but strong evidence of decline after the PTA came into force. We also follow La Ferrara et al. (2012), Li et al. (2016), Cantoni et al. (2017), and Mattoo et al. (2017) and conduct a placebo test where we randomly assign PTA status to country pairs. There is no evidence of dispute-reducing effects when we use the placebo PTA variable. Third, we perform another placebo regression by relying on the data prior to the interventions of PTAs and find no difference in the number of AD disputes between PTA members and non-members during the pre period, demonstrating the change in the patterns of AD activity in the post-PTA does not reflect pre-existing trends.====A key challenge for our identification strategy is the possibility that the presence of PTAs among countries may be correlated with unobserved determinants of AD disputes. We follow the gravity analysis literature and employ a variety set of fixed effects (Head and Mayer, 2014, Larch et al., 2019) to alleviate this critical concern. To be precise, we first include pair and year fixed effects in the benchmark specifications and then augment the basic regressions by further adding both AD user-year and target-year fixed effects. The inclusion of three-way fixed effects drastically reduces any concerns related to omitted variables since they account for all time-invariant country-pair-specific heterogeneity and time-variant compounding factors such as demand and/or supply shocks that might impact trade disputes. We also address the concern of endogeneity due to simultaneity bias and measurement errors by running regressions controlling for anticipatory effects and errors in the effective date of the PTA. Thus, although the introduction of PTAs is not random across time and country, many differences across country pairs — other than the PTA enactment — are likely to be absorbed by our control variables, leaving us more confident that we are identifying the causal effect of PTAs on shaping AD activity.====Our work contributes to a growing literature that explores the interplay between AD protection and the implementation of preferential liberalization from the perspective of member countries. Bhagwati, 1992, Bhagwati, 1993 and Bhagwati and Panagariya (1996) were the pioneer theoretical papers to conjecture that contingent protection would amplify the discrimination created by PTA tariff preferences. Notable empirical exceptions from this line of research includes Blonigen (2005) who provides an early assessment of whether the use of dispute settlement panels in NAFTA reduce the US AD activity towards members, Ahn and Shin (2011) who study the effect of FTAs on AD filings for major AD users over the period of 1995–2009, and Silberberger and Stender (2018) who explore the interplay of regional economic integration and the use of bilateral AD measures between 1991 and 2014, explicitly taking into account the role played by the level of intra-bloc tariff concessions. Li and Qiu (2021) also investigate the effect of preferential trade arrangements on intra-PTA trade disputes from 1995 to 2007. However, they engage in a very different research design by adopting a gravity style estimation approach and examine how PTAs affect a broad set of bilateral trade disputes (i.e., WTO disputes, regional disputes, contingent protection disputes, unilateral tariffs, etc.). Our work improves upon the statistical approach of these previous papers in a number of ways. Most notably, we implement a variety of techniques to demonstrate there are no pre-existing differences in trends of AD disputes across countries using our econometric formulation. In addition, we incorporate a broader range of fixed effects to control for endogeneity biases due to the non-random formation of PTAs. Consequently, the identification of the effects of PTAs on AD activity in this paper is not confounded by the endogeneity issues present in these earlier studies. Lastly, Prusa and Zhu (2021) explore how PTAs impact the duration of AD protection, a largely overlooked aspect on AD literature but is nonetheless essential.====This paper also relates to the literature on the ramifications of preferential liberalization on trade protection against PTA outsiders, focusing on non-tariff barriers to trade. Bown and Tovar (2016) examine whether MERCOSUR has a building block or stumbling block effect on multilateral trade liberalization for Argentina and Brazil, taking into account both tariff and temporary trade barriers as the measure for import protection. In many respects, Tabakis and Zanardi (2019) is the prior work most closely to ours. They explore the implication of PTAs for their members’ extra-PTA AD measures and argue PTAs have a building block effect on multilateral liberalization. In contrast with their work, we examine the impact of PTAs on intra-PTA AD activity and also explore the importance of AD provisions in PTAs in shaping AD protection against members. Finally, our paper is loosely related to Tovar (2019) who tests the predictions from Bagwell and Staiger (1999) regarding the effect of PTAs on external import protection from a group of Latin America's countries and Tovar (2022) who explores the political-economy channel through which PTAs can affect global free trade.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The persistent output loss caused by crises is driven by lower productivity growth, which is determined by changes in product entry and exit margins in domestic and export markets. We calibrate and validate the model using unique data on firms’ product portfolios, finding they closely match the behavior of various margins during Chile's 1998 sudden stop. We decompose the sources of the welfare cost of sudden stops, finding that 30% is due to a decline in productivity growth. Lower productivity growth, in turn, is due mostly to slower firm and product entry into the domestic market, while a persistent ==== depreciation induces surviving firms to tilt their product portfolios toward export markets, driving the productivity recovery in the aftermath of the crisis.","Sudden stops - sharp contractions in capital inflows - often cause severe economic downturns in emerging economies. The persistent effect on output of this type of financial crisis is indicative of a decline in productivity. Studying the slowdown in aggregate productivity, recent work points to distortions affecting firm creation and the expansion of incumbent firms during financial crises. The literature, however, has ignored the role played by exporters in productivity dynamics during sudden stops. Because exporters are central to the trade surpluses observed during crises and are a key driver of productivity growth in open economies, this is potentially an important omission. In fact, exporting firms typically account for the bulk of productivity growth (Bernard and Jensen., 2004), and during sudden stop episodes, the ensuing exchange rate adjustment increases the demand for exports relative to domestic sales. This mechanism gives rise to differential firm and product entry rates into export and domestic markets.====We propose a unified framework to study sudden stops in which the evolution of trade and productivity dynamics shapes the aggregate response of the economy. Our model bridges the endogenous sudden stop literature (Mendoza., 2010) and theories of firm dynamics with endogenous growth (Klette and Kortum., 2004), adding to this framework product-level export dynamics. We use unique data on Chilean manufacturing firms’ product portfolios to discipline our quantitative model, and show it matches macro and micro dynamics during sudden stops. With the calibrated model, we show that the slowdown in domestic product entry rates are the key driver of the productivity loss on impact, while export product entry shapes the productivity recovery in the aftermath of the crisis.====We model a small open economy consisting of final and intermediate goods producers. Firms in the intermediate-goods sector innovate to introduce domestic and export product lines. Final-good producers demand intermediate inputs to produce. These firms own a productive asset used as collateral for borrowing to finance working capital. Series of favorable productivity and interest rate shocks cause increases in leverage. Unfavorable shocks arriving at times of high leverage make the collateral constraint binding, raising the effective cost of borrowing during a financial crisis and decreasing the demand of tradable final good producers for intermediate inputs.====Sudden stops have a starkly different impact on exporters and non-exporters. Intermediate goods sold domestically face a lower demand, and therefore lower profits, due to the local crisis. The lower value of domestic product lines reduces product entry into the domestic market by both new and incumbent firms. In contrast, exported products do not rely entirely on local demand, and exports benefit from lower wages while facing a stable foreign demand. This is a classic real exchange rate effect favoring exporters during crises. Therefore, the value of export product lines increases relative to domestic ones, generating incentives for incumbent firms to invest in innovation to introduce exported products. Consistent with the empirical evidence in Alessandria et al. (2014), the extensive margin of exports adjusts gradually and drives a sluggish recovery in productivity.====We discipline the model using novel data on firms’ product portfolios. We use unique firm-level data from the Chilean manufacturing census that lists each firm's entire set of products with revenue split between local and foreign sales. The model is calibrated to match the firm-level product portfolio distribution. To validate the model, we document that the model accurately replicates a series of micro and macroeconomic moments. First, the dynamics of firms’ product portfolios are central to our framework, and we document the model matches them closely. For instance, the probability that a firm introduces a product in the domestic market is increasing in the firm's number of existing products, and the probability that a firm starts exporting a product previously sold only domestically is increasing in the number of domestic products. Although these moments were not used in the calibration, the model is able to replicate these patterns accurately. Next, and given that our model features endogenous firm dynamics, we further validate it showing that it can accurately replicate the firm size distribution in terms of both employment and number of products sold. In addition, because trade dynamics play a central role in our discussion of productivity, we show the model closely matches exporter premia in terms of revenue, employment and productivity. And because from a macroeconomic perspective our interest is in financial crises, we also validate the model by exploring the response of macroeconomic outcomes to a sudden stop, and contrast it to the evolution of these outcomes during the Chilean 1998 sudden stop.====We then use the calibrated model to illustrate and quantify how the behavior of trade and productivity dynamics shape the response of the economy to sudden stops. Following a sudden stop, as local demand collapses, imports of intermediate goods fall substantially while exports of intermediate goods are more stable, which improves the trade balance. In the model, while imports collapse mostly through an intensive margin adjustment, exports adjust entirely through the extensive margin. This export adjustment is primarily driven by reduced entry into exporting by new firms. During the recovery, the decline in the domestic wage and real exchange rate depreciation increase export profits relative to domestic profits. This induces innovation by incumbent firms aiming to start exporting products that they currently sold only domestically, resulting in exports driving the recovery from sudden stops. To understand the effect of firm-level innovation decisions on aggregate productivity, we decompose productivity growth highlighting the contribution of entrants and incumbents. This decomposition shows that the immediate productivity slowdown during a sudden stop is driven by a decline in product entry to the domestic market. After illustrating these mechanisms, we show that they are supported by the data, as in the aftermath of Chile's 1998 sudden stop, firms tilted their product portfolios toward exported products. In addition, we find that following the sudden stop, for each given firm and product, export revenue falls less relative to revenue from the domestic market especially in industries with a high degree of financial dependence. This is consistent with the financial nature of crises in our model.====We then use our model to study to what extent productivity and trade dynamics account for the welfare loss from a sudden stop. Consumers would be willing to forgo 4.6% of their consumption the period before the crisis to avoid an average sudden stop. We then analyze counterfactuals that keep constant the domestic and/or export innovation rates. We find that about 30% of this welfare loss is due to the endogenous slowdown in productivity growth. Lower productivity growth on impact is explained entirely by lower entry rates for domestic products, while higher entry rates for exported products drive the recovery after the crisis.====We conclude with a brief discussion of the policy implications of our framework, which we analyze at length in the Appendix. Given the pecuniary externality arising from the occasionally binding borrowing constraint, we study a tax on foreign borrowing, which reduces the welfare cost of the crisis but implies a large sacrifice in “normal times”. In addition, given the externalities caused by firms’ innovation decisions, we analyze an innovation subsidy, which raises growth in normal times but magnifies the cost of crises. We show that a combination of these two policies can improve welfare.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1.1 reviews the related literature. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 calibrates and validates the model. Section 4 uses the calibrated model to analyze the impact of sudden stops on trade and productitivty dynamics and on welfare.

We provide a detailed dive into this borrowing by showing that it happened in one particular market segment. Firms significantly increased their large bond issuances, mostly above US$500 million, which became cheaper to issue. We find a strong clustering of issuances with a face value of exactly $500 million after 2008 compared to developed markets. This suggests increased willingness from investors, especially cross-over investors, to purchase emerging market bonds included in newly created bond indexes, which require a minimum face value of $500 million. However, not all firms could issue such large bonds. Firms large enough to do so faced a trade-off. Issuing index-eligible bonds allowed them to borrow at a lower cost at the expense of accumulating cash. Because of this “size yield discount,” many companies increased their issuances of index-eligible bonds, accumulating cash holdings.","After the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), emerging market corporations substantially increased their issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. The dollar credit issued by non-financial emerging market corporates more than doubled between 2010 and 2018, when this type of credit reached 3.7 trillion U.S. dollars (Bruno and Shin, 2020). A large literature already focuses on the boom in foreign currency bond issuances and overall corporate debt, discussing the drivers and implications of high dollar debt (Chui et al., 2014, Chui et al., 2016; Acharya et al., 2015; Beltran et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2017; Alfaro et al., 2019). This surge coincided with a rise in international debt flows to emerging economies (Avdjiev et al., 2014; Ayala et al., 2017).====In this paper, we provide a detailed dive into the post-GFC rise in bond issuance activity by emerging market corporations. By documenting the nature of this boom, we show which types of firms borrowed heavily, the role of institutional investors in facilitating it, and the consequences of the nature of the boom. Specifically, we show that the growth in U.S. dollar-denominated issuances after 2008 was driven by one particular segment of the market, large bonds. These bonds had lower (not higher) yields than bonds with a lower face value and enjoyed a greater reduction in yields at issuance over time compared with smaller bonds. These facts are consistent with the supply side of capital being important in explaining the increase in large bond issuances. We show that newly created emerging market corporate debt benchmark indexes and institutional investors from developed economies seem important for the observed behavior of issuances and yields of large bonds, and consequently for the overall market of international bonds. Firms responded to the lower yields by issuing larger bonds than they otherwise would have chosen, raising their cash holdings.====The analysis of the paper starts by documenting that the increase in issuances by emerging market firms after 2008 was driven by bonds above US$500 million (U.S. dollars or $). This feature was much more muted in the pre-2008 period and for a control sample of investment-grade developed market firms. Firm-level regressions confirm this result even after controlling for firm fixed effects. We also document the presence of significantly lower yields at issuance of those large bonds relative to otherwise similar bonds with lower face values. We label this yield differential the “size yield discount.” This discount widened relative to the period before the GFC and became larger for emerging market issuers than for developed market ones. Secondary market yields of large bonds were also lower than those of smaller bonds after the GFC, even when comparing daily yields of the same emerging market firm with multiple outstanding bonds. Those differences were close to zero for developed market firms.====We also show that most of the large bond issuances were of exactly $500 million, a value that generates a visible discrete jump in the distribution of issuances. The yields for those bonds were lower than those of bonds with a face value below $500 million. This threshold is important because the most important benchmark index for emerging market corporations, the J.P. Morgan CEMBI Index created in 2007, requires bonds to have a face value equal to or greater than $500 million to be part of it.==== One would not expect new investment opportunities that lead to greater funding needs to be clustered at issuance amounts of exactly $500 million. To the contrary, the evidence suggests that inclusion in benchmark indexes and the supply of capital through institutional investors that follow those indexes played a significant role in the issuance of large bonds.====The new indexes might have helped solidify investor interest in large bonds by putting them explicitly in benchmarks that most investors follow, providing a clear point of reference for buyers and sellers and thereby giving a liquidity advantage to those bonds. In fact, we document that both emerging market specialist and non-specialist mutual funds increased their exposure to emerging market debt as they received injections after 2008. Perhaps more notable is that non-specialist funds that focused on developed market securities, which we call “cross-over” institutional investors, significantly increased their holdings of emerging market corporate debt after the GFC. Such funds were less familiar with emerging market corporate debt before the GFC and, in general, tend to be much larger than emerging market specialist funds. Cross-over funds invested significantly more of their portfolio in bonds with a face value of at least $500 million relative to funds that specialized in emerging market securities. We show that when funds, especially cross-over funds, exerted demand pressure on emerging market large bonds, the size yield discount widened.====Our results above suggest that when deciding to issue a large index-eligible bond, firms face a trade-off. On the one hand, they can secure cheaper financing costs. On the other hand, if issuance size exceeds financing needs, firms must save the difference in cash, which has low returns. Our evidence shows that the post-2008 widening of the size yield discount seemed to have moved the trade-off in favor of issuing $500 million bonds. Firms chose to issue larger bonds to fund their projects by reaching the $500 million threshold, but to take advantage of the cost saving from issuing large bonds, they needed to be large enough to be able to use the proceeds from a large bond issuance. In fact, firms with small asset size did not issue large bonds either before or after 2008. Moreover, medium-sized firms saw the largest increase in the probability of issuing large bonds after 2008. These two findings are also consistent with investor appetite for large bonds driving changes in bond issuances, as there is no obvious reason why changes in financing needs should have suddenly become different across firm size categories after 2008.====Last, we estimate how firms used issuance proceeds, distinguishing between the behavior of relatively large- and medium-sized firms that issued large bonds. We show that emerging market firms that issued bonds above $500 million after 2008 tended to hold more cash for every dollar of debt issued than firms that issued smaller amounts. This result provides direct evidence of the trade-off firms faced when issuing large index-eligible bonds after 2008: they could secure lower financing costs at the expense of accumulating cash. The increased holding of cash was greater for medium-sized firms that issued large bonds than for large firms that issued large bonds. This is consistent with medium-sized firms “stretching” to issue more debt than necessary to fund their investments to take advantage of the size yield discount. Firms in countries with higher expected carry trade profit (our proxy for domestic currency-denominated return on cash) issued more $500 million bonds, providing further evidence that firms responded to a trade-off when deciding to issue large bonds and hold cash.====Our paper contributes to different strands of the literature. First, we add to a growing literature that studies how the low interest rate environment after the GFC encouraged U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bond issuances around the world at the expense of other forms of financing, such as bank borrowing (Shin, 2014; Becker and Ivashina, 2015; Carabarín et al., 2015; McCauley et al., 2015; Lo Duca et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018; Avdjiev et al., 2022).==== We show that emerging market firms issued mostly large and less expensive bonds of $500 million after the GFC and that the investor side seems important to explain this new stylized fact. This is important because it shows that the way in which capital flows are intermediated through institutional investors that follow indexes appears to determine which firms borrow in those markets and the cost of raising capital across the size distribution of bonds.==== Moreover, the fact that the international bond market organized in a very particular way, with issuances concentrated at exactly $500 million, marks a difference with other financial markets, such as banks, where borrowing is spread evenly across sizes, typically according to the amount needed by the borrower.====Second, our paper contributes to a literature on the effects of inclusion in stock market indexes (Shleifer, 1986; Barberis et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2015). Our contribution is our focus on bond indexes, which present important differences with equity indexes. The institution assembling an equity index decides whether or not to incorporate a publicly traded firm in the index. In the case of bond indexes, firms decide whether to participate in an index by issuing bonds that meet the qualification requirements. We exploit this difference to understand which firms exercised that choice and how they did so. Moreover, bond indexes allow us to estimate the benefits of index inclusion by comparing the issuance outcomes for firms that have outstanding bonds that are both included and not included in an index. This within-firm comparison allows us to control for unobserved factors by contrasting different bonds, sometimes even within the same date. Yields on bonds allow us to measure the financing cost and therefore the “benchmark inclusion subsidy” (Kashyap et al., 2021).==== This is not as straightforward for equities because firms typically have one stock that is either included or not in the index.====Third, we contribute to the literature that studies how changes in the supply of capital can trigger effects on firms' decisions. Several papers argue that changes on the investor side can impact asset prices in different financial markets.==== A related but separate strand of the literature shows how changes in benchmark indexes might affect investor behavior and ultimately affect asset prices.==== Our paper adds to this literature by providing evidence consistent with changes in the supply side of capital influencing the types of securities that firms issue and having an effect on the firm size distribution of corporate debt issuers. Additionally, our paper provides new evidence for the literature on how different types of bond mutual funds invest in various securities and can thus impact the cost of capital for firms.==== Our findings across advanced and emerging economies expand the evidence from the United States that higher interest from passive fund investors increased firms' propensity to issue bonds (Dathan and Davydenko, 2018). Our evidence also suggests that the structure of corporate bond markets can create incentives for large borrowing by firms that can issue large bonds, who might end up both more leveraged and with more cash (Bates et al., 2009; Falato et al., 2013; Bruno and Shin, 2017; Xiao, 2018; Begenau and Palazzo, 2021).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data. Section 3 reports the evidence on large bond issuances and yields. Section 4 examines the role of the supply side of capital in driving our results. Section 5 analyzes additional evidence about which types of firms respond to the incentives to issue large bonds and how they use the proceeds from those bond issuances.

We use novel data to trace those banks to a corporate deposit funding platform. As they sought to replace the lost dollar funding, the funding squeeze spilled over to other banks with no MMF exposure. The latter paid more for corporate dollar deposits, and their pool of funding providers deteriorated. Their dollar lending volumes and margins declined. Our results suggest banks’ competitiveness in funding markets affect their competitiveness in lending markets.","Dry-ups in funding markets often lead to financial crises, with adverse macroeconomic consequences. Understanding their dynamics is therefore important. However, isolating the effect of a funding dry-up from broader crisis effects is a challenge for empirical research, as they usually go hand-in-hand. We study the dynamics of funding dry-ups by exploiting a policy event, the US money market fund (MMF) reform, that led to a wholesale funding shortfall in only one market during an otherwise tranquil period.====We first provide evidence of a new channel through which funding dry-ups spill over from one funding market to others across borders. When banks face a funding shortage in one market, they substitute into other sources of funding, intensifying competition in those markets. As a result, banks that are not directly affected by the original funding dry-up might nevertheless face a funding squeeze, as they are crowded out by the directly affected banks in the latter's search for alternative funding. Banks affected by the MMF reform only through spillovers had to increase the rates they pay for wholesale corporate deposit funding by 20–30% relative to their pre-reform average.====These spillovers could be material, in that they could affect bank lending. We show that banks that ultimately suffer from a funding dry-up indirectly through spillovers grant relatively less dollar loans despite charging a lower price. These results suggest that banks’ competitiveness in funding markets affect their competitiveness in lending markets.====The MMF reform constitutes close to an ideal setting to study channels of spillovers from a funding squeeze. In addition to taking place during an otherwise tranquil period for financial markets, it directly affected only banks that actively borrow from MMFs (which we call MMF banks). This allows for a clean distinction between MMF banks and banks with no direct exposure to MMFs (which we call non-MMF banks). Moreover, since it only affected the dollar wholesale funding of banks, the reform should only have an impact in dollar markets and not in other currencies. We extensively rely on funding segments in other currencies throughout the paper and conduct placebo tests to provide evidence for spillovers of funding dry-ups.====We combine three granular datasets to study spillovers in funding markets and their effect on bank lending. First, we identify banks that suffered a loss in dollar funding due to the reform by using transaction-level data from the regulatory filings of US MMFs. Second, we use a unique and granular dataset from one of the largest corporate deposit trading platforms located in Europe. In the platform, firms auction deposits and banks bid for them. The dataset contains bid-level information on deposit auctions in various currencies. Our main focus is on transactions in dollars since the reform induced a wholesale dollar funding shortage. However, we use information on deposits in other currencies as a key robustness check which allows us to show that spillovers occur only for banks’ dollar funding. Third, we use data on syndicated loans to study changes in the lending behavior of banks in our sample.====As a key part of our identification strategy, we compare MMF and non-MMF banks, pre- and post-reform across different currencies. This difference-in-difference-in-differences estimation rules out alternative explanations such as non-MMF banks potentially having higher funding costs during our sample period for reasons unrelated to the US MMF reform, the possibility that differences in the two groups of banks such as their country of origin might explain results, or the possibility that a non-random matching between MMFs and banks explains our results in the corporate deposit platform. Our regression analysis effectively compares borrowing in multiple currencies by the ==== bank. In particular, we show that while there are spillovers in dollar-denominated corporate deposits after the reform, there is no impact on pound-denominated corporate deposits between the same set of firms and banks.====The terms of funding that banks obtain from MMFs versus corporate depositors vary substantially. This is reflected in the segmentation of markets in the pre-reform period. MMF funding is on average more expensive, but it also offers longer-term and more stable funding. In our sample, some banks are active in both markets, while others only participate in the corporate deposit market.==== We take this as evidence that banks active in both markets have a stronger preference for stable funding.==== We also differentiate between corporate depositors and divide them into two categories: stable funding providers and others, depending on how persistently they place corporate deposit auctions. We present evidence that banks active in both markets are also the ones preferred by firms, especially by stable funding providers in the pre-reform period.====The inferences we make about the ranking of preferences by banks and firms lead naturally to hypotheses that we test using the MMF reform as an exogenous funding shock. After the implementation of the reform, MMF banks lost unsecured funding from MMFs, their preferred source of funding. We conjecture that after the MMF reform, these banks would resort to less preferred unsecured funding sources such as large corporate deposits. Since these banks are also preferred by firms, this would mean either a loss of deposits or a rise in deposit rates for non-MMF banks due to intensified competition in the corporate deposit market. Moreover, we expect that these effects are stronger for funding offered by firms that are stable funding providers.====We show that after the reform, non-MMF banks pay higher deposit rates than MMF banks in order to retain their corporate deposit funding. Moreover, we document a composition effect and explain the higher deposit spread that non-MMF banks pay after the reform. Once MMF banks lost MMF funding and intensified competition for corporate deposits, they crowded-out non-MMF banks by securing funding from firms that are most alike MMFs, i.e. stable and large deposit-providing firms. Non-MMF banks were forced to form new relationships with less stable funding providers by bidding higher prices. Importantly, we show that these effects only apply to dollar deposits – there is no effect on pound deposits around the time of the MMF reform. This suggests that the effect is driven by spillovers due to the reform rather than any unobserved heterogeneity between the two groups of banks.====We then focus on the implications of those spillovers in wholesale funding markets on bank lending. In the aftermath of the reform, the lending rates that non-MMF banks charge, controlling for loan characteristics, are lower relative to MMF banks. So is their lending in dollars. We use an empirical design in the spirit of Khwaja and Mian (2008) to control for loan demand and compare the ==== firm borrowing in dollars from MMF and non-MMF banks. In this way we rule out that potential confounding effects related to firms’ demand for loans from non-MMF banks might be driving results. On the liability side, non-MMF banks pay more for funding, and at the same time their lending mark-ups decrease, leading to a relative decline in profit margins. Taken together, the results point to a loss of competitiveness in lending markets driven by the loss of competitiveness in funding markets and suggest that funding dry-ups might lead to concentration in the banking sector.====Finally, going beyond our core results that take MMF and non-MMF as two homogeneous groups, we provide evidence of competition for funding within these groups of banks. Within MMF banks, we show that those that lost most funding from institutional prime funds (i.e., the funds directly affected by the reform) intensified competition for other types of MMF funding, namely from government/Treasury funds and retail prime funds. Within non-MMF banks, we present evidence that those banks that competed more frequently with MMF banks in auctions pre-reform increased their bids the most post-reform. Taken together with previous our findings, these results highlight that the outcome of competition can vary in segmented markets in which one group of banks compete between each other or with a different group of banks.",Spillovers of funding dry-ups,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219962200054X,22 April 2022,2022,Research Article,86.0

The latter can be decomposed into contributions from cross-country differences in (2====) relative wages and (2====) skill-biased factor-augmenting technologies. To investigate the relative importance of each, we develop a multi-sector Eaton-Kortum model featuring skilled/unskilled labour and factor-augmenting international technology differences. The model is calibrated to WIOD data for 39 countries in 2006. Using a model-based decomposition, we show that the skill-intensity mechanism is much more important than output-mix. Further, differences in skill intensities across countries are explained in similar proportions by the relative-wage mechanism and the technology mechanism. Our results have immediate implications for the impact of endowments and skill-biased technology on output mix, trade in goods, and international differences in skill premia.","Two major themes dominate the vast literature on how endowments affect international trade and domestic wages. Stated as decompositions, these themes are:====Many questions in the trade literature are fundamentally about the relative importance of the terms in these two decompositions. Most obviously, the impact of endowments on goods trade is likely big when 1==== is large relative to 1==== (e.g., Romalis, 2004, Chor, 2010) and the effect of exogenous changes in factor supplies on wages can be muted by these output-mix responses as well e.g., Burstein et al. (2020). The wage impacts of migration-induced endowment shifts can also be offset by the skill upgrading of 2==== e.g., Gandal et al. (2004) and Dustmann and Glitz (2015). Trefler, 1993, Trefler, 1995 and Davis and Weinstein (2001) offer competing views as to whether the failure of the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek factor content prediction is due to departures from factor price equalization (2====), factor-augmenting international technology differences (2====), or trade costs.====Despite the well-known importance of these two decompositions and the many excellent country-level studies of them that we review below, an important addition to our stock of knowledge would be a cross-country study of the decompositions within a unified framework. Such an exercise faces two challenges. First, there are many other primitives (e.g. technology, preferences, trade costs, and other countries’ endowments) that may change as countries accumulate factors of production. We therefore cannot use a data-based decomposition to assess the causal effect of changes in endowments on output mix and skill intensities. Therefore we use a full general equilibrium model to assess how an exogenous change in endowments is absorbed. To do this, we set up a multi-factor, multi-sector (Eaton and Kortum, 2002) model featuring the interindustry linkages of Caliendo and Parro (2015) and CES substitution possibilities between skilled and unskilled labour as in Parro (2013) and Burstein and Vogel (2017). Second, while there are various ways of estimating factor-augmenting international technology differences (Caselli and Coleman, 2006, Trefler, 1993, Malmberg, 2017), none of these is consistent with our model.==== We therefore develop a new method of estimating factor-augmenting international technology differences. We calibrate the model using WIOD data (Timmer et al., 2015) for 39 countries and 23 industries in 2006. Our core results are also repeated for 1995. The model provides a unified framework for our two decompositions.====Having calibrated our model we turn to our first decomposition. In the ‘between’ and ‘within’ language of decompositions, we use the quantitative model to trace out the impact of a change in endowments on (1====) between-industry output mixes and (1====) within-industry skill intensities. Specifically, we consider the following thought experiment: If we reduce a country's endowments-based comparative advantage by altering its endowments, what share of these endowment changes would be absorbed by between-industry shifts in output versus within-industry shifts in skill intensities? In a standard Heckscher-Ohlin world under factor price equalization, such an exercise would imply that 1==== accounts for 100% of the decomposition. In a single-sector model, that share would obviously be 0%. We find that for all countries, output mix plays a small role in absorbing changes in endowments: On average, output mix accounts for only 2.3% of the decomposition and skill intensity accounts for the remaining 97.7%. In short, the output-mix channel is only a small part of the adjustment mechanism. In our literature review, we document that this stark result appears in many (though not all) individual-country studies on the effects of migration.====Does our result conflict with existing evidence of Rybczynski and Heckscher-Ohlin effects e.g., Baldwin (1971), Romalis (2004), Chor (2010), and Morrow (2010)? The answer is no. When we run regressions based on Romalis (2004) using our data, we replicate his findings. This points to the distinction between (====) observing that output-mix changes have the ==== predicted by our theories and (====) finding that these changes are important in ==== for how countries absorb their endowments.====We next turn to our second decomposition, decomposing cross-country skill-intensity differences into contributions from (2====) cross-country wage differences and (2====) factor-augmenting international technology differences. To show this in a quantitative model we proceed as follows. In any country ====, the skill intensity of an industry – meaning the requirement of skilled labour relative to unskilled labour – is a function among other things of the relative wage and the skill bias of factor-augmenting technology (====). We consider the thought experiment of ‘switching off’ the factor-augmenting technology parameters by setting the ==== to unity in all countries. Just as in the case of our endowments thought experiment there will be impacts on output mix and, via general-equilibrium wage changes, impacts on skill intensities. The latter is our 2====. In addition, there is an effect not present with endowment changes, namely, the direct impacts of skill-biased technology on skill intensities. This is our 2====. We find that the output-mix effect is very small and that 2==== and 2==== are of comparable size.==== In addition to being of intrinsic interest to the migration and Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek literatures noted above, this ties our results into the literature on induced technical change e.g., Acemoglu (1998) and Burstein and Vogel (2017).====While the ==== are important for our decompositions, it is good to establish their importance more generally. To this end, we compare the role of the ==== to the role of the Ricardian technology parameters, parameters that have been documented as important elsewhere e.g., Costinot et al. (2012). Specifically, we compare the effects of switching off the ==== with the effects of switching off the Ricardian technology parameters on equilibrium unit input requirements.==== Here we look not just at skill intensities, which should not be much affected by Ricardian considerations, but at the levels of factor demands and wages. When we do this, we find that the two sets of technology parameters have comparable counterfactual power. Hence, our emphasis on factor-augmenting technologies is appropriate in terms of being quantitatively important.====Our decomposition of skill intensities into wages and technology bears directly on an older debate about the failure of the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek factor content of trade prediction. While there are many explanations for its failure, two prominent ones are departures from factor price equalization and factor-augmenting productivity differences.==== Davis and Weinstein (2001) point to the failure of factor price equalization and arrive at this conclusion by showing that international differences in factor intensities are driven by international differences in factor prices. In contrast, Trefler (1993) points to international differences in factor-augmenting technology and arrives at this conclusion by considering productivity-adjusted skill intensities. Our decomposition of skill intensities shows that factor prices and factor-augmenting technology are ==== important. It follows that Davis and Weinstein (2001) and Trefler (1993) were both right, but that each had only a partial picture of the problem. We are able to show this because of advances in quantitative modelling which allow us to endogenize wages, an advance that was not available to these researchers. We close by asking whether taking these two factors into account is enough to rescue the Vanek equation. The answer is no: Even after taking these into account, there is still missing trade that we then unpack using our quantitative model.====Our approach is subject to a few limitations. First and foremost, we do not endogenize factor-augmenting technology. This cannot be over-emphasized. Second, the WIOD data we use is very aggregated (23 sectors in the economy). Therefore, some between-industry output reallocation is not captured by the data e.g., a shift within apparel from sewing to cutting. This likely contributes to why only 2.3% of endowment absorption is due to industry re-allocation. However, if with finer data this number doubled or tripled, it would make little difference to our headline conclusion that absorption is largely driven by within-industry differences in skill intensities. Third, we do not estimate the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labour (====). There are two views on this. On the one hand, it is a defect not to be using an internally consistent measure of ====. On the other hand, doing so would likely overfit the data, thus limiting the value of the exercise. Given the availability of high-quality estimates of ==== (e.g., Acemoglu and Autor, 2011), we prefer not to estimate it, though others may reasonably have a different view.","How do endowments determine trade? quantifying the output mix, factor price, and skill-biased technology channels",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000526,20 April 2022,2022,Research Article,87.0

Standards define product characteristics that ensure compatibility, quality and consistency. Harmonized standards unify these characteristics across countries and reduce country-specific adaption costs. We create a novel database on cross-country standards and show that harmonized standards have contributed up to 13% of the growth in global trade. We build a heterogeneous firm model where harmonized standards generate scale effects and induce firms to adopt the standard. Firm-level evidence shows that only the largest firms in the top range of the size-distribution increase their export sales. These firms benefit from higher demand, charge higher prices and sell larger volumes.","Product standards are omnipresent and affect production processes in virtually all industries (ISO, 2016). Prominent examples are A4 paper format, electrical plugs or 4G mobile phone standards. Over the last decades, international standard-setting organizations (SSOs) have dominated the standard development process by releasing harmonized voluntary product standards that adopters can choose to use in their production processes. This silent form of trade integration, which is not necessarily the result of government trade policy, shapes the way firms produce and sell their output abroad.====The benefits of standards have already been pointed out as early as Kindleberger (1983). Through standardization, firms can overcome information asymmetries (Leland, 1979), increase product quality (Ronnen, 1991), ensure interoperability and take advantage of positive network effects (Katz and Shapiro, 1985, Farrell and Saloner, 1985). For example, quality and technical standards enable firms to organize production processes more effectively and increase product quality (Verhoogen, 2008). They allow consumers to better assess product attributes through certification or labeling. Compatibility standards (think of screw threads or mobile phone standards) allow for network effects and economies of scale, thus facilitating supply chains and mass production.====If standards are specific to each country, high investment costs prevent firms, and ultimately consumers, from reaping the benefits of standardization, which is especially important in a globalized world where products are sold internationally. When adapting products and processes to a specific standard in each country, producers must design standard-compatible blueprints, retool machines and potentially reorganize plants. Harmonized standard releases, i.e. the explicit accreditation of the same standard by several national SSOs, unify product characteristics across countries and reduce country-specific investment costs. Firms no longer need to change their production process when selling to a different country, resulting in more firms choosing to adopt the standard. The uniformity of product characteristics across countries may also increase the marketability of products. For example, producers using 4G mobile phone standards ensure that their products not only work in many countries but are also compatible with applications such as mobile web access, IP telephony and video conferencing.====The main contribution of this paper is to highlight the release of harmonized, voluntary standards as a novel channel of higher trade integration and to quantify its effect on international trade. By shifting the focus from regulatory to voluntary standards and their harmonization, we depart from the trade literature that views product standards through a regulatory lens. Voluntary standards span beyond the health, safety and environmental aspects usually covered by regulatory standards. Our database includes more than one million standards, of which almost half are harmonized, thereby largely outnumbering the number of regulatory standards commonly found in databases on non-tariff barriers.==== Voluntary standards are developed by standard-setting organizations (SSOs), where industry experts work together to agree on the formal specification of product characteristics. Their release differs from trade policy efforts where governments mandate product characteristics through regulatory standards and prohibit non-compliant firms from selling their products.==== Voluntary standards give firms the option to change their production structure. As our analysis shows below, this difference has important implications for the firm-size distribution.====To construct our novel bilateral product-level database, we track the release and accreditation of foreign and international standards for each SSO within the Searle Center Database on Technology Standards, Industry Consortia and Innovation (Baron and Spulber, 2018). We define standard harmonization as the decision of a national SSO to accredit a standard that is also released in another country. To assign standard documents to products in the trade data, we use a newly developed concordance table between the International Classification for Standards (ICS) and the Harmonized System (HS). Our final sample contains bilateral product-level trade flows and standard releases for 20 industrialized countries and several major emerging economies for the period 1995–2014.====To quantify the effect of standard harmonization on international trade, we follow a difference-in-difference approach. Our results show that, on average, the introduction of harmonized standards increases product-level trade flows by 0.59%. This marginal effect is amplified by the fact that every year harmonized standards are released in more than 40% of all bilateral product-level trade flow pairs. Overall, we estimate the average contribution to global trade growth to be 0.30 percentage points per year. This increase represents five times the contribution of tariff reductions over our sample period.====We provide evidence that the assumptions of our difference-in-difference approach are satisfied and address potential endogeneity concerns. First, we show that there are no significant differences in pre-trends between harmonized and non-harmonized products. Second, we provide evidence that our results are not driven by the fact that harmonized standards may be primarily released in product categories with larger trade flows or higher growth rates. Third, we mitigate the endogeneity concern that firms’ participation in SSOs’ activities determine the release of harmonized standards. To this end, we take advantage of the supranational character of so-called European Standards. Fourth, we instrument country-specific harmonization events by accreditations of neighboring countries. The estimates of the instrumental variables approach are not significantly different from our baseline OLS estimates, suggesting that the latter estimates are causal.====The voluntary nature of product standards implies that our product-level estimate depends on the number of firms that choose to adopt the standard and their change in export sales. To build intuition for this firm-selection effect, we construct a multi-country model with heterogeneous firms and endogenous standard adoption, i.e. firms decide to produce a standardized or a non-standardized variety of a differentiated product. Product standards capture product attributes, such as quality, compatibility, safety or environmental aspects, which consumers value. Producing standardized varieties requires sunk investment costs and potentially higher marginal costs.==== The presence of sunk investment costs implies a selection effect where large high-productivity firms choose to produce in accordance with the standard, while small low-productivity firms decide to produce the non-standardized variety. Because of higher demand for standardized varieties, only those firms able to cover the investment costs increase their export sales. The release of a ==== standard across countries enables more firms to reap the benefits of standardization because firms pay the sunk investment cost only once while receiving higher product demand in all countries that release the harmonized standard.====To quantify the selection effect and the heterogeneous responses across the firm-size distribution, we use firm-level data obtained from French custom declarations. A limitation is that the data do not allow us to identify the firms that choose to produce in accordance with the harmonized standard. For this reason, we exploit the predictions of the model and test whether the marginal effect of standard harmonization affects export participation and varies with firm size, trade costs as well as destination country characteristics. A decomposition of our baseline product-level specification into the extensive margin (number of exporters) and intensive margin (average export sales) shows that harmonized standards increase trade through higher average sales of existing exporters and has no significant effect on firm entry. When we split firms into size-bins according to their overall sales, only the largest exporters in the highest quartile experience positive and significant effects. Their export sales increase by 1.1%, while the effect is insignificant for remaining firms. High sunk investment costs imply that only few firms choose to invest in the standard and explain why the treatment effect at the firm-level is twice as large as at the product-level.====We further show that this size-dependent selection effect of harmonized standards increases with destination country size, lower bilateral trade costs and the number of countries releasing the harmonized standard. These heterogeneous effects are consistent with the model. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence of harmonized standards shifting demand towards standardized varieties. We find that the positive effects increase with the degree of product differentiation and are greater for standards whose purpose it is to signal quality or reduce information frictions.====The effect of releasing harmonized standards is similar to the mechanism described in the literature on technology and quality upgrading following trade policy shocks. Improved access to foreign markets through lower tariffs or an exchange rate depreciation generates scale effects and induces firms to upgrade their quality (Verhoogen, 2008) or technology (Lileeva and Trefler, 2010, Bustos, 2011). Another channel is the cost reduction of intermediate inputs through a reduction in import tariffs that leads to quality upgrading (Amiti and Khandelwal, 2013, Fan et al., 2015, Bas and Strauss-Kahn, 2015).==== In comparison, this paper provides novel evidence of another trade shock that stimulates firm investment. By unifying product characteristics across countries, the release of harmonized voluntary standards induces firms to upgrade their products. Firms benefit from higher product demand and save on country-specific investment costs to adapt their products to the destination market, similar to the scenario considered by Arkolakis et al. (2021). Overall, our results suggest that these harmonization efforts are an important driver of global trade.====Related to the literature on trade policy uncertainty (e.g. Handley and Limão, 2017; Steinberg, 2019), the release of harmonized voluntary product standards is also a non-regulatory trade policy shock. Handley and Limão (2017) show that absent any changes in regulatory trade policy (such as tariffs), the reduction in the likelihood of higher tariff rates can stimulate firm-entry investment today because of higher expected future revenues. One feature of voluntary product standards is that they can reduce uncertainty about product characteristics. The certification and labeling of products via standards can reduce costs for buyers to evaluate the product before purchase. To the extent that compliance with standards requires sunk investment costs, which is similar to the fixed costs of entry into foreign markets considered by Handley and Limão (2017), the implied firm selection effects are similar in the two models: large and high-productivity firms are more likely to invest.====The paper also relates to the empirical international trade literature on product standards. While regulatory product standards are usually thought of as trade barriers, the seminal contribution by Swann et al. (1996) shows that standards promote exports. Blind (2004) emphasizes the trade-enhancing effects of standardization through quality improvements and economies of scale.==== Chen and Novy (2012) also show that standards are associated with lower bilateral trade costs. More recently, Fontagné et al. (2015) and Fernandes et al. (2019) analyze firm dynamics and show that restrictive regulatory standards have a detrimental impact on firm-level export sales and net entry, but less so for larger firms.==== We add to this literature by pointing out the different selection effects on exporting for regulatory and voluntary standards and their implications on the firm-size distribution. While regulatory standards have been shown to mainly affect smaller exporters, the empirical evidence in this paper finds that voluntary standards increase predominantly the sales of the largest exporters.====Some papers analyze specifically the effect of cross-country standard harmonization on trade flows for certain regulations within a subset of industries or countries. Chen and Mattoo (2008) use information on EU/EFTA harmonization and mutual recognition agreements and find that trade flows increase between participating countries, but exports of excluded countries can actually decrease. Disdier et al. (2015) also show that harmonization between Northern and Southern countries is associated with increasing trade flows and point out the trade-deflecting effect on South-South trade. Reyes (2011) shows that the harmonization of EU electronics standards led to an increase in the number of US firms exporting to the EU in that sector.====The increased referencing of product standards in trade agreements (Baldwin, 2011) has led to an increase in the number of papers that study the regulatory aspects of harmonizing product standards. For example, Mei (2018) studies the welfare effects of regulatory standards using a quantitative general-equilibrium model. He finds that countries increase their welfare by 1.4% when setting a harmonized standard that is common to all countries. Parenti and Vannoorenberghe (2022) study the decision to coordinate on common product standards within a trade agreement when countries have different regulatory preferences. If divergence in these preferences is small, countries gain from signing a trade agreement featuring standard harmonization. Maggi and Ossa (2020) analyze how the decision to sign such an agreement changes if regulators are subject to industry lobbying. Grossman et al. (2021) study optimal regulatory policies and tariffs within a trade agreement when countries differ in their preferences for horizontally differentiated products. They evaluate different scenarios and provide conditions under which cooperative tariffs and mutual recognition (i.e. the foreign country accepts the standard set by the home country) or fully harmonized standards (i.e. the standard is identical in the home and foreign country) lead to a globally efficient trade agreement.==== This paper adds to this literature in two ways. First, we highlight the parallel effort of standard-setting organizations in achieving convergence on product characteristics through the release of common voluntary product standards. In the aforementioned papers governments mandate changes in the production structure through regulatory compliance. Second, our empirical estimates suggest that firm heterogeneity plays an important role when considering trade policies on product standards. The presence of sunk investment costs implies lower average costs for larger firms and puts smaller firms at a competitive disadvantage.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the standard-setting process and Section 3 presents the theoretical framework that we use to derive the regression specification as well as some empirical implications.

To account for both types of risks, we focus on an economy with incomplete markets, limited commitment, and search frictions in the secondary market for sovereign bonds. We quantify the effect of liquidity on sovereign spreads and welfare by performing quantitative exercises when our model is calibrated to match key features of the Argentinean default in 2001. From a positive point of view, we find (a) that a substantial portion of sovereign spreads is due to a liquidity premium, and (b) the liquidity premium helps to resolve the “credit spread puzzle” by generating high average spreads while maintaining a low default frequency.

One friction that prevents the smoothing of expenses over time and states of nature is governments’ inability to commit to future debt and default policies. This lack of commitment implies that the government will repay its debts only if it is convenient to do so and will dilute debt holders whenever it sees fit. To compensate investors for bearing these risks, the sovereign pays a default or ==== which increases borrowing costs, especially during bad times. The sovereign debt literature has helped us to understand how a lack of commitment shapes the outcomes of sovereign countries from a positive point of view and what policies are desirable from a normative point of view.====The recent European debt crisis has, however, highlighted the importance of decentralized markets in imposing additional frictions that prevent smoothing by sovereign countries.==== Sovereign bonds are traded in over-the-counter markets where trading is infrequent. In such a setting, it takes time for a sovereign bond holder to find a counterparty that is willing to trade at a fair price, especially if the bond holder has a large position. For this reason, investors need to be compensated not only for the risk of default or dilution, but also for illiquidity. This introduces an additional ==== which further increases borrowing costs and constrains sovereign policies. So far, the literature has been silent about this feature of sovereign borrowing. Our objective is to fill this gap by answering the following questions. How do credit and liquidity premiums interact? What portions of total spreads can be explained by credit and by liquidity? What are the welfare gains from reducing frictions in the secondary market?====Our paper contributes to the literature on sovereign borrowing in two ways. First, we propose a tractable model of sovereign borrowing in which credit and liquidity premia jointly determine borrowing and default decisions. Second, in a quantitative exploration focusing on one of the most studied cases of sovereign default—Argentina's default in 2001—we show that the liquidity premium is a substantial component of total spreads. The liquidity premium therefore helps to rationalize the “credit spread puzzle” by simultaneously generating high credit spreads and a low default frequency. Furthermore, we show that, through the lens of our model, the welfare gains from eliminating liquidity frictions are of the same order of magnitude as the gains from eliminating income fluctuations.====We begin by constructing a model of sovereign debt where debt and default policies take into account credit and liquidity risks. We focus on a small open economy that borrows from international investors to smooth income shocks following the quantitative sovereign debt literature that builds on Eaton and Gersovitz (1981). A benevolent government issues non-contingent long-term debt and chooses debt and default policies to maximize household utility. The government cannot commit to future debt and default policies and might default in some states of nature. The novel feature in our setting is the introduction of search frictions in the secondary market for sovereign bonds which we model following the literature on over-the-counter markets (e.g., Duffie et al. 2005). In our model, investors buy bonds in the primary market and can receive idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. If a liquidity shock occurs, investors bear a cost for holding the bond and therefore become natural sellers. However, due to search frictions in the secondary market, it will take time for sellers to find a counterparty with whom to transact. As a result, bid-ask spreads arise endogenously through the bargaining between investors and dealers in the over-the-counter bond market.====One of the key features of our model is that default and liquidity risks are jointly determined. On the one hand, the presence of search frictions in the secondary market introduces a liquidity risk premium that affects prices in the primary market which, in turn, affects debt and default policies and therefore the credit risk premium. On the other hand, the probability of default increases as the credit risk premium increases, and because investors foresee worse liquidity conditions should a default occur, current liquidity conditions also deteriorate, which, in turn, increase the liquidity risk premium. Therefore, in our model, default and liquidity risk premia are jointly determined. This joint determination enables us to decompose total spreads into liquidity and credit components, and allows us to study the welfare implications of reducing liquidity frictions in the secondary market.====After building a model of sovereign borrowing in which both credit and liquidity premia constrain the choices of the government, we perform quantitative exercises to assess (1) how much of total spreads are due liquidity frictions, and (2) what the welfare gains from eliminating these frictions would be. To do so, we calibrate the model to match key features of Argentina's default in 2001. In particular, we match debt levels, the mean and volatility of spreads, bid-ask spreads, and bond trading turnover to their data counterparts.====Our first quantitative finding is that the liquidity premium is a substantial component of total spreads. For the 1993:I to 2001:IV period, our calibrated model attributes roughly one quarter of the total Argentine sovereign spread to the liquidity premium on average. Furthermore, the liquidity component of total sovereign spreads is time-varying—it is low during good times (when debt levels are low and output is high) and high during bad times. This prediction is consistent with the empirical findings in Bai et al. (2012) and Pelizzon et al. (2016).====A corollary of our first quantitative finding is that accounting for the liquidity component of total spreads helps to resolve the “credit spread puzzle"". Standard sovereign default models fully attribute the sovereign spread to default risk; as a result, a counter-factually high default rate is needed to match the observed levels of sovereign spreads. In contrast, our model attributes a significant portion of the total sovereign spread to liquidity risk and is therefore able to match the mean level of Argentine spreads while simultaneously matching a low annual default frequency of 2.4 percent.====Our second quantitative finding is that the welfare gains from eliminating liquidity frictions are substantial. Using our calibrated model, we find that the welfare gains induced from eliminating secondary market frictions are 0.3 percent in consumption equivalent terms. To put this number in perspective, given the volatility of consumption for Argentina during our period of study, a representative agent in the Lucas (2003) economy would pay 0.4 percent in consumption equivalent terms to eliminate income fluctuations.====The source of variation of the liquidity premium in our model, over time and states of nature, is due to an ====. The intuition for this channel is that a sovereign default results in the deferral of debt repayment, which results in an increase in the expected maturity of outstanding debt in the run up to a default. The latter extension in expected maturity increases the sensitivity of bond prices to liquidity shocks. As a result, investors require a higher compensation for bearing liquidity risk (i.e., a higher liquidity premium) as the default probability increases.====We believe that the distinction between credit and liquidity risk is important for the design of debt policies for at least two reasons. First, in the long run, the policies aimed at mitigating a lack of commitment differ from those designed to address frictions in the secondary market. For example, Hatchondo et al. (2016) and Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2015) show that fiscal rules and covenants on debt improve welfare in models when the government lacks commitment. However, policies that would decrease the liquidity premium in the long run include the development of a centralized exchange for sovereign bond trading or increasing transparency in the secondary market (see, e.g., Edwards et al. 2007). Second, the policies implemented during a short-term crisis might also be different. For example, a government could use resources to repay debt or to bail-out distressed financial institutions that hold government debt. An alternative policy, focusing on the secondary market, would be to provide liquidity to intermediaries.",Illiquidity in sovereign debt markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000502,8 April 2022,2022,Research Article,89.0

We show that bargaining frictions affect prices in these key short-term dollar funding markets. Our identification strategy relies on a number of quasi-experiments, including the US MMF reform and quarter-end window-dressing by European banks. Post-crisis regulations have reduced competition in these markets and have generated incentives for regulatory arbitrage, which affect bargaining power and prices. Our results also highlight substantial heterogeneity across global banks of different nationalities in their behavior in dollar funding markets.","US dollar funding is the lifeblood of international banking. Non-US global banks have a very large footprint in dollar banking despite their restricted access to core dollar deposits and central bank backstops. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, they collectively held $12.6 trillion of dollar denominated assets by the end of 2017 – rivalling those of US banks. Wholesale dollar funding markets in which global banks source dollars were at the forefront during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Both crises, together with post-crisis regulatory reforms, have changed the structure and functioning of these markets.====One of the key sources of wholesale dollar funding for non-US banks is US money market funds (MMFs), through both unsecured and secured funding instruments.==== The essential role of this market for the functioning of global financial intermediation materialized time and again, as stress spilled over to the rest of the financial system during the GFC (Schmidt et al., 2016), the 2011 Eurozone sovereign debt crisis (Chernenko and Sunderam, 2014), as well as the Covid-19 crisis (Eren et al., 2020a).====We show that pricing in this very deep and liquid market for dollar funding is far from competitive, using a detailed security-level dataset of US MMF holdings of secured and unsecured instruments issued by global banks. The richness of our dataset allows us to study the underlying market frictions and identify their effects on prices. Our identification strategy is based on exogenous market disruptions during otherwise tranquil periods, which helps us to avoid the impact of the confounding factors usually present during a crisis.====We first document persistent and significant price dislocations in these wholesale dollar funding markets. Markets for both repos and unsecured instruments are highly concentrated, with the top 5 US MMF fund families taking around 60% of the respective market shares. Price dispersion, even in the secured and highly liquid repo market, can exceed 20 basis points in the cross-section of banks – after controlling for contract and time-varying bank characteristics. These deviations can be more than twice as large for unsecured instruments, including commercial paper (CP), certificates of deposits (CD) and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) – even after relevant risks are accounted for.====We investigate the drivers of this price dispersion and establish the key role of bargaining frictions arising from the over-the-counter (OTC) nature of this market (Duffie et al., 2005). The structure and concentration of the market have implications for the outside options available to both funds and banks. We construct measures of market and bargaining power for funds, fund families and banks and use them to show that MMFs have substantial pricing power. Funds use their relative power to discriminate prices among highly-rated global banks, contributing to the price dispersion observed in the data. Concretely, funds charge higher prices to banks with weaker bargaining positions over and above what credit risk or other contract and bank characteristics can explain.====To establish the causal effect of bargaining power on prices, we devise an identification strategy that utilizes exogenous shocks on both the funding supply (MMFs) and demand (banks) sides, in both secured and unsecured instruments. This allows us to not only identify the effect of bargaining frictions on prices, but also to do so from multiple angles to show that they are a pervasive feature of these key short-term dollar funding markets.====The first part of our identification strategy focuses on the supply side and builds on the US MMF reform implemented in October 2016. This led to important changes in short-term dollar funding markets between US MMFs and global banks. In response to the reform, many fund families converted their prime funds – which can provide both unsecured funding and repos to banks – to government funds that can only provide secured funding in the form of repos against Treasury or agency collateral. The resulting exogenous negative supply shock in the market for unsecured funding reduced the outside options of banks and therefore led to higher market/bargaining power for prime MMFs. Indeed, we show that marginal changes in our measures of market/bargaining power increase the prices that MMFs can charge to a larger extent in the aftermath of the reform. Moreover, these results also suggest an unintended consequence of the US MMF reform, as it led to changes in market structure that exacerbated existing frictions.====We further exploit the fact that while the US MMF reform presented a negative shock to competition for unsecured funding, it had the opposite effect for repo funding. With prime funds converting into government/Treasury funds in response to the reform, banks’ outside options for funding in the repo market improved. Taking into account this effect, we compare the pricing in the unsecured funding and repo markets before and after the reform. In different specifications, we run regressions for all funds and for prime funds only. While we argue that the latter provides sharper identification since prime funds can lend in both markets, our results are similar across all specifications. In line with our hypothesis, reduced outside options in unsecured funding markets led to an increase in the relative bargaining power of funds after the reform. On the flip side, increased outside options for banks in the repo market led to a decrease in the relative bargaining power of funds in this market after the reform.====We then present a complementary strategy that leverages the heterogeneity across global banks, and builds on the structural changes in the demand for dollar funding by global banks that followed the GFC and the implementation of post-crisis banking regulations. Two developments stand out. First, after the GFC, global banks’ dollar business models grew increasingly heterogeneous. European banks reduced their dollar assets and shifted towards shorter-term and more liquid dollar activities, such as short-term arbitrage of interest on excess reserves (IOER) and repo intermediation. Japanese banks, however, substantially expanded their long-term dollar lending and, as a banking system, became the largest dollar borrowers by a substantial margin. As a consequence, Japanese banks’ demand for dollar grew increasingly inelastic relative to that of other banks. Second, leverage ratio regulations under Basel III were implemented inconsistently across jurisdictions. Global banks headquartered in the European Union were allowed to use end-of-period positions to calculate their regulatory leverage ratio, rather than the daily average mandated in other jurisdictions. This allowed European banks to lever up within quarters, only to retreat from repo intermediation at end-of-quarter reporting dates. We exploit both demand-side heterogeneities to further strengthen our identification of the effect of bargaining power on both secured and unsecured funding.====We first show that, following the MMF reform, a marginal increase in the bargaining power of MMFs led to a higher price of unsecured funding for Japanese relative to other banks – consistent with their relatively inelastic demand for dollar funding. This is also in line with other salient developments such as the larger cross-currency basis for the JPY/USD relative to the EUR/USD basis, and the greater demand for central bank swap lines by Japanese banks during the Covid-19 crisis.====Second, we show that the exogenous variation in the implementation of leverage ratio regulation affects pricing. It does so by temporarily reducing the bargaining power of US MMFs vis-á -vis non-EU banks, namely those that need to base their leverage ratio calculations on daily averages and hence have no incentives for quarter-end window-dressing. Non-EU banks generally obtain more favorable pricing at quarter-ends when EU banks withdraw from repo markets. In addition, we also exploit the timing of the implementation of the regulations, as well as the differences between Treasury and other collateral in the context of the overnight reverse repurchase facility of the Federal Reserve, which affects outside options and hence bargaining power.====With a key dollar funding market subject to frictions and structural changes, we investigate possible spill-overs to another key (secured) market for global banks’ dollar funding – the FX swap market. Our results suggest over 65% of the variation in short-term (1-week) USD/JPY FX swap prices at quarter-ends can be explained by the exogenous window-dressing effect in repo markets.","Global banks, dollar funding, and regulation",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000411,25 March 2022,2022,Research Article,90.0

The relationship is stronger for firms with financial constraints, with the use of foreign debt, and in more open economies; it is weaker for firms with derivatives hedging, with higher sales, and in countries with better financial development.","The foreign exchange (FX) market is the largest financial market in the world in terms of trading volume. According to the 2019 tri-annual survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the daily aggregate trading volume in global FX markets is over six trillion dollars.==== Understanding the link between exchange rates and economic fundamentals is at the center of international finance (James et al., 2012; Rossi, 2013); however, strong empirical evidence of the exchange rate-fundamentals connection remains lacking in the literature.==== At the aggregate level, recent studies have documented the adverse effects of foreign exchange uncertainty on economic growth, productivity, and income (Frankel and Rose, 2002; Aghion et al., 2009). At the firm level, excessive exchange rate volatility would increase uncertainty, which unavoidably impacts their operation and investment decisions.====In this paper, we examine the effects of FX volatility on firm-level operations==== from an important yet hitherto ==== perspective: technological innovation.==== The importance of technological innovation in promoting economic growth has been highlighted since the seminal studies of Solow (1957), Kydland and Prescott (1982), Romer, 1986, Romer, 1990, and subsequent empirical studies.==== At the firm level, innovation activities are generally regarded as one of the most critical long-term investments. Different from tangible and physical investments, innovation activities take a longer period to complete and are subject to much higher risk and uncertainty (Holmstrom, 1989; Hall and Lerner, 2010). Research and development (R&D) is an intangible investment that creates patents (and growth options) that determine firms' long-term value, which is different from capital expenditure that scales up firms' current production and contributes to short-term profits (Aghion et al., 2010). Thus, R&D investment tends to be countercyclical, while physical investment tends to be procyclical (Aghion et al., 2012). Moreover, U.S. R&D has grown much faster than traditional physical investment: Skinner (2008) shows that, over the period from 1980 to 2005, U.S. listed firms' total capital expenditures increased by less than 50%, while their total R&D expenditures increased by about 250%; in 2005, their R&D expenditures were more than twice the amount of their capital expenditures.====There is, however, a lack of empirical evidence on the role of international finance on firm-level innovation activities. When prior studies examine the relationship between international trade and technology spillovers, they tend to focus on R&D spillovers (e.g. Fracasso and Marzetti, 2015). Moreover, as international collaboration and trade of technologies have grown rapidly relative to global GDP (Spulber, 2008, Spulber, 2010), it is particularly important to examine the real effect of exchange rate volatility on firms' innovation activities. Thus, whether and how FX volatility influences firm-level R&D investments and patent outputs deserves further investigation.====We argue that FX volatility may deter firm-level innovation activities through two potential economic mechanisms: precautionary savings and trade slowdown. The idea of precautionary savings dates back to Keynes (1936), referring to the increase of cash savings to prepare for future higher uncertainty.==== When FX volatility surges, firms engaging in foreign trading are concerned about their cash holdings for future business operations and may give up valuable investment projects. In comparison with physical investments, innovation activities require long-term investments but their outputs are highly uncertain and are hard to liquidate or collateralize, so that firms may not initiate these innovative projects or will have to abandon them to maintain day-to-day business operations when they are cash or credit constrained (e.g., Bloom and Van Reenen, 2002; Aghion et al., 2010; Aghion et al., 2012). Moreover, such an effect can be amplified by the heightened costs of evaluating innovation projects in difficult times (Kerr and Nanda, 2015).====FX volatility may also increase trade frictions and slow down cross-border trade, which will particularly impact firms and economies that depend on international trade. Kenen and Rodrik (1986) argue that countries with higher short-term exchange rate volatility have lower international trade volume. Also, Aghion et al. (2009) show that a fixed FX regime is more beneficial to economic growth for economies with lower financial development. High-tech or innovative firms, especially those in emerging countries, will tend to be damaged by the slowdown of international trade to a greater extent if their operations rely on international trade and cross-border activities.==== When an economy is more open, it is clearly more vulnerable to FX volatility (Rodrik, 2001), and so the innovation activities of firms in more open economies, compared to more inward-looking or closed economies, are more likely to be affected.====On the other hand, we also acknowledge that FX volatility may promote firm-level innovation activities for two potential reasons. First, under greater economic uncertainty, firms may be motivated to invest more in R&D and innovative projects because these investments help firms better withstand external shocks and competition (Bloom et al., 2016; Hombert and Matray, 2018). Second, due to the lower opportunity costs of innovation investments during recessions, R&D and innovative activities are expected to be countercyclical for firms ==== financial constraints (Aghion et al., 2010; Aghion et al., 2012); thus, when FX volatility drives an economic downturn, we may find a positive relationship between FX volatility and firm-level innovation.====In our empirical analysis, we consider an unbalanced panel of FX-exposed, innovative firms in 32 markets with available FX, financial, and patent data from 1989 to 2018. These firms have sales in foreign markets using different currencies (and therefore are FX-exposed) and have been granted at least one patent in our sample period (and therefore are innovative or patent-active). We measure a firm's innovation activities in a year using the following six variables: R&D expenditure scaled by total assets, log number of patents registered in the home patent office (“domestic patents”), log number of forward citations received by domestic patents (“domestic citations”), log number of patents registered in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) (“US patents”), log number of forward citations received by US patents (“US citations”), and a dummy variable indicating registration of at least one patent.====We construct firm-level exchange rate volatility to exploit the cross-firm, cross-year variation. We first calculate annually realized exchange rate volatility at the market level. Then we use the information about a firm's yearly sales to different markets to construct a weighted average measure of firm-specific FX volatility. This measure absorbs a firm's information concerning the geographical distribution of sales and the market-level FX volatility. This measure can also be viewed as a Bartik-style instrument (Bartik, 1991; Goldsmith-Pinkham et al., 2020; Klepacz, 2021).====Since the explanatory variable is at the firm level, we control for firm fixed effects to absorb the time-invariant firm characteristics. Moreover, we control for market-market-year fixed effects, which are stronger than market-year fixed effects in that not only are the macro factors controlled for as in both fixed effects, but the bilateral factors are also controlled. For example, the trade tensions between two countries are controlled, and the two countries' corresponding policy moves are also controlled.====We find that our FX volatility measure is associated with significant reductions in firm-level innovation activities after we control for firm and market-market-year fixed effects, exchange rate changes (i.e., the mean effect), as well as various firm-level characteristics. This negative relationship is not only statistically significant but also economically sizeable. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in FX volatility is followed by a 7.3% decrease in R&D expenditure ratio, a 2% decrease in the number of domestic patents, a 0.3% decrease in the number of domestic citations, a 7.8% decrease in the number of U.S. patents, a 6.8% decrease in the number of U.S. citations, and a 21.4% decrease in the propensity to file a patent. In addition, a one standard deviation increase in FX volatility is also followed by a 1.7% increase in cash holdings, consistent with the precautionary saving motive. These decreases in innovation output are critical to firm value and growth, as pointed out in Griliches (1981), Harhoff et al. (1999), and Hall et al. (2005). In our robustness checks, we show that our results are unaffected when an alternative GARCH-based measure of FX volatility is employed.====We also explore the impact of FX volatility on other dimensions of innovation activities. We find that FX volatility is negatively associated with patent originality and exploration, while positively related to patent generality and exploitation. These findings suggest that FX volatility discourages long-term investment in innovation projects that are radical and different from firms' existing expertise, which confirms our argument based on risk avoidance. On the other hand, the positive relation with patent generality and exploitation can be attributed to firms' resource-shifting: firms under more volatile FX environments may shift their innovation focus to patent projects that are more general and exploitative because these projects' outputs are of lower uncertainty.====Our further tests provide supportive evidence for the two economic mechanisms (which are not mutually exclusive): precautionary savings needs and trade slowdown. Besides the evidence of the higher cash holdings following an increase in FX volatility, our cross-sectional interaction tests based on financial constraints, firm sales, foreign debt, and market financial development further support the precautionary savings needs interpretation. The negative impact is amplified for firms with higher financial constraints, lower sales, higher foreign debt, and for firms located in less developed financial markets. Higher FX volatility also leads to higher future earnings uncertainty, measured by the cross-sectional dispersion of analysts' forecasts. Therefore, there is strong evidence that firms are indeed concerned about the adverse effects of FX volatility. Our cross-sectional interaction tests based on the use of currency derivatives and the degree of economic openness support the trade slowdown explanation: innovation activities reduce more when firms do not use currency derivatives to hedge FX risk,==== or when firms are in more open economies.====This paper adds new evidence to the literature on the real effects of FX volatility. Existing studies on FX volatility mainly focus on the asset pricing implications.==== The present paper is arguably one of the first to analyze the impact of FX volatility on firm operations. Our analysis of firm-level R&D investment and patent output following FX volatility fills a gap in the economics literature and provides new insights into the exchange rate-fundamentals connection, which lacks empirical evidence in the past (Meese and Rogoff, 1983).==== One potential reason for the “exchange rate-fundamentals disconnect puzzle” could be the inaccurately measured and less frequently updated fundamental variables relative to exchange rates. Our firm-level R&D-based and patent-based variables appropriately reflect innovation inputs and performance in a timely manner, which effectively mitigates the measurement error issue in economic fundamentals.====From a broader perspective, this work is related to the debate on the stability and regulation of foreign exchange rates.==== Given the crucial role of technological innovation in promoting economic growth, our findings imply that one reason for FX volatility to slow down economic growth is through reducing innovation activities and investments.====This paper also provides new evidence for the adverse effects of macroeconomic uncertainty on intangible investments, echoing the implications of Bloom et al. (2007) and Aghion et al. (2010). Our results support the argument of Bloom and Van Reenen (2002) that government policies for reducing macroeconomic uncertainty are important for the accumulation and application of knowledge capital.==== Moreover, different from prior studies that examine how physical investments are influenced by broadly defined economic uncertainty,==== we focus on FX volatility, which is more specific and can thus be more precisely measured.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the datasets and variables used in the empirical analysis. Section 3 presents the test results of the association between FX volatility and firm-level innovation activities. Section 4 discusses the mechanisms through which FX volatility influences firm-level innovation activities.

The intuition is that factor mobility may cushion the effects of regional shocks when conventional stabilization mechanisms are unavailable. But only a few studies formally link labor mobility to macroeconomic adjustment and policy. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap in the literature by studying macroeconomic dynamics and optimal monetary policy in a model economy with cyclical labor flows across distinct regions sharing trade links and a common monetary policy. We ask if, and if so how, the defining feature of labor mobility affects the way monetary policy should be conducted in an ‘optimal currency area’ once it has been created.====We start by setting out a baseline model with endogenous labor mobility in a currency union. The model is an extension of the two-region model used by Benigno (2004) to analyze optimal monetary policy in a currency union without labor mobility. In the extended model, households choose the location for their members in every period to maximize expected utility subject to migration costs. Migrant and native workers then take part in competitive regional labor markets on equal terms. Migration flows are the cause of two additional potential sources of welfare loss in this monetary union compared to a frictionless benchmark. First, the costs associated with migration are wasteful and reduce the scope for consumption. Second, an efficient allocation of aggregate demand for goods across the union's regions will not necessarily guarantee that individuals are allocated to firms efficiently when labor is mobile. An optimizing policymaker therefore generally puts some weight on stabilizing migration flows to balance the benefits of migration as a regional shock-absorber against these costs. However, the common monetary policy holds little sway over migration, and such a policy amounts to fine-tuning. A strict focus on stabilizing unionwide consumer price inflation remains close to optimal in the baseline model with labor mobility. In the special case in which everyone consumes the same bundle of goods regardless of location, migration flows are fully independent of monetary policy. Policymakers can safely ignore migration flows when setting monetary policy in this case.====As these results are derived under strict assumptions about efficiency in regional labor markets, we also investigate the extent to which labor market frictions may interact with interregional migration in a way that complicates the setting of monetary policy in a monetary union. In particular, we further extend our model with search and matching frictions in regional labor markets. The additional frictions introduce a new externality in household migration decisions absent from the model with competitive labor markets. Since households take wages and job finding rates as given – and since individuals are locked into employment contracts once they have been matched to a firm – they effectively take too strong a signal from expected future labor market outcomes when making their migration decision. We show that this inefficiency gives rise to further trade-offs for the common monetary policy authority even when its ability to affect migration flows themselves is limited. Thus, free movement of labor complicates the setting of monetary policy once we consider frictions in regional labor market, requiring the optimizing policymaker to show greater flexibility in inflation targeting. While a strict inflation targeting regime remains close to optimal, migration flows strengthen the case for leaning against labor market imbalances in the monetary union. A simple inflation targeting-rule with a moderate weight on unemployment comes close to minimizing welfare losses in the monetary union, and dominates strict inflation targeting. Finally, labor mobility reduces welfare costs of following suboptimal instrument rules as migration flows help to close inefficiency gaps in regional labor markets. The social benefit to free movement is significant, even when households do not take full account of them when making individual migration decisions.====Our paper follows the previous study of labor mobility in a monetary union by Farhi and Werning (2014). A key result in this seminal paper is that migration may not bring benefits to everyone depending on the source of demand imbalances across the union. While Farhi and Werning (2014) also consider the optimal monetary policy problem, they do so at a high level of abstraction based on a stylized static model. Instead, we solve the policy problem within a fully articulated DSGE framework. Our setup is different to theirs in two key ways. First, even if we allow migrants to take their purchasing power with them to a new region, we abstract from non-tradable goods that may give rise to purely ‘internal’ demand shortfalls in their setup. As migration flows are found to be efficient subject to such shocks (even if welfare only improves for the migrants themselves and not for those who stay behind), there is no need for monetary policy to respond to them beyond the sources of inefficiency that we consider. Second, we maintain the assumption that consumption risk is perfectly shared as is common in the literature on monetary policy in open economies. By doing so, we effectively also abstract from the externality identified by Farhi and Werning (2014) when shocks are ‘external’. The externality implies that there is too little migration in equilibrium as potential migrants do not internalize the benefits to others if they would leave them behind with more aggregate demand, as long as prices remain fixed. As a result, the flexible-price equilibrium is efficient when labor markets are competitive in our model. That makes our model easy to compare with the benchmark monetary union without labor mobility considered by Benigno (2004) under similar assumptions. Moreover, Farhi and Werning (2014) do not seem to find that this migration externality is important for monetary policy. We therefore turn our attention to the effects of frictions originating in labor markets.====The contemporaneous work by Kekre (2021) similarly considers optimal monetary policy in a monetary union with search and matching frictions, but he does not consider the role of labor mobility. The optimal policy analysis, in turn, sets our paper apart from the additional contemporaneous studies by Clemens and Hart, 2018, Clemens and Hart, 2019, Cook et al., 2019 and House et al. (2018). Like us, these authors study macroeconomic dynamics within a monetary union with some form of labor mobility. But they all condition on a simple instrument rule for monetary policy. Hence, their papers shed light on how migration flows form part of macroeconomic adjustments in a monetary union for a given view of how monetary policy might be conducted. We instead study how monetary policy ==== be conducted in a monetary union in which labor is free to migrate across internal borders. Clemens and Hart, 2018, Clemens and Hart, 2019 and House et al. (2018) further provide evidence that migration varies over the business cycle in the euro area as well as the United States in response to relative labor market performance, confirming similar findings in Saks and Wozniak, 2011, Lkhagvasuren, 2012 and Lewis and Swannel (2018). Moreover, House et al. (2018) and Cook et al. (2019) study the effect of the degree of labor mobility on the cost of forming a monetary union for a given specification of monetary policy.====With our normative focus, we contribute to active strands of the literature on optimal monetary policy in monetary unions (building on the work of Benigno, 2004), in economies with frictional labor markets (Blanchard and Galí, 2010, Thomas, 2008, Ravenna and Walsh, 2011), and combining both of these elements (Cacciatore et al., 2016, Eggertsson et al., 2014). More broadly, the paper relates to a growing literature on the role of international migration in macroeconomic adjustments. For example Hauser, 2014, Mandelman and Zanetti, 2014, Smith and Thoenissen, 2018 and Furlanetto and Robstad (2019) consider various sources of cyclical migration flows, while Bandeira et al. (2018) and Battisti et al. (2018) investigate the interplay between fiscal consolidations and migration.====Finally, we note that our model of interregional labor mobility in a monetary union can be reinterpreted as a model of sectoral labor mobility in a closed economy. As such it contributes to an active literature on monetary policy in multi-sector economies in the tradition of Aoki (2001), see e.g. Pasten et al. (2020). In particular, the analysis applies equally well to the question of how monetary policy should behave in the face of sectoral reallocations following shocks with uneven effects across the economy as analysed by Guerrieri et al. (2021). From this perspective, our simple model provides a benchmark for which a tradeoff between activity in different sectors of the economy is optimally resolved by stabilizing aggregate inflation, while labor market frictions may justify flexibility in inflation targeting.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple model economy with competitive regional labor markets in a monetary union, and our baseline calibration based on data and empirical results from the United States. In Section 3 we study the optimal monetary policy problem. We derive a welfare-theoretic loss function, characterize optimal monetary policy, and compare dynamics and welfare under alternative monetary policy regimes. In Section 4, we present the extended model with search and matching frictions in regional labor markets, we describe the calibration of this version of the model, and we characterize the efficient equilibrium and sources of inefficiency. Section 5 then turns to the implications for monetary policy of the interaction of these labor market frictions with internal migration. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",Labor mobility in a monetary union,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000320,11 March 2022,2022,Research Article,92.0

Using transaction-type information of German services traders, we inform the model about key behavioral parameters governing the activity of services producers. We calibrate market-entry costs by sector and market, and decompose these into observable and unobservable components. We then study the effects of de-liberalizing ====. Overall costs on seller-to-customer-market transactions in services are reduced substantially by preferential market access for services through trade agreements. If all countries abandoned existing preferential market access to services, this would reduce their real consumption by up to 6.7% with a similar decline in ==== and dividends (depending on the country). For most economies, depending on their input-output structure, de-liberalizing preferential services-market access has adverse ==== on manufacturing.","While services transactions account for the lion's share of economic activity in developed economies, and such transactions often cross national borders, many quantitative open-economy models portray countries to produce manufacturing goods only (see, e.g., Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003, Costinot et al., 2012), or services to be non-tradable (see, e.g., Eaton and Kortum, 2002). One consequence of this practice is that we know much less about key parameters governing quantitative responses of the services sector than about those of manufacturing. For example, there is a wealth of results on the so-called trade elasticity (with all its different theory-dependent interpretations) for goods (see Broda and Weinstein, 2006, Kee et al., 2008, Kee et al., 2009). The latter calls for price- or ad-valorem-trade-cost data at the country or country-product level, which is abundant for goods but not services. In recent open-economy models of the firm, new key parameters, e.g. those governing the efficiency distribution of firms, co-determine general equilibrium (see Melitz, 2003, or Eaton et al., 2011). Again, information on those parameters is by now relatively abundant for manufacturers but still relatively scarce for services providers. Overall, a data-informed parametrization of modern open-economy models of trade with an emphasis on services production has been infeasible until recently, as high-quality data on services-producing firms and their trade have become available only in the past few years. The present paper analyzes census-type data on services producers and traders in Germany, which is one of the most important open economies in the world. We contribute to the literature by informing a quantifiable multi-sector-multi-country model of goods and services production and consumption, which allows us to calibrate overall (variable and fixed) costs to market-specific sales in a sector, and decomposing these costs into observable and unobservable components. The model features sector-specific markups, market-penetration and productivity-distribution parameters, as well as overall (variable and fixed) country-pair-sector-specific transaction costs. While variants of such a structural analysis have been undertaken for manufacturing firms and their trade (see, e.g., Eaton et al., 2011), we believe that the present paper is among the first ones to conduct a micro-data-guided structural quantitative analysis of services suppliers and their trade.====All of the fundamental parameters are estimated and calibrated on the basis of three datasets: one pertaining to transaction-level data of services exports of firms in Germany; one pertaining to overall sales of manufactures and services of firms in Germany; and one pertaining to input-output relationships for multiple countries and sectors (the World Input–Output Database; see Timmer et al., 2015, Timmer et al., 2016).====The transaction-level data suggest that the (export) sales distribution of services is not Pareto, and that matching the data requires allowing for sector-destination-country-specific shape parameters of a Pareto distribution (involving a single shape and truncation parameter) of firms’ productivity levels as well as of an imperfect market penetration across firms. We find that the corresponding parametrization is able to capture the distribution of sales across sectors quite well. Moreover, the data suggest that the variance of (normalized) overall transaction costs differs substantially across the considered service-sector aggregates, being largest for Construction Services. Across all considered sectors, the role of geographical distance is relatively minor for overall transaction costs, while preferential services-market access through trade agreements reduces transaction costs substantially. Hence, the distance equivalent to preferential services-market access is large.====We proceed by using the partial effects of preferential market access on services transaction costs to study the exit from preferential services trade agreements by all covered countries jointly. The corresponding findings suggest that such deliberalizations lead to smaller adverse effects for larger, and to larger adverse effects for smaller economies on average, akin to goods-trade de-liberalizations. There is a tendency for the effects to be somewhat smaller with preferential services-trade deliberalization in comparison to goods-trade deliberalizations (see Caliendo and Parro, 2015, for the latter). This finding is probably owed to the more shallow liberalization of otherwise more impeded services trade and sales in general relative to the ones in manufacturing. The effects on real wages and dividends are quantified at a similar magnitude, and negative effects are found even for manufactures, on average, in spite of keeping the policy environment unchanged for the latter sector. The latter is owed to the input-output linkages between manufacturing and services, which make liberalization and de-liberalization effects travel across sectoral borders.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Using farm-level data from Colombia, we document two empirical patterns about the spatial organization of agriculture. First, across municipalities, better access to urban centers increases farmers’ productivity and participation in non-local markets, but reduces farm size. Second, within municipalities and crop-choices, larger farms participate more in non-local markets and have higher productivity. To rationalize these patterns, we introduce farmers with heterogeneous productivity and market participation choices into a spatial economy model. We take the model to data and find that removing the geographic barriers to farmers’ participation in non-local markets can increase Colombia's agricultural value added by up to 14%. Changes in the productivity composition of farmers contribute substantially to this impact, particularly in remote regions with low participation of farmers in non-local markets.","There are significant gaps in aggregate agricultural productivity between developing and developed countries. In developing countries, a large share of the population works in low-productivity farming, typically producing for subsistence or selling their produce at local markets. This aggregate figure, however, masks rich differences in farmers’ market participation and productivity across regions within these countries. In some regions, farmers are highly productive and succeed in selling their produce to regional and external markets, despite the low aggregate agricultural productivity in their country. Understanding why some high-productive farmers participate in non-local markets, while others remain in subsistence farming, has long been a major question in academic and policy circles.====Recent research has contributed to this debate by studying how crop-specialization and comparative advantage drive the regional differences in agricultural productivity.==== In this paper, we examine a different driver of these regional differences: the selection of heterogeneous farmers into non-local markets, such as regional urban centers or international markets. Based on insights from research in trade and firm heterogeneity building on Melitz (2003), we study how differences in market access within a country shapes farmers’ market participation and agricultural productivity.====Our empirical setting is based on a rich agricultural census that includes the universe of farms from Colombia in 2014. For different reasons, Colombia provides an ideal empirical setting for our study. In addition to being an important global agricultural producer, this is a large country with several medium-sized urban centers—the type of location that hosts the majority of consumers of farmers’ produce and from which farmers access major distribution centers. Due to its hilly geography and poor transportation infrastructure, domestic trade costs are sizable in Colombia.==== As such, there is large variation across regions in terms of farmers’ access to urban centers. Furthermore, many urban centers in Colombia have emerged because of historical reasons that are unrelated to its modern agricultural sector, an institutional feature that we exploit in our empirical analysis.====We start our analysis by documenting two new empirical patterns about the spatial structure of agricultural production. First, we show that proximity to urban centers increases farm productivity and farmers participation in non-local markets, but reduces the average size of farm in terms of land use. These relationships are large in magnitude and robust to a comprehensive set of geographic controls and to instrumental variable estimation, in which we exploit historical determinants of the location of urban centers. Second, using the farm-level structure of our data, we show that, when we compare farmers producing the same crop within the same municipality, participation in non-local markets and farm productivity increase with farm-size, and farmers participating in non-local markets have higher farm productivity.====To rationalize these empirical patterns, we introduce farmers with heterogeneous productivity and market participation choices into a spatial economy model. We consider a small open economy model with multiple regions. Farmers can produce one of two varieties of agricultural goods: a conventional one, which they can sell locally, and an exportable one, which they can sell to consumers in large urban centers (or abroad). The exportable variety comes with a price premium, but its production requires the payment of a fixed cost. This fixed cost captures, for example, the additional costs related to logistic activities, packaging, or the application of special types of agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers and pesticides) that are required for sales to consumers in large urban centers.==== Individuals in the rural economy have heterogeneous location preferences and heterogeneous farm management ability. Based on their preferences and abilities, they choose in which region they live and whether to become a worker, a farmer that produces the conventional variety, or a farmer that produces the exportable one.====Consistent with the empirical patterns that we find between municipalities, our model predicts that an increase in market access increases average farm productivity in a region. This occurs because farmers with higher ability expand their operations and become producers of exportable varieties of agricultural goods, crowding out low-productivity farmers producing conventional varieties, who then become agricultural farmworkers. Furthermore, consistent with the empirical patterns within municipalities, our model predicts that high-ability farmers overcome the fixed cost of producing exportable varieties, have larger farms, and have higher farm productivity. In addition to rationalizing these empirical patterns, our model provides tractable expressions that highlight the different mechanisms determining the agricultural value added per capita in a region. Specifically, we show that the agricultural value added per capita can be broken down into a term related to the role of natural advantages, a term capturing the selection of farmers into non-local markets, and a term associated with congestion forces—specifically, the ratio of land to labor—which captures the endogenous responses in the model generated by changes in location choices.====We quantify our model to gauge the quantitative importance of the new mechanism in our analysis, that is, the selection of heterogeneous farmers into non-local markets. We calibrate our model so that it achieves, for each municipality, a perfect fit with data in terms of the average farm productivity, the share of farmers participating in non-local markets, and the average farm size. We adjust the price premium of exportable varieties of agricultural goods in each municipality based on the share of farmers participating in non-local markets, and we calibrate the dispersion of farming ability according to the empirical productivity gap between farmers participating in non-local markets and the remaining farmers.====We then perform two counterfactual exercises to study the role of geographic barriers to farmers’ market participation, as captured by the spatial differences in the price premia for exportable varieties. In the first counterfactual, we focus on the differences in price premia that exists ==== catchment areas of urban centers. In particular, we remove the impact of distance to the nearest urban center on the price premium received by farmers in each catchment area. In the second counterfactual, we focus on differences in the price premia ==== catchment areas. In that case, we increase ==== the price premia in all municipalities of each catchment area as to match the average premia in the catchment area with the highest average price premia.====In each counterfactual, we study the effects of changes in the price premia on agricultural value added. To isolate the influence of the endogenous mechanisms in our model, we proceed in three steps. First, we evaluate the impact of changes in the price premia holding farmers’ location and market participation choices fixed. This first step holds constant the productivity composition of farmers. Second, we allow farmers to re-optimize their market participation choices, which unlocks the impact of the selection mechanism. Third, we allow individuals to re-optimize their location choices. We find that, in the absence of any re-optimization, the reduction in the geographic differences of the price premia increases Colombia's value by 12.6%. Allowing farmers to change their market participation choices increases this impact by 9%, and allowing famers to change both their location and market participation choices increases this impact by 10%, resulting in a final increase in Colombian's agricultural value added of 13.92%. Importantly, the role of the selection mechanism is substantially heterogeneous across regions: in the 10% more isolated regions, the selection mechanism magnifies the impact of the changes in price premia by at least 19%.====To close our analysis, we evaluate the importance of the mechanisms in our model from a public policy perspective. Specifically, we use our model to examine the impact of an infrastructure plan under implementation in the northeast of Colombia called the “La Ruta del Cacao”. We find that considering the endogenous selection of farmers in non-local markets can substantially affect the cost and benefit analysis of this plan.====This paper relates to growing research on trade and agriculture, including Costinot and Donaldson, 2014, Costinot et al., 2016, Donaldson, 2018, Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2016, Sotelo, 2020, Tombe, 2015, Pellegrina, 2022, Fajgelbaum and Redding, 2014, Allen and Atkin, 2015, Allen, 2014, Dhingra and Tenreyro, 2017, and Porteous (2016)—among many others. This literature has studied several different mechanisms through which crop-specialization and comparative advantage leads to productivity gains. One exception closer to our paper is Dhingra and Tenreyro (2017), who develop a model with exogenous farm size distribution and fixed cost of selling to external markets to study the market power of agricultural trading firms. Our key contribution to this literature is to introduce endogenous farm size distribution to evaluate how it shapes agricultural productivity.====By focusing on the relationship between agricultural productivity and farmers’ heterogeneity, our paper relates to a rich literature on trade and firm heterogeneity—in our case, farms—building on Melitz (2003), such as Chaney, 2008, Eaton et al., 2011, Arkolakis, 2010, and Pavcnik (2002). (See Bernard et al., 2007 for a review.) The empirical facts that we present for the agricultural sector echo several findings in this literature. For example, we show that distance to urban centers increases the probability of zero sales to non-local markets, which speaks to Baldwin and Harrigan (2011) and Manova (2012), who study the various determinants of zero exports in the manufacturing sector. In addition, we find a substantial productivity premium for exporting farms, which relates to the empirical facts about firm size and export premium documented in Bernard et al. (2007). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show the existence of such parallels between farmers’ patterns of production and the empirical literature on trade and firm heterogeneity.====We complement recent studies that examine how the internal geography of a country shapes its market integration, particularly Fajgelbaum and Redding, 2014, Cosar and Fajgelbaum, 2016, and Sotelo (2020). Here, we add firm heterogeneity to the spatial structure of the models proposed in these papers.==== By doing so, our model speaks to the robust relationships that we uncover in the Colombian data between farm size, farmers’ market participation and market access, which previous models in this literature are unable to generate, since they abstract from the concept of a farm.====This paper also contributes to research in development economics studying transaction costs and farmers’ market participation, such as Gollin and Rogerson, 2014, Key et al., 2000, Goetz, 1992 and Omamo (1998). Closer to this paper, Key et al. (2000) study supply responses in agriculture when some farmers are in autarky due to large transactions costs, and Gollin and Rogerson (2014) study how domestic trade cost generate regions that specialize in subsistence crops instead of cash crops. Different from these papers, we examine how barriers to farmers’ market participation shape aggregate agricultural productivity through the productivity composition of farmers. By focusing on farm heterogeneity, our paper relates to the literature in development economics on farm size and agricultural productivity, such as Adamopoulos and Restuccia, 2020, Adamopoulos and Restuccia, 2014 and Foster and Rosenzweig (2022).==== Different from our paper, these studies abstract from the role of market access. Here, we show that market access can be an important driver of the empirical relationships between farm size and measured farm productivity.====Lastly, our empirical strategy is inspired by papers in economic geography exploiting historical geographic features to evaluate the effects of transportation infrastructure, such as Duranton and Turner, 2012, Duranton et al., 2014, Michaels, 2008, Baum-Snow, 2007, Cosar and Demir, 2016, Duranton, 2015, Baum-Snow et al., 2017, and Faber (2014). This literature has focused on the reduced-form effects of access to markets. As in Donaldson (2018) and Fajgelbaum and Redding (2014), we combine reduced-form estimates with a structural model to evaluate specific mechanisms shaping aggregate productivity.====This paper proceeds as follows. The next section presents the context of our study and our data. Section 3 documents two empirical facts about farm productivity, farmers’ market participation, farm size, and distance to urban centers. Section 4 presents our model. Section 5 describes the calibration and our counterfactual experiments. We conclude in Section 6.","Trade, farmers’ heterogeneity, and agricultural productivity: Evidence from Colombia",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000307,23 February 2022,2022,Research Article,94.0

Firms must therefore engage in a costly search process to find business partners. Online platforms can reduce these search costs and thereby favor firms’ overall exports. We examine whether this is actually the case and the underlying mechanisms thereof. In so doing, we combine detailed information on firms’ participation in a free, purely informational online platform and customs data covering the entire universe of a developing country's export transactions over a long time period. We apply various estimation strategies on these data, including specifically the use of how many visits firms received to their profiles as a source of identifying variation. Consistent with its interpretation as a search cost-reducing mechanism, our estimates suggest that joining the platform resulted in increased firms’ total exports, particularly of those firms that are small or had no digital presence, of differentiated products, and to less familiar destinations.","Information is often incomplete.==== This is especially the case in international trade. Firms that trade across borders must engage in a search process to acquire information about prevailing conditions in foreign markets and specifically to find and assess potential business partners (see Allen, 2014, Rangan and Lawrence, 1999).==== Evidence suggests that search costs are large.==== For instance, these costs have been found to be more than US$ 50,000 for non-exporting firms wishing to ensure one potential client per year and to account for more than 90% of the empirical gravity relationship between trade flows and shipping distance (see Eaton et al., 2014, Allen, 2014). Firms consistently report that identifying the initial business contact and establishing the initial dialogue with prospective partners are perceived as major trade barriers.==== This is particularly important for developing countries, where access to information technologies is limited and where firms are overwhelmingly small (see Startz, 2018).====With the rise of the digital economy, an increasing share of these interactions between firms and with their consumers is taking place via online platforms (see UNCTAD, 2019). These platforms connect different sides of markets and, in their transactional variants, encompass payment processing and delivery arrangements to materialize exchanges between the respective parties. This is the case with well-known e-commerce platforms such as ====, ====, ====, or ====. These platforms therefore represent laboratories to investigate whether and, if so, how digitalization affects international trade by transforming the way firms interact with each other.====In this paper, we examine and provide direct evidence on whether, to what extent, and how the introduction of an online business platform that increases firms’ visibility can reduce search and matching costs and thus favor firms’ exports. We specifically address three main questions: What are the effects of using online platforms on firms’ exports? What are the mechanisms and specifically the role of exporters and importers behind the observed effects? To what extent are these effects heterogeneous?====To answer these questions, we combine and use, for the first time to our knowledge, detailed data on both firms’ participation in the platform and their export activities as reported to the national customs. In particular, we focus on ====, an online business platform that has been explicitly established to foster cross-country trade. As of December of 2018, this platform connected more than 45,000 firms from 140 countries. We estimate the effects of using it on Peruvian firms’ exports. The reason for choosing this country is twofold. First, as we shall show and discuss below, the number of Peruvian firms operating with ==== is relatively large, which helps ensure the possibility to control in a granular way for multiple confounding factors and still have enough statistical power. Second, we have access to the universe of export transactions of Peruvian firms for the period 2010–2018 along with detailed firm-level data on location, sector affiliation, and year of establishment, among other relevant characteristics.====This setting allows us to overcome two important challenges faced when using online platforms to study the effects of reductions in search frictions on firms’ trade. First, platforms typically facilitate both matchmaking, as they reduce search costs for exporters and importers, and completing transactions, as they also lower non-informational payment and logistics costs. These costs are different in nature and have different research and policy implications (see Allen, 2014). We can distinguish between these costs because, unlike most of its counterparts, ==== is a purely informational platform in which direct transactions between firms are not enabled.====Second, the identity of parties operating in platforms is largely unknown to researchers, which complicates the identification of the impact of interest. In particular, it is difficult to establish: (i) who is participating and who is not participating based on data outside of the platform; (ii) whether participants are firms or consumers and whether the former are small or large; (iii) the whole picture of their trade activities both inside and outside of the platform. Differentiating between participants and non-participants in the platforms and knowing their total exports is crucial to determine: (i) whether and to what extent these platforms create trade for the firms and the country instead of merely leading to a substitution between platform-based and non-platform trade and (ii) the underlying mechanisms and whether there is heterogeneity in the potential impacts. Our data enable us to accurately single out which firms are using the platform and compare their overall export performance before and after signing up on the platform and across firms with different levels of exposure to foreign businesses.====Taking advantage of this setting, we start by applying a difference-in-differences strategy on firm-product-destination-semester-year level data. This allows us both to precisely exploit the registration timing and to account in a granular way for multiple potential unobserved confounders including time-invariant firm-product-destination, and time-varying firm and product-destination specific factors through fixed effects.====Our results suggest that the use of the online business platform has resulted in greater firms’ exports. On average, export values increase 17% in response to joining the platform. Given that the median firm-product-destination export value for the last semester of our sample period was US$ 3850, this estimate would imply around US$ 655 additional exports as a result of participating in ====. This increase in exports can be mainly traced back to an expansion of the volumes without changes in unit values and appears to be primarily driven by an improved firm visibility.====Admittedly, even though our high dimensional fixed effects go a long way in absorbing factors that could lead to firms’ self-selection into the platform and simultaneity, the baseline specification cannot entirely rule these identification threats out.==== We therefore perform a number of robustness checks. First, we conduct an event study and a series of placebo tests. Consistent with a causal interpretation of our initial findings, these checks reveal positive and significant effects only after the firms joined the platform and no effects before they did so.====Second, we resort to our detailed platform data and use foreign buying firms’ activities in ==== as the main identifying variation, as opposed to relying on what Peruvian firms do. To be more precise, we allow the impact to differ depending on whether or not firms’ profiles received visits from firms in other countries. The estimated effect is only positive and significant for Peruvian firms whose profiles were actually visited regardless of whether they actively connected to the platform or not. In addition, we go a step further and use destination-specific visits to firms’ profile in order to identify the impact of ====. More specifically, we restrict the estimating sample to those firms that are part of the platform and compare firms’ export responses depending on whether their profiles received visits from firms in the destination of the trade flows. Estimates indicate that Peruvian firms whose profiles were visited experienced export gains even when they do not actively use the platform to look for business opportunities or make dedicated efforts to increase their visibility therein.====Third, we explicitly assess the information cost mechanism. If these costs are the source of observed impacts, then we would expect the size of the impacts to vary with the level of these costs. We accordingly examine whether the effects are heterogeneous across different types of firms, destinations, and products in a manner that is consistent with the severity of information incompleteness along these dimensions. Even though they are not significantly different across all these groups, evidence suggests that impacts are pronounced for firms that are small or lack their own website or media accounts, particularly in more distant and developed destinations, and for differentiated consumer products. Overall, these results reveal that, to a substantial extent, the baseline effects are explained by a higher visibility of exporters through the creation of a digital presence, which helps them become more noticeable to buyers from countries and in products subject to higher information frictions. Finally, we explore the existence of potential general equilibrium effects and the implications for our estimates. Findings from this exploration suggest that the platform has led to net trade creation.====Our study contributes to two main strands of literature. First, we add to a series of papers exploring the effects of information and search frictions on international trade (see, e.g. Rauch, 1999, Rauch and Watson, 2003, Allen, 2014, Chaney, 2014, Eaton et al., 2014, Startz, 2018).==== Most papers in this literature focus on one-sided searches, i.e., either the sellers or the buyers proactively search while the other side remains entirely passive (see Bernard and Moxnes, 2018). An exception in this regard is Eaton et al. (2016), in whose theoretical model both exporting producers and importing retailers search for partners.==== Their paper also highlights that search costs are large and reducing them can lead to substantial welfare gains.====We extend this literature by empirically examining whether and how digital platforms affect search frictions and search efforts and thereby firms’ export outcomes. In so doing, we explicitly investigate the role of both domestic exporting firms and foreign importing firms in these searches and the associated effects thereof.====Second, we complement a number of papers that examine the implications of technologies that can facilitate searching and matching among buyers and sellers and thus reduce their implied costs.====Information and communication technologies, in general, and the internet, in particular, have been shown to reduce price dispersion and favor international trade (see, e.g., Freund and Weinhold, 2002, Freund and Weinhold, 2004, Jensen, 2007, Aker, 2010, Kneller and Timmis, 2016, Steinwender, 2018, Juhász and Steinwender, 2019, Hjort and Poulsen, 2019, Akerman et al., 2019, Fernandes et al., 2019).====More specifically, online consumer-to-consumer (C2C) or business-to-consumer (B2C) platforms can help reduce search costs over space and, in particular, the negative effect of distance-related information frictions on trade relative to the offline scenario. This is precisely what Hortaçsu et al. (2009), Lendle et al. (2016), and Lendle and Vézina (2015) find using within-country data from eBay for the US and from ==== for some Latin American countries, and cross-country data also from eBay, respectively.==== Exploiting the introduction of eBay's global shipping program through both an initial random pilot and its later gradual rollout across importing countries, Hui (2016) shows that the trade-increasing effect of this online platform is strengthened when customs clearance and international shipping and handling services are included. Brynjolfsson et al. (2019) highlight that this is also the case when these platforms are complemented with artificial intelligence-based machine translation systems. Specifically, these systems are associated with increased platform sales, especially of more differentiated products and for less experienced buyers.====Chen and Wu (2021) make use of the fact that online platforms such as ==== allow buyers to share information on exporters’ quality to shed light on the value of reputation.==== Using China's T-shirt exports on this platform, they observe that better reputation based on ratings and the substance of comments translates into larger export revenues, export volumes, and number of destinations and buyers. Finally, combining data from ==== and self-collected objective quality measures, Bai et al. (2020) show that firms with larger past sales have an advantage in overcoming these frictions. Hence, initial demand shocks could confound firms’ quality in determining firms’ growth and the long-run market structure.====In general, firm-level evidence is scarce in this literature. When available, either firms’ use of the technology/platform or their detailed export data from customs is observed, but typically not both, or the data is restricted to trade in transactional online platforms. As discussed above, this creates several methodological challenges since these platforms reduce both search frictions and transaction costs and it is unknown either whether firms or consumers are using them or whether they are pure online exporters or mixed ones. Unlike previous papers, we focus on an online platform that strictly connects firms (B2B) and excludes payment and logistic components. Furthermore, we observe both the complete platform and customs data, which allows us to clearly measure which firms are using the platform and which not, and track their complete export history using the entire universe of a country's exporting firms, even before the creation of the platform. Hence, in principle, we are able to identify in a cleaner way the effects of reductions in information costs in general, and of acquiring knowledge about foreign markets and of searching and directly matching with buying firms in particular.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the online business platform ==== in general and in Peru specifically, describes the dataset, and provides descriptive statistics. Section 3 explains the empirical strategy.

This approach provides an incomplete assessment of how U.S. monetary policy actions spill over to foreign economies, however, because these policy actions do not occur in a vacuum, but usually represent responses to macroeconomic shocks. Depending on the type of shocks prompting Fed actions, the spillovers may differ. Thus, what appears to be bad news for EMEs—that is, a rise in U.S. interest rates—might not be so bad, depending on why the rise in interest rates occurred.====Starting from the framework of a standard Taylor rule, we can envisage three distinct reasons why the Fed might raise its policy interest rate. This could reflect, first, a hawkish shift in the Fed's reaction function, that is, a pure monetary policy shock. Such a development would likely tighten financial conditions—through higher interest rates on safe assets as well as higher risk premia—and weigh on economic activity abroad: Higher U.S. interest rates would tend to weaken the U.S. economy and thus reduce its imports from its trading partners, including many export-dependent EMEs. Moreover, higher U.S. interest rates would translate into higher interest rates and debt-service costs abroad, further weighing on spending, profits, growth, and creditworthiness. Indeed, a growing body of literature emphasizes that such spillovers may take place through credit and risk-taking channels of monetary policy (see Bruno and Shin, 2015a, Bruno and Shin, 2015b, and Kalemli-Ӧzcan, 2019, among others). Thus, the effects of higher U.S. interest rates in this case may be amplified for EMEs, whose assets are perceived to be especially risky and thus likely to depreciate when risk premia widen. Second, a rise in policy rates could reflect a positive shock to inflation, a key variable in the reaction function; as in the case of the “hawkish shift,” this would likely also tighten financial conditions and dampen economic activity abroad. Third, higher U.S. interest rates could be driven by stronger economic activity, the other key variable in the reaction function. In this case, they would be expected to weigh less on foreign financial assets, as negative spillovers from higher interest rates would be at least partly offset by positive spillovers from higher U.S. growth and imports; additionally, a more favorable growth environment would likely moderate any widening of risk premia caused by the higher interest rates, reducing spillovers through the financial channels referenced above.====Our paper seeks to test these conjectures by analyzing the effects on EME asset prices of changes in U.S. interest rates driven by these different types of shocks. For convenience, let us define shocks to the Fed's reaction function and shocks to interest rates prompted by concerns about higher inflation as “monetary shocks,” since they are both conjectured to have similar effects on EMEs. And let us define changes to policy interest rates made in response to changes in the outlook for economic activity as “growth shocks.”==== Thus, we seek to determine whether U.S. monetary shocks have different effects on EMEs than U.S. growth shocks.====To identify these different types of shocks, we employ an event-study approach, focusing on how the path of expected short-term interest rates, measured by the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield, responds to FOMC policy announcements and U.S. employment-report releases. Using changes in asset prices measured during relatively short time windows, so as to minimize endogeneity and omitted variable problems, is a well-established method of identifying monetary policy shocks that dates back to Kuttner (2001). Recent research into the information effects of central bank communications (see, for example, Cieslak and Schrimpf, 2019, and Jarociński and Karadi, 2020) extends this approach by using prices from multiple asset classes to identify different types of shocks. Following on this research, we infer the implications of FOMC announcements or employment-report releases by examining the co-movement of the 2-year yield (an indicator of expected monetary policy) and U.S. equity prices (an indicator of expected U.S. economic growth, once yields are controlled for) in a narrow window around these events.====Consider, for example, an FOMC announcement leading to both a rise in interest rates and a rise in equity prices. This could occur if market participants interpreted the FOMC's move as signaling that it saw greater strength in the economy than private forecasters had previously judged, and this could lead markets to push stock prices upward—we categorize this event as a growth shock. Conversely, a post-FOMC rise in interest rates that was accompanied by a fall in equity prices would more likely reflect a monetary shock: markets would have interpreted the rise in interest rates as reflecting a hawkish shift or inflation fears, either of which would have pushed real discount rates higher and led investors to downgrade their expectations for growth and push stock prices downward. This decline in stock prices would likely also reflect the higher risk premia demanded by investors in the context of rising interest rates and a weaker economic outlook. Similar reasoning applies to the case of employment reports.====Thus, we categorize all events where interest rates and equity prices move in the same direction, whether following FOMC announcements or employment reports, as growth shocks, and all events where they move in opposite directions as monetary shocks. We then compare the response of EME asset prices—exchange rates, CDS spreads, local currency bond yields and equity prices—to these different shocks. In particular, we estimate panel regressions of changes in EME asset prices around FOMC announcements or employment releases on changes in the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield.====Finally, some studies find that EMEs with greater financial and macroeconomic vulnerabilities display greater sensitivity to U.S. monetary and financial developments (see, among others, Ahmed et al., 2017). Is this sensitivity more apparent for monetary or growth shocks? To address this question, we estimate panel regressions that include interactions between changes in U.S. interest rates and measures of the fundamental vulnerability of each EME in the sample.====Our key findings are as follows. First, EME asset prices generally decline less in response to rises in U.S. interest rates associated with employment releases than those associated with FOMC announcements. This result is consistent with the idea that, ====, FOMC events in our sample convey monetary news while employment reports convey growth news. Second, the difference between EME asset price responses to identified monetary and growth shocks is even more pronounced. Currencies, CDS spreads, and equities exhibit weak responses to increases in U.S. interest rates stemming from growth shocks – whether associated with FOMC announcements or employment releases – but large and significant responses to higher rates stemming from monetary shocks. Third, when we divide monetary shocks into those pertaining to shifts in reaction functions and those pertaining to inflation shocks, the latter appear to exert stronger spillovers to EMEs, although differences are not statistically significant. Finally, increases in an EME's macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities make its asset prices more sensitive to U.S. rate surprises, and this interaction effect generally appears to be stronger for monetary shocks than for growth shocks. The stronger response of asset prices in more vulnerable EMEs to monetary shocks probably reflects not only that monetary shocks hit their economies harder, but also that monetary shocks boost the risk premium demanded by global investors, and this applies especially to the assets of riskier economies.====Our results are generally robust to a number of extensions: distinguishing between upward and downward surprises in the path of U.S. monetary policy; using alternative measures of U.S. interest rates or monetary policy surprises; estimating the regressions over different sample periods; using different measures of exchange rates and of EME vulnerability; and expanding the event window to look at spillovers to EME assets over longer periods.====Like prior research in this area, our analysis identifies strong and wide-ranging spillovers of U.S. interest rate surprises to emerging financial markets,. In this sense, as discussed further below, our work lends further empirical support to open-economy models featuring financial frictions and time-varying risk premia, issues thought to be especially prominent in EMEs (see, for example, Gertler et al., 2007, Akinci and Queralto, 2019, and Aoki et al., 2018). However, these models also suggest that the source of shock matters, and that a demand-driven rise in U.S. interest rates should lead to smaller financial spillovers than a rise in rates prompted by higher inflation or a hawkish policy shift. This point has not been addressed in the empirical literature so far. By distinguishing between the effects of growth and monetary shocks on EME asset prices based on identification using high-frequency financial data, we offer novel evidence highlighting the crucial role of the source of the shock that drives changes in U.S. interest rates.====By shedding light on the nature of monetary policy spillovers, our findings also have important implications for policy. First, we reinforce the importance of policy reform—especially in the external sector, but more generally as well—to reduce vulnerabilities and thus moderate spillovers from U.S. rate surprises. Second, EME policymakers need to be especially alert to U.S. tightening driven by inflation surprises or hawkish shifts, as those are most likely to trigger disruptions in emerging markets. In this regard, our findings are consistent with proposals for cyclical prudential policies that take into account the source of the shock (see Farhi and Werning, 2014; Aoki et al., 2018). Finally, Fed policymakers need to take into account that spillovers from policy tightening to EMEs and resultant “spillbacks” onto the U.S. economy will be larger in the case of monetary shocks than of growth shocks.====The plan of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the prior literature on this topic, while Section 3 describes the data and research design. Section 4 summarizes our main findings, and Section 5 describes various extensions and robustness checks.

We find that British investors demanded a higher equity cost of capital from firms operating in countries with weak property-rights institutions. Further, country-level expropriation risk is negatively related to 19th-century capital flows and present-day economic and financial development. A simple equilibrium model of the protection of investor property rights and risk premia rationalizes these findings. This evidence indicates that institutional quality influences growth, in part, through its effect on the cost of capital and investment.","Research in economic development points to the importance of institutions that protect property rights as a determinant of long-term income growth. This argument dates back to North and Thomas (1973), who argue that property rights provide the necessary incentives to accumulate human and physical capital.==== An equally well-established body of research views financial markets as important in the process of economic development. Since at least Schumpeter (1912), economists have argued that well-functioning financial markets improve the allocation of capital and promote growth by reducing transaction costs and information asymmetries.====In this paper, we link these two ideas. Specifically, we examine whether the equity cost of capital in the late 19th century reflected cross-country differences in the quality of institutions and whether differences in the historical cost of capital are related to economic development. Implicit in the notion that institutions affect economic growth is the premise that the allocation of property rights affects a firm's ability to make productivity-enhancing investments (Besley, 1995, Johnson et al., 2002, Claessens and Laeven, 2003). For example, suppose a firm operating in a country with weak property-rights protections tries to raise capital externally. In that case, outside investors, knowing there is a greater risk of expropriation, discount potential cash flows more heavily than they do those of a firm in a country that consistently enforces investment contracts. The equity cost of capital is higher and investment lower for the firm located in the country with imperfectly enforced property rights.====We use a data set of foreign equities traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) during the late 19th century to test these ideas. We first estimate the risk-adjusted cost of capital using standard asset-pricing methods and find that it is related to several empirical measures of institutional quality. The equity cost of capital negatively correlates with stronger institutional protections against expropriation risk. Second, we aggregate the firm-level cost of capital to form country portfolios and find that the overall cost of capital and the component related to institutional quality correlate with British foreign investment flows during the late 19th century and present-day levels of income and financial development.====The late 19th century is well suited to studying how the international equity market priced the quality of property-rights institutions. At the time, Great Britain was a major exporter of capital to the rest of the world, and London served as the principal global financial center (Michie, 2001). It was also a period of unprecedented global capital mobility, measured either in terms of flows or prices, and there were few legal or political barriers to international investment (Obstfeld and Taylor, 2004). Although estimates of British overseas investment during that period vary, the consensus is that it was more significant than that of other capital-exporting countries.==== The railroad, infrastructure, and natural resource-related projects financed by British capital laid the foundations for many countries outside the European core to industrialize.====These British investments were long-lived and derived their cash flows from real assets located in foreign countries. The high costs of screening and monitoring such long-term projects spurred the development of specialized investment banks and accounting systems that reduced the cost of verifying a foreign firm's compliance with an investment contract (Bordo et al., 1998). But information about whether a foreign firm breached an investment contract lacks value if investors’ property rights are imperfectly enforceable or entirely unenforceable. Although British citizens managed the investments, the projects outside the Empire were in foreign jurisdictions, creating the risk that contracts were unenforceable because the requisite institutions were weak or absent. Thus, the combination of large flows of development finance to a broad cross section of countries with different legal and political institutions provides us with an opportunity to study the role of property rights in the pricing of risk and determining the pattern of international investment.====To formalize the reasoning behind these ideas, we develop a simple two-period model that builds on Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2002), Stulz (2005), and Albuquerue and Wang (2008). In the model, a British investor allocates capital between domestic and foreign investments. The two investments are identical in every dimension except one: The foreign investment is subject to a fractional shock to cash flows owed to the British investor. We interpret the shock as the cost related to the imperfect enforcement of contracts and weak protection of property rights in the foreign country. The central insight of the model is that, in equilibrium, investors demand compensation for bearing the risk that their cash flows will be seized, which increases the cost of capital to the firm raising capital in the foreign country. Additionally, the premium associated with expropriation risk reduces investment in the foreign country as well as its second-period output. In a stylized way, these two conclusions highlight the effect of strong governance on the cost of capital, investment, and output growth.====The model's predictions frame our empirical analysis. Our data set consists of the returns of 1,808 equities traded on the London Stock Exchange between 1866 and 1907. About half of the firms were British firms that conducted their operations exclusively domestically. The other half were firms that operated in British imperial possessions or sovereign foreign countries. We first estimate the risk-adjusted cost of capital using asset-pricing methods and find that firms that operated in countries with strong property-rights institutions paid a lower cost of capital than similarly risky firms operating in countries with weaker institutions. We also show that historical country-level equity returns are related to actual expropriations of foreign direct investments during the 20th century. Finally, we find that the overall cost of capital and the component related to institutional quality at the country level correlate with 19th-century investment flows and present-day levels of income per capita and financial development. This evidence is consistent with the idea that financial markets are forward-looking and account for fundamental risk factors, such as institutional quality. It also points to the capital market acting as one channel, among others, through which property-rights institutions influence the pattern of economic growth and development.====In the following section, we discuss the related research at the intersection of insititutions, finance, and growth and how our paper builds on it. In Section 3, we develop a two-country asset-pricing model with expropriation risk and derive its implications. We discuss the London Stock Exchange equity return data and the construction of the test assets in Section 4. In Section 5, we provide evidence that British investors priced the quality of cross-country institutions in 19th-century financial markets. We focus on the relation between the cost of capital, British foreign investment, and present-day economic development in Section 6. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 7.","The price of property rights: Institutions, finance, and economic growth",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000265,16 February 2022,2022,Research Article,97.0

We estimate trade elasticities at the product level by exploiting the variation in bilateral tariffs for each product category for the universe of country pairs over the 2001 to 2016 period. The predicted trade flows using the product-specific trade elasticities estimated here match the observed post-EPA import between the US and Chile, confirming the accuracy of our estimates.","The global economy is currently confronted with an unprecedented resurgence of trade frictions due to the trade war initiated in 2018 and the Covid-19 outbreak crisis of 2020. The quantification of the welfare impacts of these higher trade costs for economies at different levels of economic development, and characterized by different sectoral specialization and degree of openness, requires the sound parametrization of the trade model that is used. Trade elasticity is one of these key parameters, especially when it comes to providing an order of magnitude of the trade and welfare impacts of a change in trade costs: changes in welfare are a function of the change in the share of domestic expenditure and the trade elasticity to variable trade costs (Arkolakis et al., 2012).==== As a tariff is a variable trade cost imposed by the importer country, the elasticity of trade values to changes in tariffs becomes the key parameter for many researchers and practitioners interested in evaluating the welfare effects of trade policies – see the approach coined as “trade theory with numbers” popularized by Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014). But while the first statistic – how much does a country trade with itself as a proportion of its total expenditures – is directly observable, the current estimates of trade elasticities diverge widely. Even restricting the comparison to the gravity estimates controlling for multilateral resistance terms leads to a wide range of values, as shown by Head and Mayer (2014) in their review of 435 elasticities from 32 papers: they obtain a median figure of 5.03 with a standard deviation of 9.3.====Reasons for such divergence pertain to methods and data. The trade elasticity can be estimated ==== a demand system (Feenstra, 1994; Broda and Weinstein, 2006; Ossa, 2015; Soderbery, 2018), using the non-arbitrage condition and product-level price data (Simonovska and Waugh, 2014; Giri et al., 2021), considering imports as inputs into the GDP function (Kee et al., 2008) or in a gravity framework (Caliendo and Parro, 2015). The requirement in terms of observed trade costs therefore depends on the choice of identification strategy. Estimating a demand system implies volume and prices at the finest classification level of traded products (Feenstra, 1994) with no ==== consideration of trade policies. Similarly, Simonovska and Waugh (2014) and Giri et al. (2021) use disaggregated prices data in respectively 2004 and 1990. Trade unit values are used as a proxy for prices in Kee et al. (2009), when estimating the import-demand elasticity as the percentage change in the imported quantity, holding the prices of other goods, productivity and the endowment of the importer constant. In contrast, Caliendo and Parro (2015) rely on the cross-sectional variations in trade shares and applied tariffs in 20 sectors and 30 countries to estimate sectoral trade elasticities. Data availability on trade costs and prices has accordingly constrained previous estimates of trade elasticities at product level.====In their survey of open questions related to the analysis of commercial policies, Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016) stress that “====”.==== This paper aims to at least partially fill this gap by constructing a new dataset on trade costs, and resorting to a simple and transparent estimation strategy to obtain product-level trade elasticities. By considering the universe of (preferential or MFN) applied tariffs and import flows at the bilateral and product level (using the 6-digit level of the Harmonized System – HS6 thereafter) for 152 importing countries and 189 exporting countries over the 2001–2016 period, we provide a set of estimations of theory-consistent trade elasticities at the product level and identify the determinants of heterogeneous product-level trade elasticity. In the process, we also recover the elasticity of shipping costs with respect to distance for each product. Our identification strategy does not rely on the prices of imports generally measured by disaggregate trade unit values and therefore subject to considerable measurement error and simultaneity bias.==== One important contribution of this paper is therefore identifying the trade elasticities ==== and using a global coverage of importing and exporting countries.====While Caliendo and Parro (2015) rely on the multiplicative properties of the gravity equation in order to cancel out unobserved trade costs, in line with the “ratio approach” introduced by Head and Ries (2001) and systematized as “Tetrads” by Martin et al. (2008) and Head et al. (2010),==== we here take a gravity approach using a strategy of fixed effects, as suggested by Head and Mayer (2014).==== This approach has the merit of generality, tractability and transparency, while being theoretically consistent.====To proceed, we use the most-disaggregated level of information on trade policies and bilateral imports available for the universe of products and importing countries – the HS6 that covers over 5000 different product categories – for a sample of 152 importing countries, including countries at lower levels of development with only partially-liberalized trade.==== We calculate the tariff elasticity of a given HS6 product (and so recover the trade elasticities and the elasticities of shipping costs with respect to distance) by comparing country's product-specific imports from different origins on which different tariffs are imposed.====For each HS6 product category we observe the universe of bilateral trade flows between countries, in value, in a given year, and the tariff (preferential or not) applied to each exporter by each importer on the specific product. This is done for 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016. A great deal of the variation in tariffs is cross-sectional.==== For this reason, we explain – for a given importer (and product) – the cross-country variation in imports ==== the cross-country variation in tariffs. We benefit from the fine grain of our data, and estimate not only product-level (HS6) trade elasticities but also sector-level trade elasticities by pooling the product-level observations within each sector.====Our preferred set of trade elasticities, when we keep the 1% level statistically-significant tariff elasticities and statistically-insignificant estimates are replaced by zero,==== is centered around −5, with an average figure of −5.3. Our results show considerable heterogeneity in trade elasticity across products. Beyond estimating these product-level trade elasticities, we show what lies behind their magnitude. Product differentiation plays a large role, as predicted by theory. Also, the estimated product-level elasticity is sensitive to distance, consistent with the selection of heterogenous exporters into distant markets. The observed heterogeneity of product-specific trade elasticity matters, not only because the average of inverse trade elasticities differs from the inverse of the average trade elasticity (Ossa, 2015): it matters also for the comparison of the welfare gains from trade for countries at different level of development. Using a standard Arkolakis et al. (2012) - ACR - multi-sector framework featuring a two-tier utility function, with the upper tier Cobb-Douglas and the lower tier Dixit-Stiglitz, we show that gains are ==== for developing countries.====A second contribution of this paper is showing that using tariff data produces accurate estimates of trade elasticities. We subject the data to a very demanding test in order to assess the accuracy of the estimated elasticities. While computable models generally fail to correctly predict the changes in trade flows from Free Trade Agreements,==== here we compare the ==== realized change in imports after a bilateral systematic tariff shock with the ==== changes based on the retrieved product-level trade elasticities. Considering the period covered by our data, the ideal candidate for such ex-post test is the 2004 US-Chile agreement. The ==== and ==== changes in product-level share of Chile's imports from the US line up fairly well, and importantly, much better than the predicted changes based on homogenous elasticity artificially created by averaging over the products. This test confirms the accuracy of our tariff-based product-level trade elasticities.====This paper speaks to the literature estimating trade elasticities with different methods. De Bromhead et al. (2019) take advantage of the swing in British protection during the 1930s and estimate trade elasticities for 9 categories of goods ranging from 1.47 to 23.47. Romalis (2007) obtains mean elasticities of substitution of between 6.3 and 10.9, based on US and EU imports from Canada (or Mexico) and control countries from 1989 to 1999. Using import data at the HS6 level, and trade unit values for 117 importers over the 1988–2001 period, Kee et al. (2009) obtain a simple average across product-specific import-demand elasticities of 3.12. Broda and Weinstein (2006) find an average value of 6.6 for US imports with 2715 SITC 5-digit categories, and 12.6 at the tariff-line (13,972 categories) level over the 1990–2001 period.==== Soderbery (2018) obtains a mean elasticity of 3.4 for 1243 HS4 product categories over the 1991–2007 period. Simonovska and Waugh (2014) use disaggregated prices from the International Comparison Programme for 62 product categories in 2004, matched to trade data in a cross-section of 123 countries. Their benchmark trade elasticity is 4.12. Giri et al. (2021) adopt the same strategy for 12 EU countries and 1410 goods (in 19 traded sectors) in 1990. They find a median trade elasticity of 4.38. At the industry level, Ossa (2014) estimates CES elasticities of substitution by pooling the main world importers in cross-section, which produces a mean value of 3.42 (ranging from 1.91 for Other Animal Products to 10.07 for Wheat). By combining GTAP 7 and NBER-UN data for 251 SITC-Rev3 3-digit industries, Ossa (2015) obtains an average elasticity of 3.63 (ranging from 1.54 to 25.05). Amiti et al. (2019) and Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) take advantage of the large swings in US tariffs and rely on US imports from January 2017 to December 2018 at the origin-month-HS10 level. Amiti et al. (2019) estimate an elasticity of substitution between varieties of 6,==== while the preferred value for US import-demand elasticity in Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) is 2.47. After controlling for exporter and importer fixed effects in their triple-difference approach, the trade elasticities in Caliendo and Parro (2015) range from 0.49 in the Auto sector to 69 in the Petroleum sector.==== Finally, in order to identify short- and long-run trade elasticities, Boehm et al. (2020) use the differential effects of variations in MFN ==== tariffs on imports from countries subject to MFN, relative to the control group of countries not subject to the MFN, and obtain product level long-run elasticities at the lower end of the range of existing estimates ranging from 1.75 to 2.25.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The construction of the dataset is detailed in Section 1. We present our theoretical framework and identification strategy in Section 2. Our trade elasticities estimated at the product level appear in Section 3, which also compares the change in welfare of a move to autarky for countries at different level of development, and tests the accuracy of our product level trade elasticities with an ==== validation exercise. Section 4 contains a series of robustness checks.

We prove a non-monotone impact of ==== it becomes large enough to be beneficial (Krugman's result). This non-monotonicity persists under heterogenous firms. The harmful small-scale trade is explained by variable markups and underpriced imports, which become socially excessive. Unlike protectionists, we argue that “liberalization should go far”. On the other hand, we show that anti-dumping measures can be viewed as a remedy for the aforementioned imports distortion.","It is a well-known theoretical result since Krugman (1979), that a complete trade integration, formulated as a switch from autarky to free trade, is welfare-enhancing for consumers under reasonable assumptions.==== The gains from trade are due to economies of scale, better exploited in an integrated market. What remained unclear, however, is how gains from trade unfold during a ==== transition from autarky to free trade.====To fill this gap, we revisit Krugman's question and ask whether countries necessarily gain at each step of trade liberalization, i.e., a decline in transportation costs. We maintain Krugman's original setup with two symmetric countries and arbitrary additive utilities with non-constant elasticity of substitution (non-CES). The paper focuses on welfare gains from trade liberalization in a range around autarky. For autarky to exist at finite trade costs, the demand system is assumed to have a choke price, which is the only additional assumption.==== This finite autarky point enables clear comparative statics via marginal reductions in trade costs.====We prove that trade gains are non-monotone: positive near free trade but negative at the beginning of trade liberalization. Moreover, there is a whole interval of trade costs near autarky where trade is detrimental to consumers in both countries. In other words, ==== under classical monopolistic competition with any neo-classical additive utility that enables autarky (at finite trade costs).====How can a technological improvement, i.e., lower trade costs, become socially undesirable? The immediate observation is a fall in the mass of firms, i.e., variety. It is in contrast with the benchmark CES case, where the mass of firms is constant and welfare improves monotonically with liberalization (because equilibria coincide with social optima, see Dhingra and Morrow, 2019 for a closed-economy scenario). This comparison suggests that, in our case, the observed non-monotone welfare should be explained by non-optimality—market ==== created by non-CES preferences. Specifically, there are two kinds of distortion in this environment.====The first distortion involves ====—consumers spend more on imports and transportation than is socially desired. Mathematically, this outcome stems from the increasing (absolute value of) price elasticity of demand (IED).==== In such IED situations (see Weyl and Fabinger, 2013), firms practice incomplete pass-through: they set higher markups for cheaper products. These unequal markups indirectly subsidize exports via higher prices of domestic goods. This generates “relative dumping”, meaning that a product's domestic price times the trade costs coefficient exceeds its export price.====Under relative dumping, the export price does cover the variable production and transportation costs. In that sense, there are no direct social losses from exports. However, there are opportunity costs: an inefficiently high amount of resources is spent on transportation costs, instead of being utilized for domestic production. Consumers spend too much on foreign varieties due to lower export markups relative to domestic varieties. A social planner, who maximizes world welfare, would forbid exports/imports in some neighborhood of autarky where trade gains are negative, postponing trade to further stages of trade liberalization.====The second margin of potential inefficiency, the Dixit–Stiglitz quantity versus diversity trade-off, turns out to be not so important. The mass of varieties in autarky can be insufficient or excessive.==== If variety is insufficient, the initial trade liberalization ==== this distortion by reducing variety, contributing to the welfare losses. In the opposite case of excessive variety, liberalization ==== the Dixit–Stiglitz distortion. However, even in this case, the export distortion explained above outweighs the Dixit–Stiglitz effect, so that overall welfare consequences of liberalization are negative near autarky. This leads to the idea that the entry distortion plays only a secondary role in our harmful trade effect. To demonstrate it formally, we consider a thought experiment where a regulator corrects the entry distortion at autarky through a license fee; we find that the welfare losses remain intact.====The export distortion raises a natural question of its source. Section 4 suppresses one-by-one several features of the market to identify the necessary element for the harmful trade effect via the following three thought experiments.====First, we ask if decreasing variety ==== plays a major role in the mechanism of welfare losses. To this end, we consider a regulator who prohibits entry/exit of firms during trade liberalization, i.e., ==== at the autarky level. We show that welfare decreases with liberalization near autarky even in this setting. Moreover, the welfare losses are accompanied by a reduction in gross consumption. This reduction is a bypass channel for welfare loss when variety is fixed, whereas the primary source is a waste of resources in transportation.====Second, we ask if the general equilibrium effects, such as business-stealing and increased competition, are necessary to generate the welfare loss. We construct a thought experiment, where the regulator ==== of each firm at the autarky level but allows for free entry. This regulation seems similar to the previous one because the equilibrium mass of firms remains unchanged due to the fixed labor supply. However, the behavior of firms is different: the output constraint now enters directly into the firm's profit maximization problem. In this setting, a reduction in trade costs affects neither competition nor profits (unlike Brander and Krugman, 1983). Yet, the harmful trade effect remains even without general equilibrium effects and the pressure of competition. In other words, wasteful transportation and dumping originate from the individual behavior of each firm.====Third, to demonstrate the necessity of dumping for the harmful trade result, we construct a regulation where ====, i.e., markups are forced to be equal across markets. Thereby, we exclude the export/domestic distortion, defined as a discrepancy between the consumer's marginal rate of substitution and the producer's marginal rate of transformation. Numerical simulations show that, in this environment, unlike the previous regulations, harmful trade disappears; welfare grows monotonically during trade liberalization. Analytically, we are able to prove that when such an anti-dumping policy is combined with fixed entry or fixed output constraint, the world welfare grows monotonically because the equilibria are second-best socially optimal, i.e., the domestic/imported consumption ratio remains optimal. This welfare-based argument advocates an anti-dumping policy during small-scale trade liberalization. However, we are not able to prove such an analytical statement in a general Krugman's setting with entry of firms.====Summarizing, various modifications of Krugman's model point to incomplete pass-through and dumping as the main driving forces for the harmful trade effect.====Further, we discuss the ==== of our harmful effect. Though it is proven locally near autarky, a numerical exercise with homogenous firms in Section 2 shows a substantial negative welfare effect, which extends non-locally. Specifically, in this example, countries do not enjoy any benefits from trade until trade costs are reduced by as much as a quarter from the choke level. Furthermore, in all numerical examples, the gains from trade have a U-shaped form. They behave approximately quadratically in volumes of trade: welfare grows slowly near its minimum and attains a sharp peak at free trade. These observations on non-linear effects suggest that “liberalization should go far” even in cases when the interval of negative gains is small.====The ==== is investigated in Section 5. Notably, our benchmark model is extended to a non-CES heterogenous firms setting la Melitz (2003), which becomes canonical nowadays. In this framework, we prove that the welfare losses near autarky remain intact. However, simulations show that heterogeneity mitigates these losses and squeezes the related interval of trade costs. Effectively, under heterogeneity, a better selection of firms (by productivity) partially compensates for the export distortion. In other extensions, we check that our result is robust to the introduction of multiple asymmetric countries and unequal trade costs.====Finally, coming to the practical relevance of our findings, we are not sure that the losses from trade can be detected empirically. They may be overshadowed by the Melitzian selection effect or by the Ricardian comparative advantage. Rather, for an economist, the take-aways from our study are the ideas about the export distortion, dumping associated with IED, and non-monotone gains from trade, eventually increasing with liberalization. Our arguments suggest that small-scale trade is not going to bring large welfare gains. That is why an international policymaker should ====: welfare increments should not fade with globalization but, rather, become ever larger. In addition, we find a novel, welfare-based, motive for anti-dumping policies when trade is modest in volume.","Increasing returns, monopolistic competition, and international trade: Revisiting gains from trade",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000277,15 February 2022,2022,Research Article,99.0

The market structure for the final product is ====. Production follows a preordered sequence and exhibits high complementarity between stages. There are three types of actors: upstream suppliers, downstream suppliers and final-good producers (firms). In designing their ====, firms in each stage choose not only the ownership structure, i.e., vertical integration versus outsourcing, but also the input-procurement strategy, i.e., delegation versus control. The separation of asset ownership and input-procurement rights leads to a novel organizational mode, which we call ‘outsourcing with delegation.’ We determine the implications of this new organizational mode in firms’ global sourcing decisions.","Since the seminal work of Coase (1937), there has been a growing interest among researchers to determine the boundaries of the firm by looking at the ‘make-or-buy’ decision. This is an important issue since in the US, based on the value-added data, transactions within the firm are roughly equal to those in markets (Lafontaine and Slade, 2007).====Like everything else, globalization has a significant impact on firm boundaries by changing the production process. Today's production involves sequentially structured chains expanding across multiple stages and countries. In response, firms are changing the way they think about their organizations.==== In the automotive industry for example, companies have been remodelling their systems with lean manufacturing. International fragmentation of production forced these firms to delegate some of the tasks they had traditionally controlled to their Tier-1 suppliers (also called contract manufacturers or contract suppliers). Japanese automakers took this path first and falling behind, the big three U.S. automakers had to follow (McKinsey Global Institute, 2005). Parallel developments have been occurring in electronics as well as apparels and garments. Further, production links render firms’ transformations more challenging than before. While settling on their make-or-buy decisions, firms now have to take into account the effect of a decision in one stage on another within a value chain. More broadly, the design of supplier networks is as important as the final products and firms need to develop innovative methods by looking at some traditional functions differently. One such function is procurement. In a value chain, firms can decide not only how to source a product from a given supplier but also how to procure inputs to be used in the making of that product. By assigning a more strategic role to procurement, firms can fine-tune their supplier networks better.==== For instance, in reorganizing their supply chain, Chrysler reshaped its entire procurement function (Gottfredson et al., 2005). The success of this fine-tuning often relies on the way with which partnerships are organized and managed. This is important since there is no such thing as perfect contract and there are problems with contract enforcement. Therefore, aligning the incentives of suppliers is crucial to maximize the chain's performance. For instance, the misalignment of Cisco's interests with those of its contract manufacturers caused the company to write off $2.25 billion of inventory in 2001.====In this paper, we argue that the alignment of incentives can go beyond the make-or-buy decision and the assignment of procurement rights can provide firms additional flexibility in organizing their value chains. With globalization, firms can tap into several markets to acquire materials in a cost effective way. At the same time, managing multiple suppliers with diverse backgrounds can complicate the procurement process. For example, different local cultures, practices and languages might attenuate the advantages of doing business abroad. In such circumstances, delegating the procurement function to another agent who has better leverage might be worthwhile. These arguments are in line with Brewer (2006). Using internet survey data collected from 265 purchasing managers in the electronics industry, he finds that the capability and leverage of contract manufacturers play a significant role in the delegation of procurement. Moreover, he points out that cost savings of contract manufacturing due to delegating procurement are often associated with offshore (international) activity. This is so since in a foreign market in which cultural, political, language, or other barriers exist, firms’ procurement leverage might be weaker relative to contract manufacturers who are more familiar with the market conditions.====Our framework is built on the property-rights model of firm boundary. The market for the final good is described by monopolistic competition. Production follows a sequential supply chain such that any good produced in the upstream stage is a factor to produce a good in the downstream stage, which itself is employed in the final output. There are three types of agents: final-good producers (firms), downstream suppliers and upstream suppliers. Inputs are highly specific and their quality is hard to verify by third parties. As a result, written contracts are not enforceable and there is a standard hold-up problem. Nevertheless, firms can alleviate this inefficiency by optimally choosing their organizational form. This sequential setup is similar to Karabay (2017), which combines the firm boundary model of Antràs (2003) and the heterogenous-firms model of Melitz (2003) to analyze the global sourcing decision of firms similar to Antràs and Helpman, 2004, Antràs and Helpman, 2008. In Karabay (2017), determining the optimal organizational form involves choosing the optimal ownership structure in each stage, i.e., integration versus outsourcing. That paper shows that while it is always optimal to procure the upstream input via outsourcing, either ownership structure (integration or outsourcing) can be chosen in the downstream stage. Thus, if integration ever occurs, it can only do so in the downstream stage. This result is supported by the empirical studies of Alfaro and Charlton (2009) and Del Prete and Rungi (2017), both of which find that multinationals tend to own later stages of production more likely than earlier stages. The novelty in the current paper is to go a further step in designing the firm's architecture and consider not only the optimal ownership structure but also the optimal input-procurement strategy, i.e., delegation versus control.==== Accordingly, in case arm's length contracting (outsourcing) is chosen in the downstream stage, firms may find it optimal to delegate their Tier-1 suppliers the procurement of inputs in the upstream stage. Consequently, in equilibrium, three types of firm configuration can emerge in the downstream stage: (1) vertical integration (insourcing), (2) outsourcing, and (3) outsourcing with delegation. In this setup, outsourcing with delegation provides an alternative to vertical integration in reassigning control rights between suppliers to provide appropriate incentives.==== This reasoning is in agreement with Gereffi et al. (2005), which emphasize the existence of alternative arrangements to vertical integration in achieving the coordination of global production systems. By relying on the complementary performance of others (which in our case the delegation of procurement to the independent downstream supplier), firms can perform well without direct ownership.====We then analyze firms’ decision of (i) organizational mode and (ii) sourcing location when international sourcing is viable. There are two countries, North and South and they differ in terms of the wage rate and hold-up friction. In the South, while the wage rate is lower, there is more efficiency loss due to a greater hold-up friction. We show that sourcing the upstream input from the South, where the underinvestment problem is more severe, causes firms to more likely to resort to delegating procurement rights to their Tier-1 suppliers.==== We can see examples of this happening in various sectors. In electronics industry, the computer giant Dell delegated the purchase rights for keyboards, casings and printed circuit boards to its Taiwanese Tier-1 suppliers.==== Similarly in automotives, Chrysler handed over the purchase of all 200 parts of ‘rolling chassis’ for Chrysler Dakota pickup truck in Brazil to Dana Corporation (Veloso and Kumar, 2002). The same trend can also be observed in apparel and garment sector: Ralph Lauren delegated the procurement of fabric for its knit and woven shirts, active wear and denim wear to Luen Thai of Hong Kong (Sodhi and Tang, 2013).",A new dimension in global value chains: Control vs. delegation in input procurement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000162,12 February 2022,2022,Research Article,100.0

The model-based counterfactual analysis predicts the overall price index in Russia to have increased by 0.33% and welfare to have declined by 1.84% due to the embargo.,"In the spring and summer of 2014, political relations between the Russian Federation and Western countries cooled dramatically, following an escalation of tensions in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Seeking to influence the decisions taken by the Russian government, Western countries gradually implemented financial and economic sanctions. In response, in August 2014, Russia introduced an embargo on certain food and agricultural goods.==== Overall, this trade restriction targeted 48 products from the EU, the US, Australia, Ukraine and some other countries that supported the sanctions. The list of banned products comprises meat, meat products, milk and dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and nuts — everyday products for Russian consumers.==== While the declared objective of the policy was to harm foreign food producers, it also had an impact on the Russian economy.====This paper quantifies the effects of the self-imposed food embargo on consumer prices and welfare ====. We first provide empirical evidence for a surge in prices of embargoed and linked products, caused by the embargo. We document the immediate and medium-term price hikes in a difference-in-differences framework, disentangling product-specific from macroeconomic effects. We do so by employing a comprehensive micro-level dataset of consumer prices for a broad set of products, disaggregated by city and date, allowing us to control for various product-, region- and time-specific effects. The dataset of monthly consumer prices is sourced from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service and includes a variety of embargoed and non-embargoed food items and various other types of goods and services. The analysis shows that the embargo led to an average increase in the prices of embargoed products of at least 2.6%, relative to non-embargoed products. The short-run effect after about 6 months is estimated at 7.7% – 14.9% and the average effect over the whole time period at 2.6% – 8.1%. We then explore whether trade diversion and product substitution can explain this smoothing of the effect, using customs- and domestic production data, respectively. Importantly, we observe that consumer prices for ==== food products also increased, hinting at a propagation of the impact via input-output linkages.====Recognizing that non-embargoed sectors may have been indirectly affected by the policy, we then construct a theoretical trade model in the spirit of Caliendo and Parro (2015). The model assumes sectoral linkages, trade in intermediate goods and sectoral heterogeneity in production. Goods may be either tradable, non-tradable, or ====, which implies non-tradability across ==== country pairs. We then use the model to run a quantification exercise to evaluate and dissect the price and welfare effects in Russia. We calibrate the model with data on the production and usage of intermediate inputs in 42 countries from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) from the pre-sanction period. We take data on bilateral tariffs from the Market Access Map (MacMap). A snapshot of pre-sanctions bilateral trade flows is sourced from the BACI dataset provided by CEPII (Gaulier and Zignago, 2010). To model the embargo state of the world, we construct a counterfactual situation that exhibits prohibitive trade costs on the import of embargoed goods from sanctioning countries to Russia, i.e. making them non-tradable across these country pairs.====Our simulations suggest that Russia experienced a welfare loss of 1.84% due to this self-imposed embargo. Furthermore, overall average prices in Russia are predicted to have increased by 0.33%, those for embargoed sectors by on average 7.9% and 0.27% for non-embargoed goods. The results of these model-based simulations are thus in line with our estimates using actual price data.====Our paper contributes to the growing literature on the effects of sanctions, embargoes and boycotts. Despite sparse evidence for their effectiveness, they continue to be popular instruments of foreign policy (Drezner, 1999). The recent rise in their use has renewed the interest to study their outcomes. Etkes and Zimring (2015), e.g., investigate the effect of the Gaza blockade. Their counterfactual exercise reveals welfare losses of 14% – 24%. The identified causes are the reallocation of resources and a decline in labor productivity. Heilmann (2016) studies the effect of consumer boycotts on trade. In multiple case studies using a synthetic control group methodology, he finds significant reductions in imports following abrupt shifts in consumer preferences. Haidar (2017) studies the recent case of Western-imposed sanctions on Iran. He finds that for Iranian firms, aggregate exports decreased, despite the diversion of trade to non-sanctioning countries. Exporting firms experienced losses due to the fall in prices, with small firms being particularly severely harmed. Lee (2018) examines the spatial distribution of economic activity in North Korea under economic sanctions, concluding that sanctions prompt increased regional inequality. Besedeš et al. (2017) study the consequences of financial sanctions for the balance of payments of German firms during the period 2005 – 2014 and find a direct negative effect for bilateral financial sanctions on cross-border capital flows. The effect is lower in cases in which the EU alone imposes sanctions, hinting at possible sanctions evasion. Our paper contributes to this broader literature on sanctions, boycotts and embargoes by investigating the impact on consumers in the affected economy. Next to an analysis of detailed price microdata, we go beyond the current state of the literature by embedding an embargo setting into a quantitative trade model to simulate economy-wide effects of the measures.====A number of papers have focused specifically on the impact of the sanctions against the Russian Federation and their countermeasures. Strong pre-sanction economic ties between Russia and sanctioning countries make this case particularly instructive. Dreger et al. (2016) evaluate the macroeconomic impact of the sanctions regime using a multivariate VAR model. They find that the sanctions had a limited impact and attribute the downturn in the Russian economy to the decline of oil prices in early 2015. Crozet and Hinz (2020), estimate the effect of the sanctions regime on trade, i.e. the exports of both sanctioned and ==== countries. They find significant “friendly fire”, where even firms that were not directly impacted by any measure nevertheless exported significantly less towards Russia. They also note that firms directly affected by the Russian embargo on food and agricultural products were able to recoup only a fraction of the lost exports in other markets via trade diversion. The most closely related research to this present paper is Boulanger et al. (2016), where the authors simulate the short-run impact of the Russian food embargo on the Russian and European economies in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) exercise. According to their estimates, Russia lost 3.4 billion EUR of real income, equivalent to a 0.24% reduction in per capita utility. At the same time, the EU-28 lost 128 million EUR, or 0.0025% of per capita utility. They model the Russian import ban as a loss in existing trade preferences, leading to a reduction in consumer utility. Our research advances methodologically upon their study by accounting for the realistic input-output structure of modern economies.====In most cases, one or more sanctioning countries implement restrictive measures against another country. However, in some rare cases, a country decides to prohibit its own population from trading with others.==== This study contributes to the sanctions literature with the analysis of ==== sanctions. To the best of our knowledge, only one historical event of this kind has been previously studied. In 1807–1809, the United States introduced a full embargo on international trade with European countries, in an effort to harm Great Britain. Irwin (2005) finds that this decision, also known as Jefferson's blockade, cost the United States approximately 5% of its GNP. During the period of the blockade, domestic prices of exported goods declined, whereas those of imported goods increased. O’Rourke (2007) employs a CGE model to assess the consequences of the blockade for Britain, France, and the United States. He shows that the U.S. experienced the strongest welfare loss, equivalent to 4–5% of GDP per annum. Our paper contributes to this strand of the literature by analyzing the effects of a self-imposed embargo in the modern globalized economy, where trade in intermediate goods has become a defining feature. In fact, one main conclusion of our paper is that a significant part of the overall impact is due to the effects of embargoed imported inputs.====In the theoretical part of our paper we construct a Ricardian model of trade á la Caliendo and Parro (2015), and thus relate to a recently flourishing literature that evaluates trade policy changes in this rich yet highly-tractable class of models. Employing the so-called “exact hat algebra” following Dekle et al. (2008), we solve the model in changes and obtain welfare effects by comparing trade shares that the model predicts to the ones observed. The key advantage over traditional CGE models is that such approach requires a minimum of macroeconomic data and associated assumptions. Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) provide a comprehensive summary of related research on the outcomes of globalization. In another case of heavily politicized change of bilateral trade policies, Dhingra et al. (2017) estimate the welfare effects of Brexit in the medium to long run with a number of counterfactuals. In a similar vain, Mayer et al. (2019) estimate potential welfare losses for any EU member states from no longer being part of the EU. For the purpose of our study, we extend the model proposed by Caliendo and Parro (2015) by featuring ==== country-pair-sector combinations — sectors that are tradable across some country pairs but non-tradable across others — by rendering bilateral prices conditional on the possibility of trading, i.e. the absence of a embargo.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide first empirical evidence of the changes to consumer prices due to the embargo. In Section 3 we then introduce a model of trade with sectoral linkages, trade in intermediate goods and sectoral heterogeneity in production that distinguishes between tradable, non-tradable and embargoed sectors. The model allows us to easily compute the welfare outcomes for the trade frictions introduced by the embargo. We describe the calibration of the model and discuss the counterfactual simulations in Section 4.

Standard economic theories of trade agreements attribute this variation to politics: There must be less liberalization in industries in which the government of the importing country is under more political pressure to soften competition from abroad. According to this view, the objective of trade agreements is to prevent a prisoner's dilemma in which each country engages in a futile attempt to improve its terms of trade by limiting imports, only to have its attempts canceled out by similar actions of other countries. Therefore, as articulated by Bagwell and Staiger (1999), under a fully efficient trade agreement politics will be the only cause of variation in negotiated tariffs, implying that a country's import market power must have no bearing on the level of negotiated tariffs.====It should come as no surprise that trade agreements in the real world show significant signs of inefficiency. This is confirmed by studies that establish a significant correlation between import market power and negotiated tariffs, which—as noted above—is a manifestation of inefficiency in trade agreements under neoclassical models of trade. Different theories have been proposed regarding the cause of inefficiency in negotiated tariffs, including ==== a free-riding problem that may be caused by the WTO's nondiscrimination requirement, and ==== asymmetric information about government preferences. Theories based on the above two causes generate starkly different predictions about the relationship between import market power and negotiated tariffs.====An understanding of the causes of inefficiency in trade agreements is key to evaluating future proposals to reform the institutions of international trade. If there is evidence that the MFN clause has caused a substantial deviation from efficiency, a reform proposal in the WTO would have to address the problem of free riding by either relaxing the requirements of the MFN clause or by requiring countries to cut tariffs based on a formula rather than voluntary bilateral negotiations. In contrast, if asymmetric information is shown to be the primary cause of inefficiency in the WTO, more attention should be given to the WTO dispute settlement process and flexibility mechanisms such as safeguards and antidumping.====Our objective in this paper is to evaluate the effect of free-riding and asymmetric information on the pattern of negotiated tariffs under the auspices of the WTO. We base our analysis on the premise that the role of trade agreements is to internalize the Terms-of-Trade (ToT) externality of unilateral trade policies, but various obstacles in the negotiation process—such as the free-riding incentives and asymmetric information—may prevent the parties from fully internalizing these externalities. Within this framework, import tariffs could improve a country's ToT at the expense of foreign countries by dampening the world price of its imports. Assuming efficient negotiations, a standard ToT analysis implies that any variation in negotiated tariffs should solely reflect the political-economy preferences of the governments across products—i.e., negotiated tariffs must be ==== of the import market power of the importing country (Bagwell and Staiger, 1999, Bagwell and Staiger, 2002; Grossman and Helpman, 1995). In contrast, in the absence of a trade agreement, unilaterally-chosen tariffs will be increasing in the level of the country's import market power in the respective sectors.====Ludema and Mayda (2013), henceforth LM, argue that because of the MFN-driven free-riding problem, the WTO members were unable to completely internalize the externalities of import tariffs. To elaborate, consider a case where multiple countries export a particular good to a specific importing country. Interested exporting countries could participate in formal negotiations with the importing country through which they would offer individual concessions to the importing country in exchange for tariff cuts. Because of the MFN clause, negotiated tariff cuts will be applied to imports from all WTO members regardless of whether they participated in the negotiations.====In deciding whether to participate in tariff cut negotiations with the importing country, an exporting country faces a tradeoff: By participating in the negotiations, an exporting country gives more incentive to the importing country to undertake a deeper tariff cut but it will also have to offer concessions of its own. Therefore, an exporting country will join the negotiations if and only if it has a sufficiently large stake in it, namely, iff it supplies a sufficiently large fraction of the importing country's demand.====Because the participation of the interested exporting countries in tariff-cut negotiations is incomplete, the negotiated tariffs will not fully internalize the terms of trade effect of tariffs. As a result, the negotiated tariffs will be still increasing in the import market power of the importing countries, especially in products where the free-riding problem is more severe.====The delegation theory of tariffs offers a starkly different hypothesis regarding the pattern of tariff commitments under the WTO. Based on a delegation theory of tariffs (Bagwell and Staiger, 2005; Amador and Bagwell, 2013), Beshkar et al. (2015), henceforth BBR, argue that if governments care about flexibility in setting their trade policy (due to uncertain political-economy preferences, for example), the optimally-negotiated tariffs must depend ==== on the importing country's import market power. This negative relationship arises from the tradeoff between flexibility and externality: A higher negotiated tariff offers more flexibility while at the same time opens the door for greater negative externality from tariffs.==== Therefore, it is jointly optimal for the governments to put a stricter bound on tariffs in sectors that generate greater international externalities, i.e., sectors in which the importing country has a stronger import market power.====We evaluate, both theoretically and empirically, the potential roles that the MFN-driven free-riding and the flexibility-externality tradeoff play in the design of trade agreements. To this end, we extend the analyses of LM and BBR by proposing a hybrid model that incorporates the potential role of free riding in the tradeoff between flexibility and externality. Our model, therefore, provides a framework to compare the empirical relevance of the opposing patterns predicted by the flexibility-externality tradeoff and the free-riding problem. A careful empirical analysis of this matter requires a conceptual model that allows for the existence of these patterns of tariff commitments with and without an MFN-driven free-riding problem. Our strategy, therefore, is to develop a hypothesis based on the free-riding theory and test it against alternative hypotheses regarding the variation of negotiated tariffs across countries and sectors.====A novel theoretical result—different from that of LM and BBR—arises under our hybrid model: In the presence of the MFN-driven free-riding problem, the effect of the Import Market Power (IMP) on the negotiated tariff caps is ==== (see the solid graph in Fig. 1): In particular, there is a threshold of IMP below (above) which the negotiated tariff cap is decreasing (increasing) in IMP.==== In the absence of a free riding problem, this relationship is non-increasing as depicted by the dashed graph in Fig. 1.====The above threshold of IMP also divides tariff lines into two groups: If the IMP is below this threshold, the negotiated tariff caps are ====, meaning that under some states of the world, the importing country finds it optimal to choose a tariff below the cap, thereby generating a ====.==== For values of IMP above this threshold, however, the negotiated caps are ====, namely, the importing country will find the negotiated cap restrictive under all states of the world and, hence, no tariff overhang is ever observed.====We test and compare the hypotheses of the above theories using the tariff binding data from the WTO, trade volumes, and various proxies for countries’ import market power in an industry. Our empirical findings strongly point to the tradeoff between flexibility and externality in negotiated tariff caps: Generally, negotiated tariffs are negatively related to the country's import market power in the concerned products. On the other hand, the predictions of the MFN-driven free riding theory are generally inconsistent with the observed variation in the data.====Recall that while a pure free-riding model predicts a positive causal relationship between IMP and negotiated tariff bindings, a pure flexibility-externality model predicts a negative relationship. Our empirical finding that this relationship is in fact negative does not necessarily mean that free-riding did not affect WTO negotiations, because it could merely imply that the effects of free riding were dwarfed by the effect of a preference for flexibility in tariff obligations. As suggested by our theory, the potential effects of free riding may be isolated from the effect of flexibility-externality tradeoffs in the subsample of strongly-bound tariff lines. That is because in this subsample the net value of flexibility is always negative and, thus, no flexibility is afforded to the government under the agreement. Therefore, among strongly-bound tariff lines, the relationship between negotiated tariffs and ==== is only affected by free-riding. Implementing this strategy, however, does not produce any evidence in favor of the free-riding hypothesis.====We confirm the main estimation results of LM that negotiated tariffs are increasing in the Product Differentiation Index (PDI). However, based on our model, we offer a different interpretation of this relationship. The difference between our empirical results and those generated in LM is primarily due to the use of different proxies for IMP and negotiated tariffs. As their main measure of IMP, LM use the degree of ==== while we use an estimate of the inverse of the foreign export-supply elasticity.====We argue that LM's finding that tariffs are increasing in the degree of product differentiation reveals the role of ====, rather than ToT effects, in trade agreements. To see this, note that the degree of product differentiation is a direct measure of ==== such that products with a lower degree of differentiation have a higher demand elasticity. Moreover, as we know from political-economy models such as Grossman and Helpman (1995), efficiently-negotiated tariffs are lower in products with more elastic demand. This result reflects a simple Ramsey Taxation argument in political-economy trade models: As also pointed out by Goldberg and Maggi (1999), in products with a higher demand elasticity, it is more costly for the government to transfer welfare to producers by means of taxing imports. Therefore, efficiently-negotiated import tariffs must be higher in products with a greater degree of product differentiation.====Finally, we provide a simple procedure to predict unilaterally-optimal tariffs based on observed negotiated tariff caps and applied tariffs under the WTO. While the variation in the political-economy weights of import-competing industries is at the core of the tariff overhang model, we lack an empirical measure of the political-economy weights. The model, however, suggests that the pattern of applied and negotiated tariffs across industries and countries contains a wealth of information about the political-economy weights. Using our results on the relationship between negotiated tariff caps, applied tariffs, and export supply elasticities, we back out the political weight of each industry-country pair. We then use these calibrated weights to predict the tariffs that would be chosen by each country in the counterfactual in which countries are not bound by any caps on their applied tariffs.====There are a few previous attempts at predicting applied tariffs that reflect the political-economy influence of different industries in the absence of trade agreements. Notably, Ossa (2014) calibrates political economy weights based on the variation in non-cooperative tariffs across industries. The data on non-cooperative tariffs (namely, tariffs imposed on non-WTO members) is available only for a few countries. In contrast, our approach enables us to make this prediction for all country-industry pairs for which data on applied and negotiated tariffs are available.====These back-of-the-envelope calculations yield a prediction of unilaterally-optimal tariffs that reflect each industry's political weight in the objective function of governments across the world. In particular, the median of optimal tariffs for countries ranges from 8% for Georgia to 73% for Bangladesh. The United States has the second highest median optimal tariffs at 64%. This analysis yields a large estimate of optimal tariff for many small and developing countries with low import market power, which reflects the strength of political motives in trade policy making in those countries. For example, in the absence of political weights, the median optimal tariff for Bangladesh is 7%, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the median of its politically-optimal tariffs. For the United States and European Union, however, the difference between political and nonpolitical optimal tariffs are much smaller.====After a brief discussion of the related literature in the next section, we lay out our basic economic environment in Section 3 and introduce our model of negotiated tariffs in Section 4. In Section 5, we describe the data and proxies that we use. In Section 6, we present our empirical methodology and findings. In Section 7, we discuss a simple procedure to predict unilaterally-optimal tariffs based on observed negotiated tariff caps and applied tariffs.

We develop a theoretical framework for studying the interplay between international integration and identity politics, taking into account that both policies and identities are endogenous. We find that, in general, a union is more fragile when peripheral member countries have higher status than the politically dominant “Core” countries, as this leads in equilibrium to stronger national identification in the periphery and a lower willingness to compromise. Low-status countries are less likely to secede, even when between-country differences in optimal policies are large, and although equilibrium union policies impose significant economic hardship. Contrary to the anticipation of many union advocates, mutual solidarity is unlikely to emerge as a result of integration alone.","The interaction between economic policy and identity politics is increasingly seen as central for understanding international economics, from trade policy to currency areas to the European Union (e.g., Grossman and Helpman, 2021, Rodrik, 2021). Nationalist sentiment, for example, is often seen as a threat to the European project and is regularly associated with the ascent of Eurosceptic political parties (Hobolt and de Vries, 2016, Noury and Roland, 2020). This raises important questions about economic and political integration. Does a common identity strengthen a union? Which countries are more likely to join a union and which are prone to secede when identity and economic considerations interact? Have advocates of the European project been overly optimistic in assuming that integration promotes mutual solidarity, i.e. individuals from one country caring about the wellbeing of individuals from other member countries? We propose a simple analytical framework to help think about these questions, taking into account what we know about the workings of social identity, and focusing on an equilibrium in which both integration and identities are endogenous. We have four main results:====How should we model identity? Research in both economics and psychology documents the ways in which individuals associate themselves with groups, and how this affects their behavior (for a review see Shayo, 2020). The evidence indicates two broad patterns: (a) caring about the success and wellbeing of one's group, often manifested in costly preferential treatment of this group; and (b) seeking to be similar to other individuals in one's group. Importantly, such group-related behavior is endogenous: people are more likely to identify with those groups that are more similar to them and that can make them proud and confer higher status. Hence, identities not only shape but also respond to economic circumstances. Formally, people gain utility not only from their personal payoffs but also from the success (or “status”) of the group with which they associate themselves. That is, if my group does well, my utility increases. However, individuals cannot easily identify with ==== group to which they belong, and incur a cognitive cost for identifying with a group that is actually quite different from them. Thus, to maximize utility, individuals can engage in two different strategies. First, they can seek to increase the status of their group and to reduce their perceived distance from it. Second, they can change their identities. A German citizen, for example, may identify as a German but may, to some extent, also identify as a European. If the status of Europe is high relative to that of Germany alone (perhaps due to its history), identifying with Europe can raise that citizen's utility.====We consider a simple bargaining game between two countries: a Core and a Periphery. Each country has its own optimal policy, reflecting its economic fundamentals, culture, political ideology, etc. Integration entails economic gains to both countries (e.g. from increased trade), but means they need to share a common policy. The politically dominant Core sets a common policy for the union (e.g. monetary, trade, or immigration policy). The Periphery then chooses whether to join the union or leave and set its own policy. Replicating classic results, unions in this model are less likely to be sustained in equilibrium when cross-country differences in optimal policies are large. The question is: what policies does the union adopt, and at what point does the union disintegrate? We say that a union is more ==== if its policies better suit the needs of the politically weaker Periphery (at some economic cost to the Core). We say a union is more ==== if it is sustained under larger differences in optimal policies between members.====While this model is relevant to many settings in which minority regions may seek secession (Canada, Spain, UK), for concreteness we use the European Union and the eurozone as the running examples. Thus, one can think of France and Germany as the Core, politically dominant countries within the union, while countries like Denmark, Spain, the UK and Greece are Periphery countries that choose whether or not to be part of the union. Members of each country may identify nationally (i.e. with their country) or they may identify with Europe as a whole. Accordingly, there are four possible identity profiles: (====, ====), (====, ====), (====, ====) and (====, ====), where the first entry in each pair denotes the identity of members of the Core and the second denotes the identity of members of the Periphery. For example, (====, ====) denotes a situation in which members of the Core identify nationally and Periphery members identify with Europe. It should be stressed that identifying with Europe does not imply disregarding your country and caring only about Europe: it simply means placing some weight on the success of, and similarity to, Europe whereas an exclusive national identity does not.====To begin, consider the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) under a given profile of social identities. Consistent with common views and survey data, a union is more accommodating when citizens of the Core identify with Europe. This is partly because the Core then effectively internalizes some of the goals of the Periphery. However, a union is ==== accommodating when the Periphery identifies with Europe. Leaving the union makes it psychologically costly for the Periphery to continue identifying as European. Hence, as long as the periphery identifies as European, the Core can preserve the union with smaller concessions. Notably, the profile (====, ====) in which everyone identifies as European is not always the most robust. For this to happen, the cost of identifying as European without being in the union has to be high. Otherwise, the (====, ====) profile can be more robust.====Taking social identities as given could, however, be misleading. It is by now well-established that ethnic, national or other social identities are changeable, and respond to the social environment in systematic ways (Chandra, 2012, Shayo, 2020). This suggests that—consciously or unconsciously—individuals choose to identify in a meaningful way with some of the social categories to which they belong, but not with others; and that economic and political processes can affect this choice. Thus, while in principle we can derive the policies under any profile of social identities, it is unclear whether all these identity profiles can in fact be sustained. Recall that people are unlikely to identify with groups that are very different from them or have very low status, when a more similar or higher status alternative is available. But perceived differences can be endogenous to whether the countries are part of a common union or not; and the status of both the union and of the potential member states is also endogenous to integration decisions and to the policies that are in place. We therefore focus on the “Social Identity Equilibrium” (SIE), where both identities and policies are mutually consistent.====Consider the simplest case, in which the countries are ex-ante symmetric in status and similarity to the group does not affect identification decisions. In this case, in almost any equilibrium in which the union is sustained, the Core identifies nationally while the periphery identifies with the union (the identity profile is (====, ====)). Given any other identity profile, and sufficiently small differences in optimal policies such that the union can be sustained in SPNE, equilibrium policies lead to an (ex-post) status advantage for the politically dominant Core. This means that non-(====, ====) profiles would not in fact be sustainable. From this perspective, the expectation that unification ==== would lead to the emergence of a common identity seems misplaced: the very success of a union works to enhance national identification in the union's dominant Core countries. This last intuition extends to the more general case. National identification is of course shaped by many forces, but it is a mistake to expect unification per se to act as an automatic antidote. This is our first main finding.====A second important result is that under fairly general conditions, when the Periphery has lower status than the Core, unification can be sustained in SIE despite large differences in optimal policies across countries. The basic reason is that once agents are allowed to choose their identity, members of a relatively low-status Periphery will seek to identify with the union. To the extent that it is psychologically easier to identify yourself as European if you are a member of the EU—or if your currency is the euro—then this increases the Periphery's willingness to make economic concessions in order to be part of the union. Hence the union can be sustained under larger differences. This happens despite—and to some degree because of—the union's unaccommodating policies vis-a-vis the Periphery, which accentuate the Periphery's inferiority.====Our third point is that when the Periphery has equal or higher status than the Core, disintegration can occur despite small differences in optimal policies. Such equilibria are characterized by national identification in the Periphery (though not necessarily in the Core), which reinforces the Periphery's reluctance to make policy concessions.====Fourth, consider policies that alter the salience of inter-regional differences. We find that when people care less about such differences, the union can be sustained under higher differences in optimal policies. Moreover, this (weakly) increases the set of circumstances in which both unification and an all-European (====, ====) identity profile can be sustained in equilibrium.====The paper relates to several strands of literature. The first studies monetary and fiscal unions. In particular, the theory of Optimal Currency Areas starting with Mundell (1961) highlights the difficulty in handling asymmetric shocks with a common monetary policy. The main benefits from joining a currency union are trade increases due to the elimination of currency conversion costs and greater predictability of prices (Mundell, 1961, Rose and Honohan, 2001), and the ability to overcome inflation by joining a monetary union with a credible anchor country (e.g. Barro and Gordon, 1983, Alesina et al., 2002, Aguiar et al., 2015, Chari et al., 2020). The theory suggests that countries are more likely to join a currency union when they have high price and output comovements with other countries in the union, when they trade more with them, and when they cannot commit to low inflation (Alesina et al., 2002). We propose a simple way to incorporate identity politics into this understanding of monetary unions, thereby improving the political realism of these models.====Second, a growing literature, pioneered by Akerlof and Kranton (2000), examines the implications of identity in economics (see Chen and Li, 2009, Benjamin et al., 2010, Bénabou and Tirole, 2011, Chen and Chen, 2011, Shayo and Zussman, 2011, Lindqvist and Östling, 2013, Bertrand et al., 2015, Cassan, 2015, Holm, 2016, Kranton and Sanders, 2017, Besley and Persson, 2019, Hett et al., 2020). Guriev and Papaioannou (2021) provide a review of the closely related—and overwhelmingly empirical—literature on populism. The closest to our paper are Shayo, 2009, Bonomi et al., 2021, and Grossman and Helpman (2021), who study how social identity shapes policies like redistribution and tariffs. These papers focus on how the identity profile ==== a country interacts with that country's policy. We build on these contributions to study how identity can shape interactions ==== countries.====Third, the literature on the political economy of international integration highlights the tradeoff between the costs of heterogeneity and the gains to unification due, e.g., to market size, economies of scale, cross-regional externalities, or better monitoring of politicians (Alesina and Spolaore, 1997, Bolton and Roland, 1997, Casella, 2001, Lockwood, 2002, Harstad, 2007, Desmet et al., 2011, Boffa et al., 2015). We develop a model that features such a tradeoff and examine both how the introduction of social identity modifies the political equilibrium and how the political equilibrium affects identification patterns.====Finally, a substantial literature studies public attitudes towards international integration. Many explanations focus on economic factors, but non-economic factors clearly play an important role (Mayda and Rodrik, 2005). In the European case, the general conclusion of this literature is that identity-related concerns are at least as important as economic factors in explaining support for European integration (Hooghe and Marks, 2004; see Hobolt and de Vries, 2016 for a review). Data we collected around the Brexit referendum also show that, at least at the individual level, voters’ identity (measured before the referendum) strongly predicts their voting decisions, controlling for a host of socio-demographic and geographic characteristics (Appendix C.1). However, less is known about how such attitudes affect policies, and, especially, about the properties of the equilibrium. Does a common identity produce a more stable union? And what identity patterns can we plausibly expect to emerge?====We proceed as follows. Section 2 presents the model. The following two sections develop the building blocks for our solution concept: the determination of integration policy given social identities (Section 3), and the choice of identity (Section 4). Section 5 analyzes the equilibrium in which both policies and identity are endogenous. We conclude in Section 6.",International integration and social identity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000095,3 February 2022,2022,Research Article,103.0

We show that quality investments lead to an additional margin of adjustment in the gravity equation. In ,"Firm heterogeneity and product quality have been documented as important determinants to explain export success and patterns of international trade. A large literature following Melitz (2003) highlights that the presence of fixed costs can explain the selection of more productive firms into export markets. Chaney (2008) shows that the interaction of firm heterogeneity and fixed costs of exporting leads to adjustments on the extensive margin in the gravity equation as trade barriers prevent low productivity firms from exporting. Accounting for quality differentiation across industries is crucial to reconcile empirical patterns with trade models of firm heterogeneity. Empirical evidence documents that the most successful exporters offer high-quality products at higher prices, and are larger as well as more productive compared to exporters of low-quality varieties.==== As high-quality firms generate larger sales, they can more easily overcome trade barriers and select into more distant markets (Baldwin and Harrigan, 2011, Crozet et al., 2012, Manova and Zhang, 2012). Related studies show that high quality industries are less sensitive to distance (Ferguson, 2012, Martin and Mayneris, 2015).==== This evidence suggests that quality differences across industries do not only influence pricing patterns but also the effect of trade costs on export flows.====The purpose of this paper is to analyze how quality differentiation influences the effect of trade costs on export flows and on the extensive margin. We introduce endogenous quality choice in a multi-country model with heterogeneous firms. In our framework, the export decision is governed by variable and fixed trade costs. Besides this, firms also choose the optimal level of quality innovations, which are associated with additional fixed costs and increase product demand.==== The main finding of this paper is that endogenous quality innovations reduce the impact of fixed costs of exporting on trade flows through adjustments on the extensive margin. We derive the gravity equation by assuming that the distribution of firm productivities is Pareto.==== Our theoretical setup allows to divide the elasticity of trade flows with respect to fixed export costs into a direct negative effect as in Chaney (2008) and a new counteracting quality effect that depends on the scope for quality differentiation in an industry. This measure captures the expenditures for quality innovations relative to firm sales, and is determined by exogenous technology parameters in the quality production function. In industries with a larger scope for quality differentiation, the returns from investments are higher. Hence, the most productive firms invest relatively more in innovation and reap larger market shares compared to low productivity firms.====The mechanism of our model has important implications for trade liberalizing policies and the gravity equation. We show that the combination of endogenous quality choice and fixed costs of exporting leads to an additional margin of adjustment in the gravity equation, which is not present in existing trade models with quality differentiation. As in models without quality choice, we show that a decrease in fixed trade costs induces low productivity firms to enter export markets. However, in an industry with high scope for quality differentiation, these entrants are relatively small as they face strong competition and can only reap a small market share compared to existing suppliers. Hence, the effect of fixed trade barriers on the extensive margin and on export flows is attenuated in industries with high quality differentiation. Note that this result is opposed to the impact of horizontal differentiation (Chaney, 2008). In our model, a higher degree of horizontal differentiation leads to stronger effects of fixed costs on the extensive margin, as new entrants can reap larger market shares. We further highlight that the impact of variable trade costs on export flows does not depend on the scope for quality differentiation and is just determined by the Pareto shape parameter as in Chaney (2008).====We test the main predictions from our model using aggregate trade data and Brazilian firm-level data. Because we are interested in firm-level outcomes depending on the scope for quality differentiation of the industry, we combine trade data with two measures for quality differentiation that are closely related to our theoretical model: (i) the “quality ladder” suggested by Khandelwal (2010), and (ii) the R&D intensity of the industry along with a proxy for horizontal differentiation, as used by Kugler and Verhoogen (2012). We interact these measures with proxies for variable and fixed trade costs to estimate the effect on exports and on the extensive margin in the gravity equation.====The estimates confirm the main predictions of our model that the scope for quality differentiation reduces the elasticity of trade flows with respect to fixed costs, while horizontal differentiation has the opposite effect. Consistent with our model, we also find that the effect of variable trade costs on export flows and on the extensive margin does not vary with the industry's scope for quality differentiation. We further show that the effect of distance is reduced in more differentiated industries, which is consistent with evidence from highly disaggregated data.====We use firm-level data to present two relations that provide further supportive evidence for the mechanism of our model. First, we show that quality differentiation strengthens the positive impact of productivity on firm-level sales, while horizontal differentiation attenuates this effect.==== Second, we show a positive correlation between firm size and export prices, which is stronger in highly differentiated industries. These facts provide supportive evidence for our main mechanism that firms influence product quality by their investment decisions, which are related to the scope for quality differentiation in the industry.====Finally, we apply our model and evaluate the effects of a change in trade policy that reduces fixed costs of exporting. We simulate the effects on exports by industry and compare it to the results obtained by heterogeneous firm models without quality differentiation. Relative to this benchmark, our simulation shows that the positive effects of liberalizing policies on exports are substantially lower on average, and become much more dispersed across industries. We evaluate ex-ante welfare gains from trade and show that endogenous quality innovations also reduce the elasticity of welfare with respect to fixed costs of exporting.==== Hence, we conclude that considering the interaction of fixed export costs and quality differentiation is important to evaluate the gains from policies aiming at reducing trade barriers.====Our paper builds on a large literature that explores the micro-theoretical foundations of the gravity model and the gains from trade.==== We contribute to this literature by showing that the interaction of endogenous quality choice and fixed trade costs leads to a new channel of adjustment in the gravity equation. This mechanism is not present in heterogeneous firms models with exogenous quality differences (Baldwin and Harrigan, 2011, Di Comite et al., 2014) and does also not occur in a framework with binary technology choice as in Bustos (2011).==== The way how we model quality innovations is closely related to Kugler and Verhoogen (2012), who concentrate on the relationship between firm characteristics and prices while neglecting trade costs.====In contrast to exogenous quality differences, heterogeneous firm models with endogenous quality choice are in line with empirical evidence that exporters vary investments across destinations depending on trade costs and market size (Verhoogen, 2008, Bastos and Silva, 2010, Martin, 2012, Manova and Zhang, 2012, Bas and Strauss-Kahn, 2015, Flach, 2016). Within this literature, our framework is most closely related to three papers that allow for endogenous quality investments.==== First, Antoniades (2015) introduces market-specific quality choice in a two-country model with firm heterogeneity and endogenous markups. In line with this paper, our framework captures that prices increase with firm size if the scope for quality differentiation is large, and that trade costs reduce quality investments and hence firm-level prices. Antoniades (2015) shows that a larger market size increases the scope for quality differentiation while only considering variable trade costs. In contrast to our framework, this implies that there is no interaction of trade costs and quality differentiation in the gravity equation. A common feature is that the effect of variable trade costs only depends on the Pareto shape parameter. Second, Alcalá (2016) focuses on variable trade costs in a Ricardian model with Cournot competition and shows that the average quality of exports, measured by average export prices, increases in a country's revealed comparative advantage. Although the channel through which quality affects exports is quite different, a common feature with our framework is that quality differentiation increases the market shares of larger exporters. Third, Fan et al. (2015) show that tariff reductions increase firm-level export prices and quantities. The authors rationalize this result by a quality upgrading mechanism. While our model predictions on firm-level outcomes are consistent with their finding, we focus on the implications for aggregate trade flows and the extensive margin.====Our model provides a supply-side explanation for the interaction of quality differentiation and trade costs. We further show that our results are robust when controlling for demand-side effects of product quality in international trade, which strongly suggests that these effects do not alter the positive predictions from our model. Fajgelbaum et al. (2011) develop a general equilibrium model with non-homothetic preferences that provides a demand-based explanation for trade in goods of different quality. In this framework, aggregate demand leads to trade specialization via home-market effects reminiscent of a Linder (1961) hypothesis.==== Hallak (2010) finds evidence for the Linder (1961) hypothesis and shows in a sector by sector analysis that countries more similar in income trade more with each other.==== While Fajgelbaum et al. (2011) build on a discrete choice of quality and variety, Eaton and Fieler (2019) introduce quality differentiation and an extensive margin of products in a general equilibrium model of international trade based on Eaton and Kortum (2002). The framework captures a positive relation between unit values and per capita income of trading partners by still delivering a standard gravity equation for trade flows. Feenstra and Romalis (2014) allow for non-homothetic preferences and quality choice on the supply side, which gives rise to Alchian and Allen (1964) effects.==== Whereas they focus on the estimation of quality-adjusted prices, we exploit industry variation of quality differentiation to derive the implications for the gravity equation. Consistent with these studies, our results show that income effects, comparative advantage and product weight are important to explain trade patterns. Most importantly, our coefficient of interest remains stable and significant when controlling for demand side explanations. Hence, the main focus of this paper is on results for trade flows as we find no evidence that non-homotheticity would change those positive predictions.====Our paper also contributes to a growing literature that uses theoretically motivated demand equations to estimate the implications of price and quality effects (Redding and Weinstein, 2020, Jäkel, 2019). These papers typically exploit demand shocks over time while not taking into account the impact of endogenous fixed costs of quality choice.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical model and derives predictions for the empirical analysis. Section 3 describes the data, and Section 4 presents the empirical analysis. In Section 5, we estimate the parameters of our model and simulate the effects of a reduction in trade barriers. Finally, Section 6 concludes and more technical information is contained in a web appendix.",Quality and gravity in international trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000101,26 January 2022,2022,Research Article,104.0

The collapse of the Rana Plaza building in April 2013 generated a surge of activism and media coverage specifically targeting the firms that sourced from the factories affected by the disaster. Using monthly firm-level import data from French Customs, we study any potential disruption in these firms’ imports from all origins, and specifically from Bangladesh. We use a difference-in-differences approach. French textile imports from Bangladesh rose continuously after the shock, and the overall imports of retailers sourcing from the Rana Plaza show no drop after the event. Our results do reveal a relative decline in Bangladeshi imports for those retailers named for sourcing from the collapsed factories. This effect is mirrored by a relative increase in these exposed firms’ imports from four particular countries, which are non-Asian and are geographically closer to France.","The development of globalized production carries with it the risk of diluting the responsibilities of multinational firms towards their foreign factors of production and the environments in which they operate. Strategies to counter the opacity of global value chains have emerged at different levels, both public==== and private.==== Among the latter, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have publicly denounced firms for their observed unethical behavior: NGO campaigns, providing information to consumers about the hidden and undesirable characteristics of the production processes of goods or inputs, aim to put pressure on companies by harming their reputations. Whether this public naming of companies brings about any change in their behavior is in general still an open academic question, given the difficulty in measuring both the changes demanded by NGOs and the firms’ reactions. In some contexts, such as the case examined here, we can put numbers to this phenomenon.====We here ask how a major industrial scandal, revealing information about company misbehavior, affected their imports of consumer goods sourced abroad. We focus on an event that generated a great deal of criticism towards multinational firms: the collapse of the Rana Plaza building near Dhaka, in Bangladesh, on April 24==== 2013. This building contained factories that manufactured clothing for global Brands: however, it was not designed for industrial use. Activists immediately denounced the companies that had been sourcing from clothing factories located in the building. These denouncements of indifference to labor rights were echoed in the media of many developed countries.====We use firm-level French Customs import data in the clothing industry to investigate how firms’ import flows of final garment products changed after the shock, according to whether the importing firm was associated with the collapse. The list established by the NGO Clean Clothes Campaigns in the aftermath of the collapse names 29 retailers that sourced from the Rana Plaza. There are three possible scenarios, each reflecting different demand- or supply-related mechanisms. First, the Bangladesh story assumes that all Bangladeshi imports fall following the disaster, irrespective of the Brand, reflecting either a selective boycott of Bangladesh by consumers or a change in local supply conditions. Second, the Rana firms scenario has a fall in all imports irrespective of origin by firms that sourced in the collapsed building, which may show consumers seeking to punish the firms associated with the disaster. Last, in the Rana-from-Bangladesh story, only the Bangladeshi imports of firms named for their relation with the Rana Plaza drop following the shock. The main explanations here are supply-based: the drop in imports can be the result of production capacity destruction, following the collapse of the building hosting knitting factories. Or, the Rana firms could decide to shift part of their production to other countries, in order to minimize the probable negative reputation effect of the shock on their sales.====We estimate these different scenarios via difference-in-difference analysis. Our results provide evidence for the Rana-from-Bangladesh story: a relative fall in the share of imports originating from Bangladesh, specific to the retailers that sourced from the Rana Plaza. This fall is not paralleled by any change in their overall imports. We investigate the nature of the mechanism which led to the different evolution of the two groups of firms’ supplies in Bangladesh. We detail the chronology and the volumes involved in the effect. The relative decline starts one month after the shock and persists at a stable level throughout our sample period. We compare the magnitude of the effect on imports found in our estimations to the amount that should have disappeared in the scenario in which only production capacity destruction caused the drop in sourcing. Our estimate highlights a much larger response than the effect expected from the destruction of the building. Our results thus suggest that Rana firms chose to move a volume of supplies beyond the destroyed items to alternative countries, potentially further away from the center of the disaster.====We study the pattern of Rana firms’ imports from a list of major apparel supplier countries to France, other than Bangladesh. The major Asian textile producers show no significant change in supply to the Rana firms, however four countries exhibit a significant increase in the relative imports of Rana firms compared to those of non-Rana firms after the collapse: Turkey, Morocco, Poland and Portugal. The fall in Bangladeshi imports is thus paralleled by greater imports by Rana firms from three specific origin countries, all of which are non-Asian and located relatively close to France.====These outcomes support a potential scenario in which retailers have pulled part of their imports out of Bangladesh to reallocate them to geographical and regulatory closer countries to France. We compute the extra import cost due to the switch of countries, from the higher unit prices of imports when sourcing from Turkey, Morocco, Poland and Portugal. This provides us with an estimate of how much the reputation loss was worth for those importers. Finally we show that retailers (be they Rana firm or not) having signed the “Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh” did not experience the same drop in imports as the one we highlight in our main results. This allows to show that the relative decline found for Rana-firms cannot be attributed to their participation in the Accord.====Our paper contributes to different strands of the literature. It first provides new evidence of the causal effects of campaigns on corporate behavior. While private regulation has gained importance in both the public debate and the academic literature, very little work has been able to link changes in companies’ practices to NGO shaming, partly due to the difficulty in comparing activists’ demands.==== In well-known examples of campaigns, activists have challenged firms to change particular components or side-effects of the production process, such as deforestation (targeting Staples, 2001), work conditions (Nike, 1997), and drug prices (Novartis in the late 1990s). Instructive case studies (O’Rourke, 2005, Spar and La Mure, 2003) discuss companies’ reactions to these campaigns. Harrison and Scorse (2010) is the central reference for the estimation of the causal effects of campaigns on wages in the apparel and footwear industry, analyzing campaigns targeting subcontractors of Nike, Reebok, and Adidas. We propose to estimate one related consequence of campaigns: the firm-level trade effects of an ethical scandal denounced by activists.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the impact of boycotts (Heilmann, 2016, Michaels and Zhi, 2010, Fuchs and Klann, 2013, Crozet and Hinz, 2020). One difference is that these contributions correspond to situations in which products from specific countries, and not firms, are the main targets. The drops in demand in these cases are caused by consumer political motives, and not beliefs about inferior products or firm quality. Hendel et al. (2017) is the only paper to quantify the impact of consumer activism on a firm, following the company's pricing policy in the cottage-cheese industry in Israel in 2001.==== Our paper complements this literature without, however, studying the effects of an official boycott: as is often the case when suppliers in developing countries are involved, activists’ demands relate to the production process, carefully avoiding asking for boycotts so as not to harm local productions.====Last, we help map out the multidimensional consequences of the scandal that followed the Rana Plaza collapse. Jacobs and Singhal (2017) provide indirect evidence on the effect of the scandal on demand, via firms’ stock-price reactions to the shock. There was a significant negative, but very short-lived, effect of the Rana Plaza disaster on firms’ valuations. Boudreau (2020) analyzes the private regulation effects implemented by firms in a randomized controlled trial in 2017–2018 post-Rana Plaza Bangladesh. Cajal Grossi et al. (2019) and Cajal Grossi (2016) provide a thorough and detailed description of contracting with domestic factories in the fast-fashion industry. Ahlquist and Mosley (2021) report that firms with more public exposure (larger sales, multinational structure) were more likely to commit to future safety inspections than others in Bangladesh. Finally, Bossavie et al. (2020), using six waves of the Bangladesh Labor Force Survey, emphasize that although formal reforms were implemented after the collapse, and informal labor management was carried out by retailers, the net effects on the labor market for garment workers were mixed. Employees benefited from better sick leave and some workplace-safety measures, but their job security and hourly wages simultaneously fell. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to analyze the firm-level trade effects of an ethical scandal denounced by activists.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the Bangladeshi clothing industry and retailers sourcing from the country to supply the French market. We set out the context of the accident and the focus of activists on fashion retailers. Section 3 lists the different ways in which we expect imports to react, together with the respective supply and demand mechanisms behind each story. Section 4 introduces the data, presents the firms directly associated with the disaster, and describes the evolution of aggregate and disaggregated imports. Section 5 presents the empirical results, and the final Section 6 investigates several mechanisms that may underly the evolution of imports around the time of the event.",The effects of the Rana Plaza collapse on the sourcing choices of French importers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000083,20 January 2022,2022,Research Article,105.0

In line with our empirical findings, we show that the headquarter tends to keep an unethical supplier at arm's length.","The past three decades have been characterized by an unprecedented fragmentation and geographical dispersion of production. Value chains span all over the globe and even firms with a strong national branding have highly segmented international supply chains. This internationalization of production takes place in a context of substantial cross-country differences in environmental and labor regulation and international regulation of production is weak at best (Battaglini and Harstad, 2020). With heterogeneous national regulatory regimes, international production and sourcing decisions are taken in the ==== (Short, 2013).====With the expansion of international production, firms and their suppliers are more and more frequently accused of using the regulatory void to cut costs at the expense of the environment, local workers and future generations. There is a large number of examples in which allegations of ‘unethical’ or ‘immoral’ practices have led to consumer boycotts and NGO campaigns against global players in a diverse set of industries.==== In addition to highlighting that upstream ‘unethical’ technology choices can have a negative feedback effect on downstream demand, these examples exhibit a striking pattern: in all cases, criticism of ‘unethical’ practices concerns actions by ==== suppliers rather than subsidiaries of multinational firms. This leads us to ask: are strong economic incentives for ‘unethical’ production associated with outsourcing production to independent suppliers?====This paper makes two main contributions. First, we confirm the above intuition in a thorough empirical analysis based on the U.S. related-party trade database. We find that high potential cost savings of ‘unethical’ production in an industry favor international outsourcing and most strongly so for sourcing from low-regulation countries. Second, we introduce a cost-saving ‘unethical’ technology with the potential to trigger a consumer boycott into a standard property-rights model of the international organization of production and use it to identify the ==== as a novel determinant of the international organization of production. We show that in equilibrium, the interaction of the supplier's (un)ethical technology choice and the headquarter's ‘unethical’ outsourcing incentive biases the organizational decision of the firm. In line with our empirical findings, high potential cost savings from ‘unethical’ production incentivize the firm to choose outsourcing rather than integration.====Our empirical analysis builds on the literature studying the determinats of the international organization of production (especially Nunn and Trefler, 2013, Antràs and Chor, 2013, Antràs and Yeaple, 2014, Antràs, 2016). We correlate a standard measure of vertical integration, the industry-level share of intrafirm imports in total U.S. imports, with a new measure of potential cost savings of unethical production for U.S. firms: the share of expenditure on hazardous waste removal in total cost at the industry level. We think of this as a measure of the potential cost savings a U.S. firm in this industry could realize in the absence of environmental regulation.==== As potential cost savings can translate into real cost savings only when production takes place in a low-regulation environment, we also allow the effect of this variable to differ systematically across source countries. We therefore include an interaction between our measure of the potential cost savings of unethical production and measures of environmental policy stringency.==== At the same time, we control for the standard determinants of the international organization of production identified in the prior literature.====Our results are in line with the pattern suggested by the examples above. We find systematic evidence that ==== (as opposed to vertical integration) and most strongly so for sourcing from low-regulation countries. In other words: over and above the well-known determinants of the international integration vs. outsourcing decision, firms in sectors with high potential for unethical cost savings tend to keep suppliers at arm's length rather than to integrate them into the firm. While we identify this novel determinant of the international outsourcing decision, we also find that its introduction does not alter the effects of well-known determinants of integration highlighted in other contributions like capital intensity, R&D intensity and skill intensity.====Building on these empirical results, we analyze a model that can rationalize our findings and allows for further theoretical investigation into the underlying mechanisms. We take the seminal contribution by Antràs (2003) as a starting point and design a simple baseline model to analyze the effect of (un)ethical production and consumer boycotts on the international organization of production.====In our model, a headquarter in the Global North sources an intermediate input from a supplier located in the Global South. The headquarter can choose between an arm's length relationship (international outsourcing) and vertical integration of the supplier into the firm. The Global South is characterized by a level of regulation and enforcement capacity that allows suppliers to choose between two types of technology: a high-cost and a low-cost technology. The latter delivers identical product quality, but generates an externality on a third party (e.g. local pollution, unsustainable extraction of renewable resources, forced overtime or poor labor, safety and health standards in production).====The first premise of our analysis is that these externalities raise ethical concerns on the side of consumers in the Global North potentially resulting in a consumer boycott of the final product.==== We refer to the high-cost and the low-cost technology as ==== and ====, respectively. We assume that the implementation of the unethical technology does not affect the physical properties of the final product. The type of technology used (and therefore the externality it possibly imposes) constitutes a credence attribute: a property consumers do care about, but which cannot be inferred from the final product even after consumption (Feddersen and Gilligan, 2001, Baron, 2011).====The second premise of our analysis is that production along international value chains is characterized by incomplete contracts both in terms of investments ==== in terms of technology choice. Non-contractible investments are the key feature of the large literature on the international organization of production pioneered by Antràs (2003), who applies the property-rights theory of the firm by Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990) to international production. We argue that this contractual incompleteness naturally extends to the implementation of technology: in our model no contract effectively binds the supplier – whether at arm's length or integrated – to implement the ethical or unethical technology type. This important assumption is discussed in detail in Section 3.1.3, where we argue that the massive difficulties of internationally active firms to assure compliance of suppliers with legally binding codes of conduct are a strong indication for the relevance of contractual incompleteness for (un)ethical production.==== Where does the contractual incompleteness arise? Clearly, labor and environmental standards are not too complex to be specified ex-ante (which would be a standard case of incomplete contracts, as mentioned by Hart and Moore, 1999). We argue that contractual incompleteness arises when it comes to verifying and enforcing the contracts. The appropriate definition from the literature is therefore that the action of the supplier is “observable but nonverifiable” (Hart and Moore, 1999, p. 118). We discuss this definition in Section 3.1.3 and argue that it applies in this case.====We use our baseline model to address the following questions: Why do firms with high potential cost savings of unethical production tend to choose arm's length relationships when sourcing from low-regulation countries? How does the introduction of an unethical technology and consumer boycotts interact with the well-established mechanisms at the heart of the literature on the international organization of production?====Our first main result shows that suppliers tend to implement the ==== technology in sectors characterized by a ====, i.e., those in which suppliers contribute a large share to the overall production process. The reason is that when considering unethical production, the supplier faces a trade-off between its expected losses from unethical production (taking the form of a consumer boycott occurring with a given probability) and the associated cost savings. The latter are proportional to the investment, which in turn increases in the supplier intensity. This generates a direct link between a high supplier intensity and the implementation of the unethical technology.====Our second main result is the identification of a new driver of the integration vs. outsourcing decision. Our model preserves the mechanics of Antràs (2003), i.e., a high supplier intensity is associated with outsourcing, a high headquarter intensity with integration. We identify an additional effect which we label the ====. This additional incentive kicks in when the headquarter anticipates unethical production by the supplier. In this case, the firm faces a boycott with a positive probability while benefitting from the lower marginal cost of production for the supplier's input. While the expected loss resulting from the former is fixed and exogeneous, the latter is proportional to the supplier's investments. As the headquarter also benefits from lower production costs of the supplier it has an additional incentive to opt for outsourcing and thereby boost the supplier's investment. Conditional on unethical production, therefore, the range of sectors in which the headquarter optimally chooses outsourcing is larger compared to the case when ethical production is anticipated.====Our third main result combines the insights of the first two and characterizes the equilibrium technology choice and the associated organization of production. We show that three types of sectors need to be distinguished. In a group of sectors with intermediate levels of the supplier intensity, the supplier's choice of the unethical technology interacts with the unethical outsourcing incentive, which then overturns the optimal organization of production from integration to outsourcing. In these sectors, headquarters opt for outsourcing if and only if suppliers produce unethically, creating a strict dichotomy between unethical outsourcing and ethical integration. For sectors with either high supplier intensities or sectors with high headquarter intensities, in contrast, the organization of production is unchanged compared to Antràs (2003). In these sectors, our model can also generate ethical outsourcing (sectors with high supplier intensity) and unethical integration (sectors with high headquarter intensity) as possible equilibrium outcomes.====Our fourth main result links the model to our empirical findings. We show that the bias towards outsourcing is increasing in the cost advantage of unethical production. That is, everything else equal, firms in sectors with a stronger cost advantage of unethical production are more prone to choosing outsourcing. A larger cost advantage of unethical production has two effects. First, given the headquarter intensity, the supplier is more likely to choose unethical production. Second, it strengthens the unethical outsourcing incentive so that conditional on unethical production outsourcing is chosen for a larger range of headquarter intensities. This implies that our model can indeed rationalize the findings of our explorative empirical analysis: controlling for other sector characteristics – especially the headquarter intensity of production – ====.====Our fifth main result highlights a tension between aspirations and reality when it comes to the headquarter's actions. In the public debate, firms are frequently accused of lying when claiming to be in favor of ethical production while actually expanding unethical production. We show that this can be an equilibrium outcome due to the combination of non-contractible technology and the unethical outsourcing incentive. This is the case when the headquarter would ==== the supplier to implement the ethical technology (which it cannot impose due to incomplete contracts) but optimally responds to anticipated unethical production by expanding it in order to maximize unethical cost savings.====In Section OA.5 of the Online Appendix, we present an extension of the baseline model, in which we explicitly consider the origins of consumer boycotts. This extension provides economic foundations for several ad hoc assumptions in the baseline model and underscores the robustness of our main results. The central premise of this extension is that advocacy NGOs can partially fill the regulatory void by means of private politics (Baron, 2003). In line with the literature on private politics, discussed in detail below, NGOs can investigate the type of technology used and organize campaigns and consumer boycotts to sanction unethical production. They can thereby push firms towards self-regulation, i.e., towards implementing the ethical technology although the unethical technology is available. We introduce an NGO screening firms for signs of unethical behavior and organizing consumer boycotts in response. The NGO starts a boycott whenever it is certain that a firm has implemented the unethical technology. This can either be the case when its beliefs (formed according to Bayes’ Law) lead the NGO to this conclusion or when a costly investigation of the firm provides evidence of misconduct. While in the baseline model we impose that failure of an unethical firm to pool with ethical firms leads to a boycott with certainty, we derive this as an equilibrium outcome in the extended model. Moreover, we show that all results from the baseline model hold qualitatively in the extended model, especially those relating to the empirical analysis. By explicitly modeling the NGO-firm interaction potentially leading to consumer boycotts, the extension provides an important private politics underpinning of the baseline model.====Our paper contributes to the large literature on the international organization of production pioneered by Antràs (2003) and surveyed in Antràs and Yeaple (2014). Several determinants of the choice between vertical integration and international outsourcing have been identified and analyzed both theoretically and empirically. This includes capital/headquarter intensity in Antràs (2003), firm heterogeneity in Antràs and Helpman (2004), contractibility of inputs in Antràs and Helpman (2008), task routineness in Costinot et al. (2011), and downstreamness of the supplier in the value chain in Antràs and Chor (2013). In this paper, we suggest the regulatory void, unethical production and consumer boycotts as an additional driver of the international organization of production.==== The central premise of the property-rights theory of the firm is that the headquarter can never control the investment of the supplier. Be it under integration or outsourcing: contracts always remain incomplete. We extend this to the choice of the production technology. This allows us to stay very close to the Antràs (2003) setting and within the logic of the property-rights theory of the firm.====Our work also relates to research on the pollution haven hypothesis pioneered by Copeland and Taylor (1994) who formalize the idea that differences in environmental regulation affect the international location of production. This triggered a large literature on trade (FDI) and the environment which is surveyed in Copeland and Taylor (2004).==== Our approach has in common with this literature that we view regulatory differences as a driving force of the internationalization of production. We add the possibility that questionable actions in the production process may feed back on demand through consumer boycotts.====Our paper also resonates with the literature on the wage premium from foreign ownership (e.g., Aitken et al., 1996, Lipsey and Sjöholm, 2004, Girma and Görg, 2007, Heyman et al., 2007, and more recently Setzler and Tintelnot, 2021). While the empirical pattern is very robust, different theoretical explanations have been suggested, such as superior technology (Fosfuri et al., 2001, Glass and Saggi, 2002), rent-sharing at the firm level (Egger and Kreickemeier, 2013), or wage-anchoring to headquarter levels (Hjort et al., 2020). Our analysis suggests an additional and complementary channel: with unethical production being linked to low wages, our finding that outsourcing correlates with unethical production, directly implies a wage premium for integrated multinational firms.====By explicitly modeling the firm-NGO interaction and the possibility of consumer boycotts in the extended model in Section OA.5 in the Online Appendix, our paper contributes to bridging the gap between International Economics and the literature on private politics started by Baron, 2001, Baron, 2003. The latter focuses on social activists (NGOs) attempting to affect firm behavior not through lobbying for regulation (public politics) but through campaigns and boycotts of firms (private politics). This literature takes an Industrial Organization approach and analyzes the interaction of activists, firms and possibly a regulator under different market structures and allowing for strategic interactions between all parties. Some of the main contributions include Innes (2006), Baron, 2007, Baron, 2010, Lyon and Salant (2013) as well as Baron (2016) and Egorov and Harstad (2017). Closely related to the private politics literature, but with a different focus, are works on the private provision of public goods and corporate social responsibility (CSR) surveyed by Kitzmuller and Shimshack (2012).====Issues related to private regulation, social activism and NGO-firm interactions in global value chains have received much more attention in Political Sciences and Management Studies. This literature finds that social activism is instrumental in the establishment of codes of conduct in multinational supply chains and analyzes further determinants of their success in case studies and, more recently, in large firm-level datasets.====Most related to our work, a small number of papers introduce elements of private politics into International Economics. Aldashev and Verdier (2009) analyze the international competition for funds among development-oriented NGOs. Aldashev et al. (2015) consider the impact of NGO campaigns on industry structure in a setting with endogenous mark-ups and monopolistic competition. Krautheim and Verdier (2016) analyze the endogenous emergence of a consumer-financed NGO in response to the offshoring decision of a firm. Kitzmuller (2012) takes the model of Besley and Ghatak (2007), who explicitly model an NGO as a potential provider of a public good, to the international level. On the empirical side, Hatte and Koenig (2020) use a large dataset on international NGO campaigns and analyze the determinants of the geography of international activism. Couttenier and Hatte (2016) shed light on how NGOs adjust their campaigns to media (in)attention, in their case due to large-scale sports events.====With respect to the overall research question, Fu et al. (2018) is most related to our work. Their analysis and reasoning is closer to the literature in Industrial Organization, rather than International Economics. They analyze a monopolist that chooses between integrating a supplier or keeping it at arm's length. There are two important similarities their modeling has with our approach. First, a (cost-saving) infringement by the supplier may entail a punishment for the firm. Second, contracts are incomplete and the firm cannot in all cases influence the supplier in its decision to infringe or not. Despite these similarities, there are several important differences between their approach and ours. Different to their purely theoretical work, our starting point is an empirical analysis based on (and extending) the well-established empirical approach of the literature on the international organization of production pioneered by Antràs (2003) discussed above. Our empirical findings can therefore best be rationalized and interpreted using a theory which is based on the standard framework of the Antràs literature. Fu et al. (2018) make several assumptions which differentiate their model strongly from the Antràs literature: they model a single monopolist rather than monopolistic competition; they implement incomplete contracts using the transaction cost approach rather than the property-rights theory of the firm;==== and they overturn a central assumption in the Antràs literature by assuming that quantities (investments) are ====. The latter is a fundamental difference to the Antràs approach (and more generally to the seminal work by Grossman and Hart, 1986, Hart and Moore, 1990), where investments (quantities) are ==== non-contractible variable. This assumption is all the more relevant, as in Fu et al. (2018) the contractible quantity produced actually turns into ==== for the firm to incentivize the supplier to infringe or not. Our modeling, in contrast, directly builds on the Antràs literature, leaving all its essential mechanisms intact. This implies a very direct link of our empirical analysis to our theory which, in our view, thereby provides the appropriate framework for the interpretation of our empirical results.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

To rationalize this, I then build a ==== model with a collateral constraint on international borrowing. During a financial crisis, an adverse international shock reduces consumption and lowers the market value of income as collateral. The lowered income, in turn, tightens the financial constraint and sets in a debt-deflation mechanism. In this context, a fiscal expansion appreciates the ==== and drives in capital flows when the financial constraint is binding, thus creating a larger multiplier on private consumption. The difference in multipliers across financial states also depends on the exchange rate environment of a country.","Should governments increase government purchases during sudden stop crises? While stimulus packages were hastily put together at the outset of a sudden stop in many countries, the governments of others instead took the route of austerity. At the center of the debate is the uncertainty regarding the size of fiscal multipliers during small open economy financial crises. This paper investigates the state-dependent effects of government spending policy in financially distressed economies. To start, I provide cross-country evidence that the spending multiplier is higher during sudden stop recessions than in normal times. Then I build a small open economy model with a collateral constraint to demonstrate that a fiscal stimulus appreciates the real exchange rate and drives in capital flows during sudden stop crises, thereby creating stronger multiplier effects on private expenditure. The capital flow effect is due to the collateral constraint through which Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism can account for the state-dependent multipliers.====To explore the empirical relevance, I first collect a quarterly dataset of 30 open economies, with at least one sudden stop identified for each country. The sample contains most of the sudden stop events in the last four decades found in existing papers (e.g., Calvo et al., 2004). I then estimate the spending multipliers using the local projection method introduced by Jordà (2005). The shocks are identified by assuming that it takes at least one quarter for government spending to respond to innovations in economic fundamentals. The regression result shows that the consumption multiplier is close to 0 in normal times but is significantly positive during a sudden stop crisis. An increase in government purchases is also more effective in appreciating the real exchange rate and decreasing the trade balance when the shock hits during a financial crisis.====To understand the mechanism, I build an open economy framework with an external collateral constraint and downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR). The model is a two-sector economy with limited access to international financial markets. Nontradable goods are produced using labor, while the tradable endowment follows a stochastic process. Households can issue a one-period foreign-currency bond in the international market, but the total amount of borrowing is restricted by the market value of income. The form of collateral constraint is adopted from Mendoza (2002), which is widely used for studying sudden stop phenomenon and associated pecuniary externalities (e.g., Benigno et al., 2013, Bianchi, 2011, Korinek, 2018) Throughout the paper, I assume that government purchases are exogenously determined, and lump-sum taxes are always available.====The mechanism of sudden stop lies in a currency mismatch problem: international borrowing is denominated in tradable units, while part of the collateralized income comes from the nontradable sector. During economic downturns, an adverse international shock decreases tradable consumption and reduces the nontradable good price. The reduction in the value of collateral, in turn, lowers the borrowing limit and deteriorates the real absorption. As long as the financial constraint becomes binding, the financial accelerator, akin to Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism, is set in motion. That causes a vicious loop between the falling consumption demand, depreciating real exchange rate, and a sudden stop of capital inflow. The severe economic recession driven by currency devaluation is a desirable feature of the model and provides an excellent laboratory to study the effect of fiscal policies during sudden stop crises.====In this environment, an increase in government purchases helps in counteracting the debt deflation by appreciating the real exchange rate. Following a positive government spending shock, the appreciated real exchange rate boosts the market value of the collateral and relaxes the financial constraint. The enhanced borrowing ability increases the consumption of tradable goods, further pushing up the real exchange rate. Eventually, the presence of the financial constraint makes government spending policy more effective in stimulating consumption and driving in capital flows during financial crises.====I also include DNWR to examine how the above mechanism applies to economies under different exchange rate environments. DNWR has been well-documented in the existing literature. Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) show that DNWR is able to create involuntary unemployment in economic recessions, which captures an essential characteristic of SOE financial crises. In my model, for a country lacking the ability to depreciate the nominal exchange rate (peg), DNWR prevents the real wage from falling beyond some floor during a recession, and the economy is subject to the possibility of involuntary unemployment. Because wage rigidity makes an economy more demand-driven, an increase in government purchases has a stronger stimulative effect on the production of nontradable goods, leading to higher multipliers on output. However, the nominal channel also interacts with the aforementioned financial channel. After a positive spending shock, the overproduction of nontradable outputs partly offsets the appreciation of the real exchange rate and lessens the favorable effect on the collateral constraint.====Solving the model nonlinearly allows me to quantify the state-dependent effects of government spending. In the baseline environment with a floating exchange rate, the average multiplier on private consumption equals -0.39. The consumption multiplier varies greatly across states of the business cycle and negatively correlates with the GDP (with a correlation of -0.74). In addition, I simulate fiscal multipliers starting from specific states in a financial cycle. The model predicts that under the float, the consumption multiplier on impact can be greater than 0 (at 0.18) in a simulated financial crisis and is always negative (at –0.47) in economic booms. On the other hand, in the model with a pegged exchange rate, the consumption multiplier increases from 0.16 in the boom state to 0.7 in the bust state.====Overall, the model is able to reproduce several salient features that are generally consistent with the data: even without DNWR, fiscal multipliers on output and consumption are higher during sudden stop crises than in normal times, and the trade balance decreases more substantially after a positive spending shock. The presence of DNWR makes the spending policy more effective in stimulating output during the crisis, but weakens the effect on the trade balance (less negative).====In order to consider the state-contingent effects of fiscal policy on social welfare, I define a welfare multiplier. The measure indicates the influence of a one-dollar increase in government spending on people's lifetime utility, conditional on a specific state.==== On average, an increase in government purchases creates a welfare loss. The welfare multiplier is negatively correlated with GDP, implying that the welfare loss following a fiscal expansion tends to be smaller in economic downturns. More importantly, due to the improved borrowing opportunities, the welfare multiplier conditional on being in states identified as sudden stop crises is higher than its unconditional mean. Under the peg, the presence of involuntary unemployment also enlarges the welfare benefit of a positive spending shock, leading to even higher welfare multipliers during the crises.",Government spending during sudden stop crises,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000034,19 January 2022,2022,Research Article,107.0

For instance, for firms located outside of the United States, the US dollar is often used as a vehicle currency. The cost of hedging against this risk represents an additional trade cost for exporters, which is specific to the targeted destination. In this paper, we exploit an episode of heightened tensions in the USD/EUR ==== in July 2011, which increased the cost of hedging against US dollar fluctuations for French exporters. Using disaggregated information on bank balance sheets, bank-firm relationships and individual export flows for France, we show that exporters with a higher propensity to use hedging instruments reduced more their exports to “US dollar destinations” after this shock. For the average “treated” individual export flow in our sample, the increased hedging cost is equivalent to a counterfactual rise in trade costs by about 3 percentage points.","The dominant role of the US dollar in international transactions appears as an important feature of global trade. This empirical pattern has been documented in recent work based on detailed transaction data for advanced or emerging economies.==== The dominant role of the US dollar contributes to explaining important macroeconomic puzzles, such as the low pass-through of exchange rate movements into the price of internationally traded goods and inflation (Gopinath et al., 2010; Casas et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Amiti et al., 2020; Crowley et al., 2020) or the muted effects of exchange rate movements on traded volumes between countries (Boz et al., 2017; Casas et al., 2017).====We show in this paper that an increase in the cost of hedging against fluctuations in the US dollar exchange rate can have an important impact on the export performance of firms located outside of the United States but invoicing their transactions in US dollars. Invoicing exports in US dollars indeed exposes non-US exporters to a ====, as the (foreign) currency of invoicing differs from the (domestic) currency in which the firm pays for its main production costs (such as wages, taxes etc.). This problem is exacerbated in international transactions because payment is generally delayed by a few months corresponding to the shipment delays, while the terms of invoicing tend to be sticky.==== To hedge against this foreign exchange risk, some (but typically not all) exporters commonly turn to their banks to purchase hedging instruments.==== The hedging cost faced by the exporting firm is directly linked to the liquidity of the euro-dollar exchange market where banks fund the protections they sell. An increase in the cost of hedging against US dollar fluctuations is then equivalent to an increase in trade costs (a financial trade cost) affecting (i) export flows to destinations where US dollar invoicing prevails, and (ii) exporters that rely more on financial hedging instruments in normal times. This is a different mechanism compared with a classical bank lending channel, whereby the exports of a given firm would be impacted by the capacity of its bank(s) to supply credit.====Our analysis exploits a major liquidity squeeze in international interbank markets in the second half of 2011, which increased the cost of US dollar funding for ==== European banks and their clients. The sequence of events is well documented in Ivashina et al. (2015): As the euro area sovereign crisis escalated in the summer of 2011, US money market funds started to worry about the creditworthiness of European banking groups and cut their dollar-denominated exposure to European banks across the board. The resulting tensions in the euro-dollar foreign exchange market materialized in sharp deviations from the covered interest parity and the cost of dollar funding increased for all European banks.==== For their customers, the price of hedging instruments against US dollar exchange rate fluctuations (henceforth, “dollar hedging”) soared. The tensions in the EUR/USD market then abated progressively at the end of 2011 and during the first semester of 2012, as, notably, the European Central Bank adjusted downward the rate charged on its dollar lending facility (financed through the ECB's swap facility with the US Federal Reserve) in November 2011.====We investigate how this sudden increase in the cost of US dollar hedging impinged on the export performance of French exporters over the period from July 2010 to July 2012. For this purpose, we exploit two sources of heterogeneity in the data for our identification strategy: (1) Across destination markets and (2) Across exporters.====The empirical question explored in this paper has been largely overlooked so far, although anecdotal evidence suggests it is an important concern for internationally active firms.==== A plausible reason for this neglect is the difficulty to gather detailed enough data to track convincingly the effects of financial frictions in currency markets on firm-level exports. The granularity of our database allows to perform this exercise properly. Our dataset covers almost all individual banks and exporting firms in France over the period from mid-2010 to mid-2012. We collect individual information on French banks' cross-border borrowing in US dollars with US-based financial institutions and other bank balance sheet items from the French bank supervisor, and obtain the universe of credit links between resident banks and firms in France from the French credit register. We then merge this rich bank-firm information with exhaustive data on individual French exports provided by the French customs, which provides detailed information on all export flows by firm, destination and product, including, after 2011, the currency of invoicing.====Using this merged dataset, we estimate an empirical model of the growth in exports by firm, product (at the HS-4 level) and destination. The log variation of exported values, between the twelve months prior to July 2011 and the twelve months consecutive to the shock, is explained by our main variable of interest: The firm-level USD “hedging” index (our proxy for USD hedging), interacted with the share of USD invoicing in each country of destination (in the Tables: USD index ==== × USD invoicing ====). This interaction term identifies export flows (firm × destination) being more “exposed” to an increase in the USD hedging cost. We therefore expect that an increase in the US dollar hedging cost should reduce more exports in these “highly exposed” flows than in “weakly exposed” ones relying less on US dollar.====The set of selected destinations covers twelve extra-eurozone OECD countries: This choice allows to identify the effects of the rise in the USD hedging cost in the summer of 2011 on export flows across destinations with a similar level of economic development.==== These countries are however very heterogeneous as regards the invoicing practices faced by French exporters: In 2011, US dollar invoicing accounted for about 70% of aggregate French exports to the United States against about only 7% of exports to Switzerland and 15% of exports to Japan.====In all our cross-sectional regressions, which are expressed in difference before / after the shock in 2011, we include firm and country-product fixed effects. These fixed effects control for all unobserved potential firm-specific supply shocks (such as productivity shocks) and for destination-product-specific demand shocks that could additionally impact the export growth of French firms during the period of the analysis. We control for firm size (with the total value of its exports before the shock) and for two characteristics of the ==== bank-firm relationship(s), which may be correlated with the dollar-specialization of the banks: (1) The (credit-weighted) average size of the banks lending to each exporter, and (2), the number of bank relationships of each exporter. All these variables are interacted with the share of USD invoicing in each destination country. This notably wipes out the potential benefit of being connected to more banks (in terms of bargaining power with lenders) or larger, international banks for exporting with success to dollar destinations, independently of the ability of these lenders to provide cost-efficient dollar hedging instruments. Larger (more profitable) firms may also be able to absorb part of the heightened dollar hedging cost.====We find that, after July 2011, export flows that were more exposed to the heightened cost of US dollar hedging (high firm-level USD index ==== high USD invoicing in destinations) had a lower growth in exports compared to the least exposed flows. For the baseline specification, an increase in the firm-level USD “hedging” index by one standard deviation (2.3 percentage points) leads to a reduction in exports to the United States by 5.4% relative to Switzerland. For firms in the top third in the USD index (i.e. highly exposed trade flows), the drop in relative exports to the United States is about 16%, compared to least exposed flows. This finding is robust to alternative definitions of the share of dollar invoicing across destinations, measured in terms of volumes exported or of number of shipments.====We then look for heterogeneous effects across products, based on their likelihood to be invoiced in US dollar. We derive our measure of the US dollar invoicing propensity of products from a regression step where the USD invoicing dummy by firm, destination and product is explained by firm, destination, and product fixed effects. We then back-out the product fixed effects, which we use to derive the product-level USD-invoicing propensity index clean from firm and destination effects. We define “dollar products” as products having a value of the fixed effect above the mean among all product categories. We then split the estimation sample into two sub-samples, contrasting exports of products, which are less likely versus more likely to be invoiced in US dollars, whatever the destination market. We find that the overall effect of heightened dollar hedging costs on French exports in dollar-destinations is entirely driven by fluctuations in exports of dollar-invoicing-prone products (we obtain a similar result in estimations where we used an interaction term rather than estimations on sub-samples of products, see the Appendix). For such products, the impact of the shock is still significant even when the United States are excluded form the list of possible destinations. This confirms that the issue we highlight is not specific to the US market but relates more broadly to the use of US dollars in many destinations as a vehicle currency.====Additional tests confirm the robustness of our main result. In a placebo estimation, we show that the estimated impact vanishes when the timing of the shock is moved 12 months ahead of the actual shock (i.e., July 2010 instead of July 2011), which vindicates the usual parallel trends assumption. We also confirm that our findings still hold when we rely on a Propensity Score Weighting (PSW) estimator instead of ordinary least squares.====Last, we perform two additional exercises to shed light on the mechanisms underlying our results. First, we derive export prices from the available information on values and quantities (unit values) in the Customs' database and find the effect of the heightened cost of dollar hedging on export values is entirely driven by a contraction in the quantities sold, while export prices do not seem to react. Second, we exploit complementary information on firms' regular use of FX hedging instruments for the sub-sample of exporters, which is covered by the EFIGE survey of 2008. We find that the firms which reported in 2008 a regular use of specific financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations were hit harder in 2011 by the rise in the EUR/USD hedging cost, in terms of their export performance to the United States.",The real effects of invoicing exports in dollars,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199622000010,13 January 2022,2022,Research Article,108.0

The model implies that both the probability of entry and trade flows to a country are increasing in the “Diversification Index”, which depends on the multilateral covariance of the country's demand with all other markets. The risk diversification behavior can lead to higher welfare gains from trade than the ones predicted by trade models with risk neutrality. Using a panel of international sales of Portuguese firms, I estimate “risk-augmented” gravity regressions, which show that the Diversification Index significantly affects trade patterns at the extensive and intensive margins. In general equilibrium, the risk diversification channel increases welfare gains from trade by 17% relative to trade models with risk neutrality.","Recent empirical evidence has shown that demand shocks explain a large fraction of the variation in firm sales across countries (see e.g. Eaton et al., 2011; Di Giovanni et al., 2014; Munch and Nguyen, 2014; Hottman et al., 2015). When selling to a market, firms may not be able to perfectly insure against unexpected demand fluctuations. The role of demand uncertainty is particularly important in the case of costly irreversible investments, such as producing a new good or selling to a new destination (see Handley and Limao, 2015). According to a survey among 350 leading companies across the world, dealing with demand risk is the most important business challenge for global firms.==== Therefore, it is crucial to understand how demand risk affects firms behavior across markets, and evaluate its economic implications.====I provide a theoretical characterization and an empirical assessment of the importance of demand risk for firms behavior on global markets. I argue that exporting to foreign countries is an opportunity to diversify demand risk. Selling to destinations with imperfectly correlated demand can hedge firms against idiosyncratic shocks hitting sales, in the spirit of classical portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952; Sharpe, 1964). While this is an intuitive mechanism, it has not been fully explored by the macro and international trade literature. In a multi-country general equilibrium model of trade with spatially correlated demand, I characterize how firms’ risk diversification behavior affects trade patterns and study its general equilibrium implications. I quantify that the risk diversification channel explains 15% of observed trade patterns across countries, and increases welfare gains from trade by 17% relative to trade models with risk neutrality.====In the first tier of my analysis, I develop a general equilibrium trade model with monopolistic competition and heterogeneous firms, along the lines of Melitz (2003). The model is characterized by two novel elements. First, the demand for a differentiated variety is subject to country-variety shocks, which are imperfectly correlated across countries. This is the only source of uncertainty in the economy, and it can reflect shocks to tastes, consumers confidence, regulation, firm reputation, etc. Second, firms are owned by risk-averse entrepreneurs. This assumption is motivated by the evidence that the volatility of cash-flows is a primary concern for many companies across the globe, especially if the managers’ compensation is tied to the performance of the firm (see Ross, 2004; Panousi and Papanikolaou, 2012). I assume that financial markets are absent, thus the entrepreneurs cannot diversify away their idiosyncratic risk. In the limit case of no risk aversion, the model is isomorphic to standard gravity models with monopolistic competition and Pareto distributed firms’ productivities, as in Arkolakis et al. (2008) and Chaney (2008).====The production problem consists of two stages. In the first, firms know only the distribution of the demand shocks, but not their realization. Under uncertainty, they choose in which markets to operate, and perform costly marketing and distributional activities. In the second stage, firms learn the consumers’ demand and produce, but they cannot change their set of destinations.====The spatial correlation of demand across countries implies that, in the investment stage, entrepreneurs face a combinatorial problem, since both the extensive and the intensive margin decisions are interdependent across markets. I overcome this challenge by assuming that firms send costly ads in each country where they want to sell. These activities allow firms to reach a fraction ==== of the consumers in each location, in the spirit of Arkolakis (2010). This implies that the firm's choice variable is continuous rather than discrete, and firms simultaneously choose where to sell (depending on whether ==== is optimally zero or positive) and how much to sell (firms can choose to sell only to a fraction of the consumers). Therefore, the firm's extensive and intensive margin decisions are not taken independently for each market, as in standard trade models, but instead performing a global diversification strategy, which trades off the expected global profits with their variance.====I characterize the model-consistent exogenous measure of risk, which I name “Diversification Index.” This variable measures the diversification benefits that a market provides to all firms exporting there, and it depends on the entire pattern of spatial covariance of demand across countries. I show that the probability of entering a market and the intensity of trade flows are increasing in the market's Diversification Index. If demand in a country is relatively stable and negatively/mildly correlated with demand in the other countries, then entrepreneurs optimally choose, ====, to export more there to hedge their business risk. This implies a fundamental trade-off: selling to a more remote destination may require higher trade and marketing costs, but it may also hedge firms against domestic fluctuations in demand.====In a two-country version of the model, I provide an analytical characterization of the welfare gains from trade. When the covariance of demand between the two countries is sufficiently low, firms use more intensively international trade to hedge their domestic demand risk. This implies a stronger competitive pressure among firms, which in general equilibrium generates a pro-competitive effect which can lead to higher welfare gains from trade than in standard trade models with risk neutrality, such as the class of models considered in Arkolakis et al. (2012) (ACR henceforth).====To assess the quantitative relevance of the risk diversification benefits of international trade, and test the model's predictions, I rely on a panel dataset of Portuguese manufacturing firms’ domestic and international sales, from 1995 to 2005. Portugal exports to a wide range of destinations, and therefore is a good laboratory to study the implications of risk diversification for international trade.====First, I structurally recover the unobserved demand shocks from yearly firm-destination sales. I identify the demand shocks as innovations from the growth rate of domestic and international sales, similarly to Di Giovanni et al. (2014). The empirical methodology controls for unobserved firm and destination characteristics, and for firm-destination observables, which account for the firms’ endogenous response to foreign demand shocks documented by a recent literature (Mayer et al., 2016; Friedrich et al., 2018. Under the assumption of log-normally distributed demand, routinely maintained by the literature (see e.g. Cochrane, 2009; Eaton et al., 2011), I estimate the country-level means and covariance matrix of the demand shocks, and compute the Diversification Index. Using the Portuguese firm-level data, I estimate “risk-augmented” gravity regressions at the firm and country level, which document that both the extensive and intensive margins of trade, even after controlling for standard gravity variables, are significantly affected by the Diversification Index, as predicted by my model.====In the second part of the analysis, I use the structural model to quantify the risk diversification benefits of international trade. First, I calibrate the remaining parameters of the model. Using the firm's first order conditions, I estimate the entrepreneurs's risk aversion in the cross-section of Portuguese firms. The implied “risk premium” is large, lending support to the assumption that entrepreneurs are risk averse. The structural calibration suggests that, overall, the risk diversification motive explains 15% of the observed variation in trade flows. Second, I follow Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare (2013) and compute the welfare gains of going from autarky, i.e. a world where trade costs are infinitely high, to the observed trade equilibrium in 2005. The results illustrate that welfare gains from trade in my model with risk-averse firms are typically larger than the gains predicted by risk neutral models. In relative terms, welfare gains in my model are, for the median country, 17% higher than in ACR. Therefore, the effect of risk diversification on welfare gains is quantitatively relevant.====A strand of literature (Helpman and Razin, 1978; Anderson, 1981; Newbery and Stiglitz, 1984; Helpman, 1988) has analyzed the effect of financial markets incompleteness on international trade under production uncertainty. While this old literature (recently revived by the works of Koren (2003), Kucheryavyy (2014), Ghironi and Wolfe (2018) and Heiland (2019)) has focused on the relationship between asset markets and international trade under uncertainty, I study the diametrically opposite case where financial markets are absent and analyze the role of international trade as a tool to diversify the demand uncertainty faced by uninsured exporters.====A more recent quantitative literature has studied the role of uncertainty for international trade and welfare, such as Rob and Vettas (2003), Impullitti et al. (2013), Fillat and Garetto (2015), Allen and Atkin (2016). My contribution relative to this literature is twofold. First, while it typically focuses either on the volatility as measure of risk (see e.g. Vannoorenberghe et al., 2016; Kramarz et al., 2020; De Sousa et al., 2020), or on the covariance between the exporter stock returns and the importer's aggregate demand (see e.g. Fillat and Garetto, 2015; Barrot et al., 2019; Heiland, 2019), or on the covariance between domestic and foreign shocks (see e.g. Ria no, 2011; Ramondo et al., 2013), my paper highlights the importance of the ==== covariance of demand across countries, captured by the Diversification Index, in shaping international trade flows and welfare. Second, I provide a novel characterization of the welfare gains from trade as a function of demand risk, and determine, after a structural estimation, its quantitative importance in general equilibrium. Thus the paper innovates also with respect to the literature that examines the determinants of the welfare gains from trade, see e.g. Arkolakis et al. (2012) and Melitz and Redding (2015).====A vast literature, across several fields, has proposed different measures of uncertainty and studied their impact on the economy. These include proxies based on, among others, stock prices (Bloom, 2009), newspaper coverage (Baker et al., 2016), tariffs (Pierce and Schott, 2016), GDP volatility (Koren and Tenreyro, 2007), consumption volatility (Boguth and Kuehn, 2013). The Diversification Index proposed in this paper captures a distinct aspect of uncertainty compared to existing measures, as it takes into account for the entire pattern of spatial covariance of demand across countries.====This paper also relates to the broad literature that studies the determinants of trade patterns. Theoretically, previous models of firms’ export decision have typically assumed that exporters make independent entry decisions for each destination market - see Melitz (2003), Chaney (2008) and Helpman et al. (2008a) among others. In contrast, in my model entry in a market depends on the global diversification strategy of the firm, which I characterize despite its inherent complexity. Other existing works, such as Ahn and McQuoid (2017), Lind and Ramondo (2018) and Morales et al. (2019), feature interdependence of exporting decisions across markets, but arising from supply-side forces, rather than from demand linkages. Empirically, while the existing literature has highlighted the importance of firm-destination shocks for the cross-sectional variation of sales (see e.g. Di Giovanni et al., 2014; Hottman et al., 2015; Eaton et al., 2011), a distinct contribution of this paper is to document that the spatial correlation of such shocks has important consequences for trade patterns.====Lastly, the paper complements the strand of literature that studies the effect of international trade on macroeconomic volatility. Di Giovanni et al. (2014) and di Giovanni et al. (2018) investigate the role of individual firms in international business cycle co-movement and aggregate volatility. di Giovanni and Levchenko (2009) and Caselli et al. (2020) study the effect of trade openness on aggregate output volatility. My paper, in contrast, sheds light on the other direction, i.e. how demand risk affects international trade patterns through the firms’ risk diversification behavior.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the general equilibrium model with risk aversion. In Section 3 I estimate the Diversification Index and test its role in shaping trade flows. In Section 4 I calibrate the model and perform the counterfactual exercise, while Section. 5 concludes.",Demand risk and diversification through international trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199621001422,3 January 2022,2022,Research Article,109.0

Our key finding is that a trade-induced increase in market concentration can be an important source of the gains from trade. Foreign competition puts downward pressure on profitability which reduces the equilibrium number of firms, but increases their size. This rise in concentration increases welfare via two channels: increasing returns in production, and a scale effect on innovation. In a calibrated version of the model we show that concentration is a main driver of the gains from trade, mostly via its stimulating effect on innovation – the contribution of increasing returns is small. Moreover, lowering trade costs reduce the inefficiency produced by “reciprocal dumping”, leading to substantial gains. In contrast, the associated reduction in markup dispersion has only a negligible effect.","Modern economies are dominated by a few global firms that are large, highly productive, and have substantial market power. The top one percent of US exporters account for more than 80% of total US trade (Bernard et al., 2018), and their market power varies both in the cross-sectional and time dimension (e.g. Hottman, 2016, Loecker et al., 2020).==== Large firms are also found to be key players in “innovation-races” with the objective to increase their market shares in the global economy (e.g. Bustos, 2011, Aghion and Bergeaud, 2017). Standard models of international trade with heterogeneous firms, however, do not usually capture the market structure and the strategic nature of competition amongst these large players.====To analyze such markets populated by large players, where technology is at the root of firms competitiveness, it is critical to incorporate powerful firms that interact strategically. In this paper we study the welfare gains from trade and their sources in an economy with heterogeneous, oligopolistic, firms where both technology and market structure are endogenously determined. The response of technology and market structure to lowering trade barriers shapes the welfare impact of globalisation.====We consider a global economy with two symmetric countries producing the same set of varieties of differentiated goods. Each variety is produced by a small number of domestic and foreign firms engaged in Cournot competition for market shares. Hence, within each variety there is two-way trade in identical goods as in Krugman (1983). Productivity differs across varieties, but the small number of firms competing head-to-head in each variety has identical productivity. Entry occurs at the variety-, or product line-, level and determines the number of operating (domestic and foreign) firms. Markups are endogenous and affected by trade barriers as well as the number of firms competing in each product line. After entry, firms allocate resources to production and innovation. Since innovation reduces the firms’ unit cost, the associated benefits are larger the larger is the scale of the firms’ production. Hence, market size drives firms’ decision to innovate.====Multilateral trade liberalization has the following effects on the key endogenous variables. Domestic markups decline via the typical pro-competitive effect, while export markups increase, as firms do not fully pass on the reduction in the cost of accessing the foreign market to consumers. Abstracting from entry, the pro-competitive effect dominates, and firms’ average markups decline with trade liberalization. With free entry, however, the pro-competitive effect – provided it is strong enough – may lead to an increase in market concentration as the associated reduction in profitability lowers the equilibrium number of firms.==== Higher concentration, in turn, can more than offset the pro-competitive effect, leading to higher markups both on domestic and export sales. Moreover, in more concentrated markets, firms are larger and therefore have stronger incentives to innovate.====These outcomes shape a rich set of channels through which trade can affect welfare. By redistributing market shares across firms with different markups, trade impacts ====; a typical source of distortions in this class of models. Changes in the ====, instead, are not distortionary, as labor is supplied inelastically. The average markup can only affect welfare indirectly via entry: increased trade squeezes profit margins, forcing a reduction in the number of firms which, in turn, leads to efficiency gains via ==== and ====. The presence of a fixed operating cost implies that with a smaller number of firms there is less labor “wasted” on the fixed cost, and more labor available for variable production and innovation. A further source of gains from trade comes from the reduction in the resources wasted paying an iceberg-cost to trade identical goods. This is the ==== channel emphasised by Krugman (1983). Lastly, we provide a formula that transparently separates the welfare gains from trade into these channels: increasing returns, innovation, variable markups, and the inefficiency associated with two-way trade in identical goods.====The model is solved numerically and calibrated to match some relevant firm-level and aggregate statistics of the U.S. economy. In our baseline simulations, the effect of entirely eliminating trade costs has a heterogenous impact. In about half of the product lines the pro-competitive effect dominates, markups decline, and concentration as well as innovation are unchanged. For the other half, the number of firms in each product line drops, markets become more concentrated, markups increase, and firms become larger and more innovative. The effects on the aggregate economy can be broken down in two phases of liberalization. In the first phase, when the trade cost is reduced by about 30%, the average number of firms declines, while markups, concentration and innovation increase. From there to free trade, concentration and innovation do not change further and the average markup of the economy declines.====We compute the welfare gains from trade and decompose them into their key channels. Quantitatively, going from our benchmark variable trade cost – which is an iceberg cost of 21% – to free trade generates a welfare gain of about a 10% in consumption equivalents. Most of this gain is split between the reciprocal dumping and the innovation channel, while the gains from increasing returns are small, and the contribution of markup dispersion is negligible. In the first phase of globalisation, where concentration is increasing, gains from trade are mostly driven by innovation, while in the second phase, reciprocal dumping is instead the key driver. These quantitative results are produced by the specific parametrisation used, but the more general insight is that the competition effect of trade can operate via increasing concentration and have important welfare implications.","Technology, market structure and the gains from trade",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199621001379,29 December 2021,2021,Research Article,110.0
Uribe Martín,"Department of Economics, Columbia University, 420 West 118th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA","Received 13 June 2019, Revised 17 November 2021, Accepted 18 December 2021, Available online 27 December 2021, Version of Record 10 January 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2021.103560,Cited by (4),"This paper shows that in a new Keynesian model of the open economy with portfolio adjustment costs a permanent increase in the nominal interest rate causes in the short run a depreciation of the nominal and real exchange rates and a deviation from uncovered interest rate parity against the tightening country. These effects have the opposite sign than those associated with transitory increases in the nominal interest rate. The paper then estimates an empirical model of exchange rates and uncovered interest rate differentials with permanent and transitory U.S. monetary policy shocks on post-Bretton-Woods data from the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada. The estimated impulse responses to permanent monetary shocks are shown to be qualitatively consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model.","After years of exceptionally low policy rates central banks around the world are beginning to contemplate lifting them to historically more normal levels. For open economies this raises the question of whether and how interest rate normalization affects exchange rates, cross-country return differentials, inflation, and aggregate activity. A common fear among policy makers is that interest rate normalization carries the risk of currency appreciation, hot-money capital inflows, deflation, and economic contraction. In this regard, a limitation of the existing literature on open economy monetary economics is that to a large extent it restricts attention to transitory monetary shocks and is therefore ill suited to analyze the effects of permanent movements in policy rates like the ones that policy normalization would demand. The present paper aims to overcome this limitation by studying the effects of temporary and permanent monetary shocks in open economies.====The analysis is both empirical and theoretical. The empirical framework is an open-economy extension of the latent-variable model with permanent and temporary monetary shocks introduced by Uribe (forthcoming). The domestic country is taken to be the United States and the foreign country the United Kingdom, Japan, or Canada. The U.S. permanent monetary shock is identified by assuming that it is cointegrated with U.S. inflation and the U.S. nominal interest rate. In addition to U.S. transitory and permanent monetary shocks, the empirical model features a foreign permanent monetary shock. Like in the United States, in the foreign country the nominal interest rate and inflation are assumed to be cointegrated. Unlike in the United States, however, in the foreign country the common permanent component of inflation and interest rates is a linear combination of the U.S. and foreign permanent monetary shocks. This assumption defines the U.S. central bank as a monetary authority with potentially a global impact. Its impact on each country is estimated. This specification nests as polar cases one in which there is a single global permanent monetary shock (originating in the United States) and one in which the permanent component of inflation and nominal rates in the foreign country is independent of the U.S. permanent monetary shock. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods on data covering the period 1974Q1 to 2018Q1.====The paper finds that transitory increases in the U.S. nominal interest rate cause short-run appreciation of the domestic currency, which is in line with the results of earlier studies. By contrast, monetary shocks that increase U.S. interest rates and inflation in the long run are found to cause a nominal and real depreciation of the U.S. dollar already in the short run. This suggests that information on whether movements in nominal interest rates are driven by permanent or transitory monetary shocks is key to predicting the direction in which the exchange rate will move. Further the empirical analysis suggests that a transitory increase in the interest rate lowers inflation and output, whereas a permanent increase in rates is inflationary and non-contractionary. This last result echoes earlier findings in closed economy versions of the present model by Uribe (forthcoming) and Azevedo et al. (2019).====The distinction between transitory and permanent monetary shocks also has important consequences for the dynamics of uncovered interest rate differentials. As in the related empirical literature, a transitory increase in the nominal interest rate causes a short-run departure from uncovered interest rate parity in favor of domestic assets. By contrast, a permanent increase in the nominal interest rate causes a departure from uncovered interest rate parity against domestic assets. This result suggests that carry-trade speculation conditional on monetary shocks may have different pay-offs than is implied by estimates that do not distinguish permanent from transitory shocks.====The estimated empirical model predicts that domestic and foreign permanent monetary shocks jointly explain a significant fraction of the forecast error variance of the nominal and real exchange rate and uncovered interest rate differentials at horizons of 1 to 4 years, while transitory monetary shocks are found to matter less, playing an insignificant role in most estimations.====A further contribution of the paper is to show that the sharp differences in the responses of exchange rates and uncovered interest rate differentials to transitory and permanent monetary shocks predicted by the estimated empirical model can be rationalized by an optimizing open economy model with nominal rigidities and financial frictions. Nominal rigidities allow for monetary shocks to have effects not only on nominal but also on real exchange rates. Financial frictions allow for equilibrium deviations from uncovered interest rate parity. In the theoretical model we consider, nominal rigidities take the form of Calvo-type price stickiness as in Galí and Monacelli (2005) and financial frictions take the form of portfolio adjustment costs as in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2021).====The intuition for why a monetary shock that leads to an increase in the nominal interest rate in the long run depreciates the nominal exchange rate already in the short run is that it is a harbinger of higher future inflation. Being a forward looking asset price, the current exchange rate factors in these inflationary expectations as they arrive. The prediction that a rise in the policy rate is associated with a depreciation of the exchange rate in the short run represents an open economy manifestation of the neo Fisher effect. By contrast, a purely transitory monetary tightening causes an appreciation of the nominal exchange rate by the standard Dornbusch (1976) mechanism. We show, however, that the appreciation in response to a transitory monetary shock turns into a depreciation when the shock becomes sufficiently persistent.====In the theoretical model, the effects of transitory and permanent monetary policy shocks on the uncovered interest rate differential are determined by a tradeoff between intertemporal and intratemporal consumption substitution. When the intratemporal elasticity exceeds the intertemporal elasticity of consumption substitution, which is the case most commonly studied in international business cycle analysis, permanent monetary tightenings lead to uncovered interest rate differentials against the high interest rate currency and transitory tightenings move them in favor of the high interest rate currency. These effects are in line with those predicted by the empirical model. However, the theoretical model predicts the opposite when the intertemporal elasticity of consumption substitution exceeds the intratemporal one.====This paper is related to a large body of work on the effects of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates and cross-country return differentials. Monetary policy shocks have been identified in the context of international empirical models using a variety of methods including recursive identification (Eichenbaum and Evans, 1995), structural vector autoregression models (Kim and Roubini, 2000, Faust and Rogers, 2003, Bjørnland, 2009), sign restrictions (Scholl and Uhlig, 2008, Kim et al., 2017), high-frequency identification (Faust et al., 2003, Inoue and Rossi, 2019), and the Romer and Romer narrative approach (Eichenbaum and Evans, 1995, Hettig et al., 2019). The two main conclusions that have emerged from this body of work are: First, the domestic currency appreciates in response to a tightening in domestic monetary policy. Second, a domestic monetary tightening causes a persistent deviation from uncovered interest rate parity in favor of domestic interest-bearing assets. This paper contributes to this literature by showing that the response of exchange rates and uncovered interest rate differentials to a monetary shock depends crucially on whether the shock is transitory or permanent.====A related paper that also considers the effects of permanent monetary disturbances on the exchange rate is De Michelis and Iacoviello (2016). These authors find, consistent with the empirical results reported in the present paper, that in response to an increase in the U.S. inflation target, the U.S. real exchange rate temporarily depreciates. Unlike the present study, this paper does not analyze the effects of monetary policy shocks on nominal exchange rates or uncovered interest rate differentials. In addition, it does not jointly estimate the effects of temporary and permanent monetary disturbances. To the best of our knowledge the present study represents the first attempt to implement this distinction in the context of an international empirical and theoretical model and to document that it has significant consequences for the dynamics of exchange rates and excess returns.====More broadly, the present paper is also related to empirical papers on foreign exchange risk premia. Engel (2016) estimates a vector error correction system in the nominal exchange rate, the cross country price-level differential, and the nominal interest-rate differential and extracts the permanent component of the nominal exchange rate. Hassan and Mano (2019) find that correcting for uncertainty about future mean interest rates yields that the hypothesis that high interest rate currencies are expected to depreciate cannot be rejected. Mueller et al. (2017) document that daily returns on currency portfolios increase on FOMC announcement days. Zhang (2020) and Wiriadinata (2020), respectively, document that the shares of dollar-invoiced imports and dollar-denominated external debt are significant determinants of spillovers of U.S. monetary shocks on exchange rates.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 characterizes theoretically the effects of temporary and permanent monetary shocks in a new-Keynesian open economy model with deviations from uncovered interest rate parity. Section 3 presents the empirical model and the identification scheme. Section 4 explains the estimation procedure. Section 5 presents the estimated responses of exchange rates and interest rate differentials to permanent and transitory monetary shocks. Section 6 performs forecast error variance decompositions to document the importance of permanent monetary shocks as drivers of nominal and real exchange rates and uncovered interest rate differentials.

Finally, we show that integration increases the similarity of bank lending fluctuations between states and contributes to the transmission of deposit shocks across states.","This paper analyzes the effect of financial integration through banks across U.S. states on the co-movement of economic activity. To identify the causal effect of banking integration on output synchronization, we exploit the removal of restrictions to interstate banking to construct instrumental variables. We also provide new insights on the channels and analyze heterogeneity across states and industries and show how integration affects lending and the transmission of bank funding shocks.====The effect of financial integration on output synchronization between regions is theoretically ambiguous and depends on the nature of the shocks that drive economic fluctuations.==== A negative real (e.g productivity) shock in a region may lead multi-market banks to shift lending to non-affected regions, causing a further divergence in economic activity, which reduces output synchronization.==== If multi-market banks, however, face a negative financial (e.g funding) shock in one market they may also cut lending in other markets, affecting economic activity in regions not directly hit by the initial shock negatively, which increases output synchronization.====Identifying the causal effect of financial integration (through banks) on output synchronization is empirically difficult. Unobservable time-varying factors, for instance, may jointly determine financial integration and output co-movement between regions. Banks also choose where and when to expand and this expansion decision might be correlated with the level of or changes in output synchronization between regions.====Empirical evidence on the effect of financial integration on output co-movement is somewhat mixed====: Morgan et al. (2004) find that banking integration across U.S. states correlates positively with the co-movement of economic activity. Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2013b) focus on Europe and find a negative link between integration and synchronization when controlling for unobservable time-invariant factors at the country-pair.====We start our analysis using panel data at the state-pair level from 1976 to 1994 and also find mixed effects regarding the relationship between banking integration and output synchronization in OLS regressions.==== Some specifications indicate a positive, yet insignificant, association between integration and output synchronization. This finding is not robust and we find a negative relationship between integration and output co-movement when using other variable definitions. As discussed earlier, OLS estimates are likely to be biased and thus do not represent a causal relationship.====We identify the causal effect of banking integration across U.S. states on output synchronization by exploiting the removal of restrictions to interstate banking to construct time-varying instrumental variables (IV) at the state-pair level. Restrictions on interstate banking prohibited entry from out-of-state bank holding companies (BHC) for much of the 20th century in the U.S.==== Starting in the late 1970s, states gradually removed these restrictions, allowing BHCs to expand across states. The Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 eliminated all remaining barriers to interstate banking at the federal level.==== The removal of these entry restrictions had a direct effect on financial integration between states as banks could expand across states once these barriers were removed (Goetz et al., 2013; Landier et al., 2017).==== Earlier work suggests that there are good economic reasons for treating the process of interstate banking deregulation as exogenous to state economic conditions (Kroszner and Strahan, 1999). We also find no evidence that the level of and changes in output co-movement are correlated with the timing of interstate banking deregulation.====Using our IV strategy, we find a strong and positive effect of banking integration on output synchronization. This finding is robust to different specifications, other measures of synchronization and economically significant: a one-standard deviation increase in the share of assets and deposits held by BHCs with operations in both states increases output co-movement, measured by the negative absolute difference in residual real GDP growth between states, of about 20% of its standard deviation.====To better understand why financial integration increases output synchronization we provide three novel analyses. First, we show that the effect of financial integration depends on the underlying (real or financial) shock. Second, we utilize data on industry output within states and find that output co-movement of industries with a high dependence on external finance responds stronger to financial integration. Third, we further document that the effect of integration on output synchronization of industries with high financial dependence differs when states face real or financial shocks.====To estimate the effect of financial integration when states experience different shocks we first identify (a) states that face financial shocks, proxied by the extent of bank failures in a state and year, and (b) states that face real shocks, proxied by the monetary losses due to natural disasters.==== Consistent with the idea that banks transmit shocks across regions, we find that banking integration has a larger effect on output synchronization when at least one of the states in the pair faces significant bank failures.====We also examine differences in output co-movement within a state and explore if the synchronization of certain industries' output responds more when states become financially integrated. We find that banking integration has a stronger effect on output synchronization for industries that depend on external finance. This holds if we analyze differential changes in synchronization within a state-pair and year by including state-pair specific time fixed effects. Finally, we test if this stronger effect of integration for financially dependent industries differs when states face real or financial shocks. If multi-market banks transmit financial shocks across states then we expect that integration within a state-pair has a stronger effect on synchronization of financially dependent industries when states experience financial shocks. Our findings confirm this.====To our knowledge, we are the first (1) to assess how the effect of financial integration on output synchronization differs depending on whether regions face financial or real shocks,==== (2) to analyze whether the effect of financial integration on output co-movement differs across industries and (3) to document that this industry-specific effect varies within a state-pair when states experience financial shocks.====Our findings are consistent with the idea that multi-state banks transmit shocks through internal capital markets, creating a commonality in lending among states which then increases output synchronization.==== To examine this mechanism, we analyze whether banking integration increases the similarity of bank lending fluctuations between states. Indeed, we find that banking integration increases the co-movement of business lending between states.====Finally, we analyze whether banking integration contributes to the transmission of funding shocks and examine whether fluctuations in deposit funding in one state affect lending in (other) financially integrated states. If multi-state banks transmit funding shocks through internal capital markets, then we would expect aggregate bank lending in a state to respond to changes in aggregate deposits in other states with which that state is financially integrated. Analyzing this empirically is difficult, as states that are financially integrated may face common shocks, affecting both deposits and loans. We build on Goetz et al., 2013, Goetz et al., 2016 and exploit the process of interstate banking deregulation to construct IVs to recover the exogenous component of deposit growth in financially integrated states. We find that lending in a state responds positively to deposit changes in other states with which it is integrated.====Our paper contributes to a large literature, described above, that analyzes the effect of financial integration on the synchronization of economic activity by (1) identifying the causal effect of banking integration on output co-movement using an IV strategy, (2) showing that the effect of integration varies across industries, and (3) depends on the idiosyncratic shock faced by regions. Furthermore, we present additional novel evidence on aggregate bank behavior and show that integration (1) fosters the co-movement of bank lending between states and (2) contributes to the transmission of funding shocks across states.====This paper is also related to a large literature that studies the effects of banking deregulation in the U.S. Earlier research shows that intrastate and interstate banking deregulation is associated with higher economic growth, improved financing for small firms, and an acceleration in business formation.==== One mechanism that could account for some of these findings is increased capital mobility across states following deregulation as suggested by our findings. Our paper is also related to a growing literature, analyzing how multi-market banks in the U.S. transmit local shocks to funding and to credit demand across markets.==== We do not focus on the transmission of particular shocks through banks' pre-existing geographic networks here, but rather look at the aggregate effect of banking integration between states, while accounting for the endogeneity of banking integration.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, variable definitions and sample. Section 3 presents findings from OLS and 2SLS estimation, where we use the state-pair specific timing in the removal of interstate banking restrictions as an excluded instrument for banking integration. Section 4 presents analyses exploiting heterogeneity across states and industries. Section 5 focuses on the effect of banking integration on the co-movement of bank lending and the transmission of bank funding shocks across states.

Applied to ====, we show that unexpected changes in world prices or skill biased technological change can induce a surge in economic nationalism and trade protection. Over time, the initial protectionist surge will gradually diminish if and only if educational gains enable less-skilled workers to catch up with the overall economy. The more unequal the initial distribution of the returns to human capital, the greater and longer-lasting the protectionist backlash will be: unequal gains, prolonged pain. Key data markers suggested by the model exhibit patterns consistent with recent surges in protectionism in the US and UK.","Globalization has suffered a spate of democratic rebukes in recent years, not least the UK ‘Brexit’ vote and the US presidential election of trade-skeptic Donald Trump in 2016. This rise in economic nationalism has vexed globalization's cheerleaders who are quick to point out that despite individual losses for some, the aggregate gains from trade and immigration are demonstrably positive and, moreover, that technological change is at least as responsible as foreign competition in driving job losses and economic dislocation in industrialized countries. However accurate they may be, these arguments fail to address two key forces underpinning today's protectionist groundswell: labor market frictions and rising inequality, which together feed popular support for nationalist economic policies despite the aggregate gains from globalization. This paper incorporates both factors into a workhorse dynamic political economy model to gain new insight on the drivers and consequences of protectionism.====We show that when economic adjustment is slow and the gains from openness are skewed toward the top, protectionist surges may be a natural and long-lasting democratic response to unanticipated macroeconomic shocks. Crucially, this prediction holds even when those shocks deliver immediate aggregate welfare gains; even when those gains will eventually be shared by a majority of voters; even when the shocks are driven by technology instead of trade; and even in the presence of redistributive income taxes and transfers. The explantation is fundamentally one of timing mis-match: structural change takes time, but politics can change quickly. Even if most workers eventually would be ‘winners’ from more open borders following a macroeconomic shock, many will suffer in the short run because labor market frictions hamper their potential to respond to changes in the global marketplace. In the immediate aftermath of a labor market shock, adversely-affected workers thus may resort to using nationalist economic policies to boost market demand for their labor. Remedial protectionism in turn slows the subsequent process of economic adjustment, and therefore future political choices, with long-lasting welfare consequences.====The core of our paper formalizes this insight by developing a dynamic political economy model to identify the short and long-run consequences of labor market frictions in a responsive democratic political environment. We consider unanticipated changes in the terms of trade and skill-biased technological change, and show that the sharp democratic reactions to these macroeconomic shocks may impose long-lasting efficiency costs by distorting future economic decisions. We then use the model to evaluate the extent to which domestic economic policies (including income taxes, universal basic income, or education) or multilateral trade agreements will soften or sharpen the political consequences of macroeconomic shocks. A final section of the paper explores the recent Brexit and ‘America First’ phenomena through the lens of our model.====Our framework provides a new model for understanding contemporary trade policy, distinct from the well understood “Protection for Sale” theory pioneered by Grossman and Helpman (1994). While there is substantial evidence that special interest lobbying played a central role in shaping trade policy for much of modern history,==== the same explanations are incomplete in the context of today's populist protectionism, which is generally at odds with corporate interests. By emphasizing the role of popular politics in the presence of wage inequality, labor market frictions, and rapid technological and global market changes, our model delivers predictions consistent with recent experience. Our findings also complement important recent evidence on the role of trade in exacerbating identity politics:==== to the extent that rising economic vulnerability exacerbates underlying group allegiances, then trade and technology shocks may trigger rising polarization in political identity, consistent with the recent findings of Autor et al. (2020) in response to the terms-of-trade ‘China Shock’.====At the same time, the key insights of this paper also apply beyond today's surge in economic nationalism. We tailor our model to address the recent surge in protectionism, but the basic insight is more general: differential frictions between economic and political change can induce sharp political swings with long-lasting consequences. Both this idea and the general theoretical mechanisms that we highlight are readily applicable to other policy contexts, including climate change, immigration, and tax or entitlement reform. As we demonstrate formally through the specific lens of our model, the interplay between slow economic adjustment and rapid political response can generate rich, non-monotonic transition dynamics. This insight offers a political-economy analog to the seminal Dornbusch (1976) finding, that the marriage of sticky prices with immediate adjustment of market expectations generates non-monotonic exchange rate “overshooting” dynamics.====Our model features a small open economy with overlapping generations of heterogenous workers who make endogenous human capital investments. In each generation, young workers form rational expectations over the future (exogenous) macroeconomic environment and (endogenous) policy outcomes. We model the policy instrument as a tariff, which generates a clear tradeoff between aggregate welfare and the distribution of income. Policy is determined by majoritarian voting according to a median voter rule in the tradition of Mayer (1984).==== We consider permanent exogenous shocks to the terms of trade and skill-biased technology, which we show can have commensurate political consequences. We focus on the empirically relevant scenario in which a macroeconomic shock increases aggregate income, but with benefits accruing disproportionately to the most skilled, highest income individuals.====The theoretical analysis yields three key insights. First, differences in the potential speed of adjustment between economic and political change lead to sharp policy changes: as long as politics can respond to a shock more quickly than labor markets can adjust, the response to an unexpected macroeconomic shock will be an immediate increase in protectionism – even if the eventual outcome will be ==== tariffs. This immediate surge in protectionism will slow the subsequent process of political and economic adjustment by blunting the incentive for younger workers to acquire human capital.====Second, skewness in the distribution of human capital plays a critical role in both the short and long run. At the time of the shock, greater inequality in trade exposure leads to a sharper initial protectionist surge and thus a longer and more costly adjustment process. In the long run, economic inequality is endogenous and depends on whether or not education allows adversely-affected workers to ‘catch up’ to the rest of the economy. If workers can catch up, then the optimistic ==== scenario ensues. Although the adjustment process takes time, it exhibits a virtuous cycle: as education rises, economic inequality falls, which increases support for trade; lower tariffs then induce further educational investment, leading to still-lower inequality and greater support for trade, and so on. Alternatively, it is entirely possible that the shock will exacerbate the underlying skewness in the distribution of the returns to human capital, even after workers have had time to upgrade their skill sets. Under this scenario, the initial shock will induce a greater increase in the returns to human capital at the top of the distribution than at the bottom, and the long run equilibrium will be characterized by ====: after the initial protectionist surge, inequality rises despite increasing education levels, and the tariff will climb via an oscillating transition path, converging to a higher steady state level.====Third, skill-biased technological change can mimic the effects of a terms-of-trade improvement in triggering a protectionist backlash. To the extent that both technological shocks and global market shocks can drive up the skewness in the returns to human capital, they will have commensurate political effects in our model. Thus, a populist backlash against globalization could be caused by technology, not trade; even if automation were ==== responsible for today's increasing economic inequality, the political consequences for globalization may be the same. More broadly, anything that increases dispersion in the distribution of earnings can sharpen voters’ incentives to tilt market wages in their favor, using trade policy or other means. In a democracy, economic nationalism may be a natural and inevitable consequence.====We then use the model to evaluate the extent to which protectionist surges are exacerbated or dampened by other domestic economic policies. We show that progressive income taxes or unconditional redistribution (e.g. universal basic income) will not eliminate protectionism, even if they reduce income inequality: as long as some part of workers’ earnings are linked to market wages, voters will have an incentive to manipulate trade in order to boost demand for their own labor. At the same time, progressive taxes and conditional transfers risk discouraging investment in education (as do tariffs on imports of low-skill goods). Education subsidies or reforms are more promising. They can both encourage human capital formation and reduce protectionist pressure, but only if they induce convergence in the distribution of human capital. To the extent that education policies increase human capital disproportionately among those workers already at the top of the distribution, they may only worsen political polarization and, thus, protectionism. In a separate extension, the model highlights the importance of escape clauses in multilateral trade rules. Absent safeguard flexibilities, a short-term protectionist spike could lead to a permanent trade war.====The last section of the paper offers empirical context for our theoretical analysis through the lens of two recent phenomena: Brexit in the UK and the Trump Trade War in the US. Theory suggests that two economic conditions may serve as potential harbingers of a surge in economic nationalism. The first condition is that that the returns to human capital are concentrated at the top. The second condition is that labor market adjustment is “sticky”. Though by no means perfect measures, we use trends in mean and median household (gross) income to proxy the first condition, and we use intergenerational earnings elasticities for the second. Data on both indicators suggest that the US and UK are outliers relative to otherwise comparable OECD countries: economic inequality and intergenerational income immobility are highest where economic nationalism recently won electoral success under Brexit and Trump. We discuss the extent to which these recent protectionist surges do – and do not – square with our theory. Finally, we identify the conditions under which protectionism may decline (‘overshooting’) or rise (‘escalation’) in the future, according to our model.====The paper proceeds as follows. The next section reviews the important and diverse related literature that precedes us. Section 3 then presents our model and characterizes economic and political steady states. Section 4 examines the transition dynamics following a large permanent terms-of-trade shock and, in an immediate extension, demonstrates the nearly isomorphic effects of skill-biased technological change. In Section 5, we use the model to shed light on domestic and multilateral policies that may exacerbate or mitigate populist protectionist surges. Section 6 discusses recent protectionist episodes in the US and the UK in the context of the model, and Section 7 concludes.","Unequal gains, prolonged pain: A model of protectionist overshooting and escalation",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199621001392,21 December 2021,2021,Research Article,113.0

U.S. loan-level data show that a 10 percent depreciation of the local currency quarter-to-quarter increases the probability that a firm becomes past due on its loans by 42 basis points for firms with foreign currency debt relative to those with local currency debt. This increase is economically significant, given a baseline probability of 20 basis points, and indicates that ==== of borrowers can translate into credit risk for banks. Firms are more likely to borrow in foreign currency if they belong to ==== that generate more income abroad and if a ==== deviation makes foreign currency loans cheaper. The paper establishes additional facts on large U.S. banks’ international corporate loan portfolios, offering a perspective complementary to that provided by syndicated loan data.","Borrowing in foreign currency is a prevalent phenomenon, especially in emerging market economies, and has increased (CGFS, 2020). While foreign currency loans can be cheaper than local currency loans, they can expose firms to exchange rate risk by creating a currency mismatch on their balance sheets. Financial markets offer instruments to hedge against this risk, but hedging is costly and firms often remain unhedged.==== As a result, firms may be negatively affected when the local currency depreciates.====The literature has emphasized the potential for this so-called balance sheet channel to counter or even overturn the classic expenditure-switching effect through which devaluations positively affect the performance of domestic firms (Mundell, 1968).==== As policy makers set policies that often directly or indirectly move the exchange rate, it is crucial to better understand the effect of exchange rate changes on firm performance and, in particular, the strength of the balance sheet channel. Exploiting unique loan-level data from U.S. regulatory filings covering a large set of firms in 79 countries, this paper provides new evidence on the effect of exchange rate movements in the presence of foreign currency debt. Specifically, it analyzes how exchange rate changes affect firms’ ability to service their debt depending on the currency in which they borrow.====We start by presenting a parsimonious model of currency choice and default with four testable predictions: (i) A local currency depreciation raises the default probability of a firm borrowing in foreign currency relative to a firm borrowing in local currency. (ii) This effect is smaller if the firm borrowing in foreign currency has a natural hedge. Also, firms are more likely to borrow in foreign currency (iii) if a larger share of their sales is in foreign currency and (iv) if there is a UIP deviation that reduces borrowing costs in foreign currency.====To test these predictions, we employ regulatory filings of large U.S. banks that participate in the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The so-called Y-14 reports contain detailed quarterly information on banks’ corporate loans and leases to non-U.S. borrowers with a loan amount of at least $1 million originated by domestic and foreign offices.==== We observe the location and the rating of the borrower, the currency in which the loan is denominated, and whether and for how long a loan has been past due. In contrast to other cross-country studies that rely on syndicated loan data, 82 percent of the loans in the dataset in this paper are not syndicated, implying that our dataset captures loans that are substantially smaller.==== The sample includes around 26,000 borrowers around the world and runs from 2014q4 to 2018q4, a period that covers both a substantial USD appreciation and a notable period of USD depreciation.====We start by testing the effect of exchange rate changes on the past due status of firms (testable prediction (i)). To isolate the balance sheet channel from the classic expenditure switching channel, we employ a difference-in-difference type approach, comparing outcomes for firms in the same country, industry, quarter, and with the same bank-internal risk rating that borrow in different currencies. The strategy therefore controls for exchange rate effects through other channels (for example, through changes in demand) that are common across firms within these narrowly defined buckets. In addition, we control for the size of loans and their maturities.====In line with the theory, a 10 percent depreciation of the local currency quarter-to-quarter increases the probability that a firm that borrowed in foreign currency becomes past due on its loans by 42 basis points relative to a firm that borrowed in local currency. This effect mainly stems from local currency depreciations and is stronger for firms in industries with a smaller share of foreign sales, in line with testable prediction (ii). Since the baseline probability that a loan becomes past due is around 0.2 percent, the effect is economically meaningful.====It is also considerable given that our estimate should constitute a lower bound for the average treatment effect of borrowing in foreign currency under random assignment. As the theoretical model highlights, a firm's currency choice is not random but depends on the currency composition of its income. And while we compare firms in the same industry, country, and quarter and with the same bank-internal rating, loan size and maturity structure, these firms could still differ in their foreign income. We cannot control for this selection because of a lack of data, but selection implies that the estimated effects are biased towards zero because firms tend to borrow in the currency that offers a natural hedge: A firm with a revealed preference for local currency debt would be more exposed to exchange rate risk if it borrowed in foreign currency than a firm that actually decides to borrow in foreign currency.====While the previously stated results are based on quarterly changes in the exchange rate, we also investigate whether exchange rate changes since loan origination matter for the past due status of firms’ loans. Indeed, a 10-percent depreciation of the local currency from the date of origination until quarter ==== − 1 increases the probability that a firm becomes past due on its loans in quarter ==== by 10 basis points for a firm that borrows in foreign currency relative to a firm that borrows in local currency.====Some firms that become past due on their loans will repay the loan the next period. For these firms, an exchange rate movement may merely create a liquidity problem, but we estimate that around 16 percent of the loans that become past due end up in default. We conclude that firms that borrow in foreign currency remain notably exposed to exchange rate risk, and, that as a result, the effects of exchange rate movements on firm default through the balance sheet channel are economically significant.====We also study how exchange rate changes affect the probability that a firm is downgraded or assigned a higher probability of default by its lender. In line with the results on the past due status of borrowers, firms that borrow in foreign currency are more likely to be downgraded or to be assigned a higher probability of default by the banks when the local currency depreciates than firms that borrow in local currency. Changes in banks’ risk ratings/probabilities of default are much more frequent than the event that a firm becomes past due on its loans (3 and 7 percent of the sample versus 0.2 percent). This additional evidence can therefore address concerns associated with the low incidence of past-due borrowers in the sample.====The unique regulatory data also allow us to shed light on the factors that determine firms’ currency choices. Foreign currency loans are larger and have shorter maturities than local currency loans. In line with the notion that firms choose their loan currency to match the currency composition of their income stream, firms in industries with a higher share of exports in total sales are more likely to borrow in foreign currency. Similarly, firms are more likely to borrow in foreign currency the cheaper the foreign currency loan is relative to the local currency loan in line with testable prediction (iv).==== On average, foreign currency loans have a 100 to 140 basis point lower interest rate. If we adjust interest rates for expected future changes in the exchange rate to obtain the UIP deviations, the difference shrinks to 47–60 basis points.====This paper adds to a rich literature evolving around foreign currency debt and its macroeconomic effects.==== The most closely related papers use micro-level data to study the effects on firm-level outcome variables. A number of papers consider effects on firm investment and employment, often focussing on crisis episodes. Aguiar (2005) shows that firms in Mexico with more short-term foreign debt exposure had substantially lower investments after a large devaluation.==== Along these lines, Kim et al. (2015) report that firms’ economic performance declined and default rates increased more for firms with foreign currency debt during the 1997-1998 Korean crisis. In contrast, Bleakley and Cowan (2008) do not find such differential effects, using accounting data for five Latin American countries.==== Analyzing Mexican firms’ responses to a large devaluation, Hardy (2018) finds that small firms invest less while large firms invest more. Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2016) document adverse effects of devaluations on firm investment in the presence of foreign-denominated debt but only if there is a contemporaneous banking crisis.==== Similar to this paper, Bruno and Shin (2020) and Alfaro et al. (2019) study the role of exchange rate fluctuations for corporate distress outside of crises, focussing on emerging markets. Bruno and Shin (2020) unveil that the stock prices of emerging market firms fall when the firms have outstanding dollar bonds and cash balances in local currency. Alfaro et al. (2019) discover that local currency depreciation increases the effect of leverage on emerging market firm fragility, in particular for firms in non-tradeable sectors. In contrast to previous work that uses firm balance sheet information, this paper employs loan-level information and focuses on new outcome variables: firms’ past due status and the internal risk rating and probabilities of default they are assigned by their lenders. Besides highlighting that firms around the world remain exposed to material exchange rate risk, the paper documents how indirect exchange rate exposure of firms can translate into credit risk for banks.====The link between exchange rate changes and credit risk has been emphasized by macroeconomic papers studying the causes of financial crises. For example, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) find that the collapse of the domestic currency exacerbates banking crises.==== But there is relatively little work on the topic in the micro-banking literature. Kim et al. (2016) study whether banks charge higher interest rates when the borrower is exposed to exchange rate risk. Božović et al. (2009) provide a model where exchange rate risk spills over into default risk, resulting in reduced credit supply and growth. Bruno and Shin (2015a) focus on the implications of local currency depreciation for the credit risk of global banks, showing empirically that banks reduce their cross-border lending when the U.S. dollar appreciates.====The paper also contributes to the work that investigates the determinants of firms’ currency choices (Brown et al., 2011, Bleakley and Cowan, 2008, Kedia and Mozumdar, 2003, and Keloharju and Niskanen, 2001).==== Galindo et al. (2003) provides a survey on the determinants of debt currency denomination. In comprehensive work that is both theoretical and empirical, Varela and Salomao (2016) build a dynamic model of currency choice where heterogeneous firms face a tradeoff between exchange rate exposure and growth since cheaper foreign currency lending allows firms to grow faster.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 proposes a theoretical model of currency choice and default. Section 3 introduces the data sources and presents key facts about foreign currency loans in comparison to local currency loans. Section 4 presents the regression results.

The approach allows us to differentiate between the impact on the median versus the tails of the future predicted density of flows, and between short- and medium-term effects. We find that FX- and macroprudential interventions are effective in mitigating downside risks to portfolio flows stemming from adverse global shocks, while tightening of ==== in response appears to be counterproductive. Good institutional frameworks are not able to shield countries from the increased volatility of portfolio flows in the immediate aftermath of global shocks, but can contribute to a more rapid bounce-back of foreign flows over the medium term. Our results highlight the limitations of the standard approach, which focuses only on the short-term behavior of average flows.","Capital flows to emerging markets (EMs) remain highly volatile. Since the global financial crisis, unprecedented and prolonged monetary easing in advanced economies (AEs) has been associated with strong capital inflows to emerging markets. During the same period, these flows were sometimes disrupted by reversals in the face of unanticipated shocks, such as the “taper tantrum” in 2013, and most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.====Both capital flow surges and “sudden stops” entail risks. Large exchange rate appreciations and accelerated domestic credit growth during periods of inflows create concerns about loss of competitiveness, asset price bubbles, and the build-up of financial sector vulnerabilities (e.g., Bianchi et al., 2016; Cecchetti et al., 2019). On the other hand, large exchange rate depreciations and the sharp tightening of financial conditions that often occur during episodes of capital outflows can threaten borrowers' access to finance and lead to a decline in asset prices, undermining financial stability and GDP growth (Calvo and Reinhart, 2000, Guidotti et al., 2004, Mendoza, 2010, and Bussière et al., 2012, among many others).====However, while the volume of literature on capital flows is considerable, empirical research on the role of policy frameworks and policy actions in addressing volatile flows is scant. Based on the early work by Calvo et al. (1993) and Fernandez-Arias (1996), research has typically focused on “push” factors (such as financial conditions in the U.S.) and “pull” factors (such as domestic growth). Findings generally point to an important role of global “push” factors in explaining portfolio and banking flows (see Koepke, 2019, for a review of the literature). Part of the literature has gone further, trying to understand large in- and outflow episodes – “surges” and “sudden stops” (Calvo et al., 2004; Cardarelli et al., 2010; Forbes and Warnock, 2012; Sahay et al., 2014; Ghosh et al., 2014; Calderón and Kubota, 2019, among others). Other studies have analyzed the role of institutional quality in driving capital flows (for example, Gelos and Wei, 2005, and Alfaro et al., 2008). However, with the exception of some studies on examining the role of capital controls (see, e.g. Montiel and Reinhart, 1999, and the summary in Binici et al., 2010), little attention has been paid to the role of policies. In addition, the standard approach in the analysis of the role of policies has been to focus only on the ==== behavior of ==== flows. Such limited focus misses potentially important intertemporal tradeoffs associated with some policies, and the impact of policies on mitigating ==== to future capital flows.====This dearth of studies on capital flows and policies is surprising given that there has been a considerable growth in the theoretical literature on optimal policies to manage boom-bust-cycle risks associated with changing external financial conditions (see, e.g., Jeanne and Korinek, 2010, Benigno et al., 2013, Unsal, 2013, Liu and Spiegel, 2015, Bianchi et al., 2016, Ghilardi and Peiris, 2016, Cavallino, 2019, Bianchi and Mendoza, 2020, among others).====In this paper, we propose a new method to help fill some of these gaps. We use a quantile regression approach to estimate the entire probability distribution of ==== portfolio flows over different time horizons as a function of current global financial conditions, domestic structural characteristics, policy frameworks, and current policy responses. In this framework, estimated probability densities of future capital flows enable a quantitative evaluation and forecasting of risks to portfolio flows. To address endogeneity concerns, our analysis of policies is based on well-identified policy shocks—namely residuals from estimated policy rules.====Our results show that different country characteristics matter for risks to capital flows in the short- and medium term. We find that more flexible exchange rate regimes are linked to higher risks of both large in- and outflows in the immediate aftermath of an adverse global shock. In the medium term (i.e. over a period of two years), however, more flexible exchange rate regimes seem to support a larger rebound of flows. Countries with better institutions, more transparent central banks, and deeper financial sector development face fewer large in- and outflows in response to global shocks in the medium term (although this is not the case in the short term).====Consistent with the recent theoretical models with financial frictions in FX markets, foreign exchange interventions seem to help mitigate downside risks to portfolio inflows caused by worsening global conditions, but this effect is limited to the short term. A tightening of capital flow measures in response to an adverse global shock is found to be counterproductive (i.e., it exacerbates the risk of large outflows of capital) in the short term. This could be because capital flow measures were not sufficiently comprehensive, leading to leakages, or due to negative signaling effects of such measures. We find little evidence for the effectiveness of monetary policy in shielding countries from risks caused by global shocks, while macroprudential policies appear to have sizeable beneficial effects both in the short- and medium term.====Overall, our findings highlight the usefulness of applying quantile regressions and the “at-Risk” approach to study policies and capital flows: we find that several of the policy actions or policy frameworks may have a considerable impact on the upper or lower tails of the predicted distributions, thus mitigating risks to future flows in the presence of adverse global shocks. Moreover, there are important intertemporal patterns in the effects. These aspects would have been missed by using a standard approach which focuses only on the short-term behavior of average flows.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

Tariff rates are determined endogenously in a sustainable equilibrium of a two country ,"A large literature in economics suggests that trade protectionism varies over the business cycle.==== The most common view is that protectionism is counter-cyclical - a period of low growth and high unemployment will lead to greater calls for trade restrictions to protect domestic jobs. Empirically however, the evidence on the cyclicality of trade policy is mixed.==== From a theoretical viewpoint, it is not clear why trade restrictions should be increased during an economic downturn. If trade policy is aimed at domestic employment, an increase in tariffs during a recession would help domestic import competitors, but hurt exporters. It is not obvious that the balance of influence between import competition and exporters would shift in a clear pattern over the cycle. On the other hand, if trade restrictions are designed to improve the terms of trade, it is unclear why the pressure to exploit market power would be greater in periods of low economic activity.====Bagwell and Staiger (2003) construct a model in which protectionism is counter-cyclical in some circumstances. In their model, trade protection is determined in a repeated game between two countries, and equilibrium sustainable protection satisfies an incentive constraint which balances the benefits of predatory tariffs against the future costs of a trade war. They show that a persistent fall in trade volume during a recession reduces the benefits of cooperation, and leads to an increase in equilibrium tariffs. In a related paper, Bagwell and Staiger (1999) show that tariffs will increase during periods of high import growth, but tariffs will be lower, the greater is the volatility of imports.====The Bagwell and Staiger papers provide key insights into the forces determining trade protectionism. However their theoretical framework is not directly built along the lines of standard open economy macro models, which may include the presence of nominal price rigidities, business cycles driven by monetary or technology shocks, and different degrees of exchange rate flexibility. The last point is particularly important, since a substantial empirical literature suggests that movements in exchange rates, and uncompetitive real exchange rates may lead to increasing forces for protectionism.====This paper revisits the question of the cyclicality of trade protection within a standard New Keynesian open economy macro model which exhibits sticky prices and exchange rate fluctuations in response to monetary and productivity shocks. We show how the basic architecture of open macro models leads naturally to cyclical responses of protectionism when trade policy is determined along the lines of Bagwell and Staiger (2003). Moreover, the endogenous response of the exchange rate is an important channel for the effects of protectionism. We find that trade protection is higher in a regime of flexible exchange rates than when the exchange rate is fixed.====Our results are based on a simple two-country, two good open macro model, in which countries may levy tariffs on imported goods. For a given sequence of tariffs, the model is very simple. Each country specializes in its own category of goods. Prices are set one period in advance and adjust fully after one period. Money and monetary policy are introduced ==== a cash-in-advance constraint, and each country is subject to technology and monetary shocks. We follow Bagwell and Staiger (2003) in the assumption that tariffs are determined by a balance between costs and benefits of deviating in a repeated game between home and foreign tariff setters. The equilibrium tariff sequence can be thought of as an implicit international trade agreement between the countries. On the one hand, there is a gain to any one country on cheating on the agreement and setting a high tariff to improve its terms of trade. On the other hand, the cost of cheating is a reversion to a ‘trade war’ in the future. The sustainable tariffs just balance the benefits and costs for both countries of cheating on the agreement itself.====Despite its relative simplicity, we show that this model can address some of the key issues regarding the cyclicality of protectionism and the relationship between exchange rate flexibility and trade policy, as discussed above. The first question is why should protection be cyclical at all? Why would the temptation to cheat on a trade agreement vary over the business cycle? The New Keynesian model has a natural answer to this. We show that if prices are fully flexible in our model, the equilibrium tariff sequence is basically a-cyclical. While the degree of protection depends on structural features on the economy as well as the policy-maker's discount factor, tariffs do not vary over time.====When prices are sticky however, we show that equilibrium sustainable tariffs are time-varying, and move in response to monetary and productivity shocks. The essential intuition for this is that with pre-set prices, the strategic objective of the tariff setter at any time period is conditioned on given prices, but takes account of endogenous adjustment of prices in the future. This implies that aggregate shocks have different impacts on the benefits and costs of cheating on the trade agreement, and hence the equilibrium sustainable tariff rates themselves must respond to shocks.====Since the incentive to levy tariffs in our model is based on gaining a terms-of-trade advantage, the exchange rate regime becomes an important factor in the determination of equilibrium sustainable tariffs. In our baseline model, we show that if exchange rates are fixed and prices sticky, then neither tariff setter can affect the terms of trade by deviating from a trade agreement. Consequently, equilibrium protection – the average level of tariffs – are higher under flexible than under fixed exchange rates.====Further, as noted above, while the conventional wisdom is that trade protection is counter-cyclical, this is not a consensus view. In our model, we find that protection may or may not be counter-cyclical, depending both on the pattern of shocks and underlying model parameters. In particular, in our baseline model, when the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) is high, we find that sustainable tariffs increase in response to positive monetary policy shocks, while sustainable tariffs fall in response to productivity shocks. Given sticky prices, there is a natural channel through which monetary policy shocks increase the gains from cheating on a trade agreement, while productivity shocks increase the consequences of cheating. As a result, depending on the preponderance of shocks, tariff rates may be pro-cyclical or counter-cyclical. In addition, when the IES is lower, tariffs may become pro-cyclical (counter-cyclical) upon realization of local productivity (money) growth shocks.====Finally, the analysis provides insights into the link between trade protectionism and the volatility of shocks. Indeed, we also find that a rise in the volatility of productivity shocks can have a dramatic effect in reducing the mean level of tariffs over the business cycle. But this arises from a very different mechanism than that of Bagwell and Staiger (1999). In particular, the linkage between the volatility of productivity shocks and equilibrium tariff rates holds only when prices are sticky.====While the above results are derived in closed-form within a simplified model where the trade elasticity is unitary and the consumption bundle a Cobb-Douglas function of imported and local goods, we also show that they hold qualitatively for a more general model where the trade elasticity is non-unitary and the consumption bundles takes a more general CES functional form.====There has been an increasing interest in investigating the effects of trade restrictions in open economy macro models. Barattieri et al (2021) investigate empirically the impact of exogenous changes in tariffs in an SVAR framework, and show that they act as negative supply shocks, depressing GDP and raising inflation with little effects on the trade balance. They propose a small open economy model with firm entry and endogenous tradability that successfully rationalizes the empirical evidence. We adopt a mirror perspective, considering tariffs as endogenous and ask how governments react to economic conditions to determine trade policies over the business cycle. Another recent paper by Erceg et al (2018) studies the effects of trade policies in the form of import tariffs and export subsidies. They show that the macroeconomic effects of these policies critically depend on the response of the real exchange rate, and that in turn depends on the expectations about future policies and potential retaliation from trade partners. Finally, a recent paper by Furceri et al (2018) examines the macroeconomic consequences of tariff shocks, and shows that these shocks are generally contractionary.====Focusing more closely on the endogenous determination of trade policies, we noted above that there is a large empirical literature investigating the link between trade restrictions and the economic cycle, and separately, the effect of real exchange rate undervaluation on trade policy (==== Oatley (2010), Gunnar and Francois (2006), Bown and Crowle (2013b), among others). In a theoretical model Eaton and Grossman (1985) study optimal tariffs when international asset markets are incomplete and show that they can be used to partly compensate the lack of consumption insurance. Bergin and Corsetti (2020) also consider tariffs as policy instruments in addition to monetary policy but their focus is not specifically on tariffs, rather on the implications of monetary policy on the building of comparative advantages. As discussed above Bagwell and Staiger (2003) propose a trade model featuring potential terms-of-trade manipulation by governments, and trade agreements as means to restrict this policy option. Our paper is complementary to theirs. Most importantly, we incorporate endogenous tariff formation within a standard open economy macro model, showing the importance of the types of shocks, price stickiness, and the exchange rate regime for the equilibrium degree of trade protection. Beshkar and Shourideh (2020) offer an analytical determination of unilaterally optimal tariffs in a Ricardian economy that features trade imbalances, and shows that those tariffs are counter-cyclical.==== Finally, while terms-of-trade manipulation is not the sole motive to justify the existence of incentive to apply tariffs and mechanisms to cope with these incentives (such as trade agreements), they are by far the most important and the most relevant from an empirical perspective, as shown by Bagwell and Staiger (2010).====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops a tractable open economy model where tariffs play a role in affecting the exchange rate and the terms of trade. Section 3 looks at the welfare effects of tariffs in this model, shows that the incentive to set tariffs depends on the exchange rate regime and that incentives are lower under fixed exchange rate regimes. Section 4 then extends the analysis to allow for endogenous tariffs, where tariffs are determined as a sustainable equilibrium in a dynamic game between governments. This section shows that tariffs are a-cyclical under flexible prices, but with sticky prices (where prices are preset one period in advance), tariffs vary over the business cycle. In particular, tariffs respond negatively (respectively positively) to expansionary supply (resp. demand) shocks when the IES is high. Section 5 extends the baseline model to allow for a non-unitary trade elasticity and shows that our results continue to hold in this more complex environment.

In an estimated three-region model (US, OPEC, rest of world) incorporating two sectors (manufacturing and services) in the oil-importing economies and featuring cross-border supply chains, such shocks rationalize the observed pattern of a positive comovement between oil prices and the global cyclical gap between manufacturing output and services provision. In the event of manufacturing technology shocks, oil demand, intermediate ","Large upswings and downswings in global oil prices since the mid-2000s have renewed interest in the causes and consequences of such dynamics. In the literature, there is a growing consensus about the need to differentiate between several underlying sources of oil price movements (cf. inter alia Barsky and Kilian, 2002; Kilian, 2009; Bodenstein et al., 2012). The trade channel plays an important role in this context, especially in the case of disturbances to the oil price that stem from shifts in economic activity, as first observed in (Kilian, 2008). In a period in which, for example, Asian (oil demand) growth fuels global oil prices, United States (US) exports are positively affected by increasing foreign demand.====The literature considers models with only one aggregate production sector in oil-importing economies, a practice that has to be called into question when it comes to studying the role of the trade channel in the link between oil prices and the macroeconomy. If it is acknowledged that the oil price moves because of shifts in global oil demand, then this should be attributed mainly to the global production of tradeable manufactured goods. Manufacturing is a sector which, compared with services, is very oil-intensive in production. According to input-output tables from the Bureau of Economic Activity, in 2012, the total requirement for oil use was 6% in manufacturing and 1.4% in services. In the same tables, the share of exports in total production is 21% in manufacturing, compared with 3% in services. Moreover, at a global level, the trade cycle tends to be highly correlated with the industrial cycle, whereas the correlation with GDP is more limited (cf. Kilian and Zhou, 2018; Bobasu et al., 2019). Given business cycle shocks originating in the manufacturing sector, the trade channel therefore plays a role not only in the international transmission of such shocks but also in global oil use, as production and distribution of manufactured goods typically rely on means of transport that make heavy use of oil. Another important dimension that is usually neglected in open economy models but has been stressed more recently is the relevance of global supply chain integration in explaining both trade dynamics and production patterns. As the oil-intensive manufacturing sector typically also uses a large share of domestically sourced and imported manufactured goods as intermediate inputs, there is intuitively a tight link in demand for oil inputs and demand for intermediate manufactured goods. Finally, because oil-producing countries may shift their non-oil imports in response to oil price movements on account of international wealth effects (cf. Bodenstein et al., 2011; Kilian et al., 2009), in times of rising oil prices the global manufacturing sector could additionally benefit from higher demand from oil-exporting countries. From the US perspective, shocks driving the oil price benefit manufacturing if they are related to rising external demand from, for instance, goods exporters (such as in the example of increasing Asian demand growth) or oil exporters (like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC). The large and important US services sector – which does not export much – would, however, not benefit from the external sector in the event of such shocks.====In this paper, I estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model which includes three regions – US, OPEC, and the rest of the world (ROW) – and incorporates two broad production sectors facing nominal rigidity (manufacturing and services). In the model, manufacturing is the more oil-intensive sector and produces tradeable goods, whereas services is the nontradeable sector. The model has an input-output structure and incorporates cross-border supply chain linkages in the manufacturing sector (much like in Georgiadis et al., 2020). Building on Unalmis et al. (2012) and Nakov and Nuño (2013), the model features global oil inventories as well as OPEC as a dominant oil producer with market power over a competitive fringe of non-OPEC suppliers. It incorporates a rich shock structure and is estimated using data on sectoral output and inflation, nominal interest rates and nominal exchange rates for the US, as well as data on the global levels of real oil prices, oil production, oil storage, manufacturing output and services activity (1974Q1 until 2019Q4).====Three channels are especially relevant in the estimated model: (1) In oil-intensive manufacturing production, there is low substitutability of oil and manufactured intermediate inputs. Therefore, in the case of positive manufacturing technology shocks, demand for manufactured goods and oil demand, as well as global oil intensity and non-oil trade decline jointly. (2) Shifts in demand for final manufactured goods result in increased manufacturing output relative to services provision and greater oil demand in the oil-intensive sector, which is amplified by input-output linkages and international trade. (3) When oil prices rise there are wealth shifts from US and ROW towards OPEC that translate into higher OPEC import demand.====The main findings of the analysis can be summarized as follows:====The findings challenge the popular view that the output of oil-intensive manufacturing industries, in particular, is adversely affected when oil prices rise. Also, they are not consistent with the narrative that the 1970s are very different from the 2000s, as the US economy is found to be affected through similar channels in more recent oil-related events compared to earlier episodes. Earlier studies have sometimes suggested that an increase in the oil price driven by global activity is – from the US point of view – always like an exogenous oil supply shock (cf. inter alia Blanchard and Gali, 2010; Blanchard and Riggi, 2013). In this view, the trade channel does not play much of a role and the direct effects of changing oil prices dominate, which is challenged by the results presented here and reaffirms findings in Bodenstein et al. (2012) and Bodenstein and Guerrieri (2018) based on different DSGE models.====My formal analysis corroborates the insights of (Kilian, 2008.) The empirical work complements the evidence provided in Kilian (2009), Kilian and Hicks (2013), and Baumeister and Hamilton (2019) among others, based on different methodologies. Also, the findings of the paper advocate the use of a measure of global manufacturing activity as an indicator of shifts in oil demand related to economic activity, which contributes to the debate on how (structural) oil models should be specified (cf., for instance, Kilian and Zhou, 2018).====The paper adds to many more studies that analyze the relationship between the oil price and the macroeconomy (see, for example, Barsky and Kilian, 2002; Kilian, 2008; Kilian, 2014; Baumeister and Kilian, 2016a). Some papers incorporate exogenous oil price shocks in closed economy DSGE models (inter alia Leduc and Sill, 2004; Carlstrom and Fuerst, 2006; Natal, 2012). The role of openness in the context of macroeconomic effects of oil prices was first addressed theoretically by Backus and Crucini (2000) in a flexible price model and later in models with sticky prices (cf. Balke et al., 2010; Bodenstein and Guerrieri, 2018; Bodenstein et al., 2012). None of these studies includes a nontradeable sector or cross-border manufacturing supply chains in the analysis. One notable exception in earlier literature is Bergholt et al. (2019), who, in a different context, study the business cycle of an oil-exporting economy. Also, contrary to earlier contributions, this paper aims at capturing the most relevant features of the oil market emphasized in recent VAR literature – oil storage, endogenous oil production, as well as the role of the US dollar exchange rate – in a unified DSGE framework.====Most closely related are probably the studies by Bodenstein et al. (2012) and Bodenstein and Guerrieri (2018) who estimate two-country DSGE models (one country being the US). They find oil efficiency shocks to be relevant for the business cycle and as a demand-type source of oil price movements. Contrary to these earlier studies, this paper contributes by highlighting the role of shocks specific to the manufacturing sector that lead to shifts in oil intensity. Distinguishing between manufacturing and services makes it possible to directly identify changes in oil demand in the oil-intensive manufacturing production sector as a key driver of oil prices. Moreover, the sectoral distinction allows the identification of a direct link between these economic activity shocks and international trade.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows. The theoretical model is described in Section 2, while the data and structural estimation approach are presented in Section 3. Details on the most relevant transmission mechanisms and the identified link between global oil prices and the global wedge between manufacturing output and services activity are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents a shock decomposition for important historical episodes. Finally, Section 6 concludes. The online appendix contains detailed data and model descriptions, as well as further empirical results and robustness exercises.","Oil prices, manufacturing goods, and nontradeable services",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199621001331,8 December 2021,2021,Research Article,117.0

This paper derives the optimal price index by solving the Ramsey problem in a New Keynesian ,"As many small open economies (SOEs) have shifted their monetary policy from exchange rate pegs to inflation targeting policies, there has been growing interest in which price index they should target. The theory of optimal monetary policy with a multi-sector economy can be used to answer this question, as in Aoki (2001) and Woodford (2010), but such analyses so far have been limited to closed economy setups, leaving open economy questions unanswered, such as the effect of international commodity prices and the role of trade patterns. This lack of the optimal price index theory in an open economy underlies the ongoing debate over the choice between, for instance, the headline consumer price index (CPI) versus the core CPI in Japan and the CPI versus the producer price index (PPI) in Latin American countries.====In this paper, I analytically derive the optimal price index for open economies to stabilize by solving the problem of a central bank that attempts to maximize household welfare, i.e., a Ramsey problem. I call the derived index the Ramsey price index (RPI) and present its analytical formula for the first time in an open economy setup. Due to the openness of my model, the index depends on the relative volume and the pricing regime of the export in each sector in addition to the parameters studied in closed economy models such as the consumption share, price stickiness and the elasticity of substitution. By calibrating the model to 40 countries with 35 sectors, I find that RPI stabilization performs better for all countries in terms of welfare than the headline CPI, core CPI, or PPI stabilization.====To derive the optimal price index, I begin with the multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with output price stickiness analyzed in Woodford (2010). The use of a multi-sector model is necessary to answer my research question since different price indices arise due to the difference in the weights applied to the prices in different sectors. Output price stickiness is the key monetary friction in my model and in the workhorse model in the literature, in keeping with extensive empirical evidence (see Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), for example). Under output price stickiness, volatile inflation causes mispricing by firms, which leads to welfare-damaging inefficient production activities.====As the key departure from Woodford (2010), I allow each sector in the economy to export a part of its output. This openness allows for a difference between the CPI and PPI because when the economy can trade, what is produced is not necessarily consumed. The choice between the two indices is often the focus of monetary policy discussions especially for commodity exporters and developing countries. For instance, Frankel (2010) numerically analyzes Latin American commodity exporters and concludes that producer price based indices perform better than consumer price based indices in terms of price stability. India changed its target index from PPI to CPI in 2016; see Rajan (2016). The existing theoretical framework is not suitable to answer this type of question since the consumption based weight coincides with the production based weight.====Another key feature of my model is the use of an SOE setup rather than a two-country setup. This approach captures the notion of the international price movement that is exogenous to the economy. The Bank of Japan, for example, argued that the movement of the international oil price was the most important reason that it failed to achieve its inflation target; see Kawamoto and Nakahama (2017). The SOE framework allows me to answer the question of whether the economy should bear the volatility in inflation that is caused by international price changes. For the SOE analysis, this paper also develops the proper treatments of terms of trade externality and the timing of the international asset market, which are generally applicable to SOE setups.====In this multi-sector New Keynesian (NK) SOE DSGE environment, I solve the Ramsey problem and obtain the optimal price index, which remains constant in the long-run expectation. This means that my proposed optimal price index is based on welfare maximization rather than an arbitrary objective. The welfare maximization problem is subject to the optimal behaviors of the representative household and firms under monetary frictions. The use of the Ramsey framework also means that the monetary policy considered in this paper is not limited to a particular class of monetary policy, such as the Taylor rule. Despite the generality of the choice of monetary policy, I show that in the long run, a particular price index remains constant. I explore the property of this RPI qualitatively and quantitatively.====In a similar way to the standard multi-sector closed economy analysis, the essence of the problem of the optimal price index is balancing the trade-off between stabilizing the price of one sector versus the price of another. This trade-off arises because in a multi-sector environment, the inflation rates of all the sectors cannot be stabilized simultaneously following a shock that leads to a relative price change. In such an environment, choosing which price index to stabilize matters for welfare because the welfare cost of volatile inflation differs across sectors. The resulting optimal price index takes the form of a weighted sum of the prices in different sectors, where the weight assigned to each sector reflects the cost of inflation in each sector.====The formula obtained for the RPI gives us three qualitative lessons. First, the RPI takes the form of the PPI adjusted by the price stickiness and the elasticity of substitution under the producer currency pricing (PCP) regime while under the destination currency pricing (DCP) regime, it becomes more similar to the CPI. Second, the desirability of core inflation targeting, or the desirability of placing less weight on prices in the food and energy sectors,==== is an empirical question, whose answers depend on the relative degree of price flexibility and elasticity of substitution. Third, exogenous international prices do not directly appear in the RPI formula. As an implication, a central bank should be concerned about international price movement only to the extent that it affects the RPI.====To supplement the qualitative discussions, the quantitative section of this paper compares the welfare consequences under simple stabilization policies for the RPI and three conventional price indices. Here, a simple stabilization policy means a policy in which the inflation rate in terms of the price index in question is zero in both the short and long run. In reality, implementing these policies via either Taylor rules or exchange rate interventions is simpler than implementing the Ramsey solution itself. However, it is not obvious that the simple stabilization of the RPI yields higher welfare than the stabilization of other price indices since the analytical result only states the optimality of the long-run stabilization of the RPI, whereas the Ramsey solution itself, in general, involves short-run deviations from complete stabilization.====Calibrating to 40 countries with 35 sectors, I show that, for all countries in my sample, RPI stabilization performs the best among the stabilization schemes for the four indices considered. The loss from a simple stabilization of the RPI compared with the Ramsey solution turns out to be negligible and much smaller than the loss from the simple stabilization of the other indices in terms of steady-state consumption. This means that the RPI is suitable not only for long-run stabilization targets but also for short-run targets. This result is robust to different pricing regime assumptions and sensitivity analyses in various parameters.",What price index should central banks target?

Guided by this evidence, we study the welfare effects of the reallocation brought about by stricter standards in a model with monopolistically competitive, heterogeneous firms, and a general demand system. Restrictive standards have an ambiguous effect on welfare. On the one hand, they improve allocative efficiency because low-quality firms over-produce in the market allocation. This market distortion is driven entirely by the presence of variable markups and exists to varying degrees in both homothetic and non-homothetic frameworks. On the other hand, the imposition of stricter standards forces firms to pay a fixed cost that is welfare reducing. We estimate our model for Chile and find significant heterogeneity in the welfare gains from moving to the optimal standards policy across ====.","The design of regulations and product standards crucially depends on the tradeoff between legitimate concerns for public health and safety and the higher costs for firms that have to comply with such regulations. Furthermore, regulators balance preferences of local constituents while minimizing the protectionist aspect on foreign firms. In this paper, we argue that a key aspect of the tradeoff has not been considered: the different effects of regulations on firms that are heterogeneous in their quality and capabilities. Regulations are a bigger burden for small, low-quality firms. Indeed, this is the predominant finding of the empirical literature, which this paper confirms: more restrictive regulations force out small firms and reallocate production towards larger firms (Fontagné et al., 2015; Asprilla et al., 2019). We build a framework to study the welfare implication of such a reallocation of production, and quantify the effects of reallocation by calibrating our model using Chilean firm-level data.====We show that the reallocation induced by regulations can reduce the distortions that arise in allocatively inefficient markets, where large firms under-produce due to market power heterogeneity (Dhingra and Morrow, 2019). Previous studies suggest that such distortions can have a large impact on aggregate productivity (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). In our framework, larger firms produce higher-quality goods; but because the large firms under-produce, the average quality in the market is too low relative to an efficient allocation. By eliminating low-quality firms and increasing the output of larger high-quality firms, regulations can improve welfare through a novel channel.====Optimal standards must also account for negative and unintended effects. Stricter standards can lead to negative welfare effects such as fewer varieties, softer competition, and the use of resources for compliance costs, which can offset the gains in allocative efficiency. Even when a policymakers' objective is to address a positive externality associated with the consumption of high-quality goods, we show that regulations can both reduce misallocation and the externality. Thus, we provide an enhanced framework for policymakers to quantify the optimal level of regulations that are ubiquitous in domestic and trade policy.====Our theoretical framework is motivated by three stylized facts based on panel data on Chilean firms and information from the TRAINS database on sanitary and phythosanitary (SPS) standards. First, we document a positive association between firm size and firm markups. Second, we document that when SPS standards become more pervasive in an industry, small, low-quality firms are forced to exit. Hence, there is a reallocation of production from small, low-quality firms, which have low markups, to large, high-quality firms, which have high markups. This reallocation is driven by changes in the extensive margin, i.e., in the number of surviving firms.====In our third stylized fact, we document that the reallocation towards larger firms is accompanied by a rise in their markups, which suggests possible anti-competitive effects of regulations. However, we find that input measures such as capital intensity, average wages, and material cost per worker, are not affected by regulations. This suggests that changes in SPS standards are not associated with changes in unit costs or quality. These results are in line with the trade literature (references below), which documents that stricter regulations at a destination mainly reduce the number of exporters to said destination, but do not reduce the average export values. The connection to the wider trade literature further motivates our focus on extensive margin channels: regulations from several countries and industries are imposed for a variety of reasons such as addressing externalities and informational frictions, yet allocative implications due to the reallocation they generate have not been acknowledged.====To study the welfare consequences of such a reallocation, we incorporate regulations on product standards into a closed economy model of perfect information, monopolistic competition, and firms that are heterogeneous in quality. We model regulations as a fixed cost that all firms need to pay. Thus, our results can be generalized for all vertical norms and not exclusively product standards.==== To provide a general framework to analyze allocative inefficiency, we choose the “Generalized Translated Power” (GTP) preferences proposed by Bertoletti and Etro (2018), which nest the most common classes of preferences used in the literature.====The sign of the welfare change in response to stricter standards is ambiguous as it depends on the strength of countervailing effects. The positive effect is due to an improvement in the market's allocative efficiency: due to the markup distribution, high-quality firms under-produce and low-quality firms over-produce, relative to an efficient allocation. The reallocation from low- to high-quality firms, which we label the ==== of the standard, moves the allocation closer to the efficient one. The standard has also three negative effects on welfare, which limit the optimal level of restrictiveness. First, there is a reduction in product variety due to firm exit. Second, and connected to the first, the exit of firms can generate ==== effects, whereby surviving high-quality firms increase their markups in response to lower competition. Third, the payment of the fixed cost reallocates workers from output-producing activities to compliance activities, which is welfare reducing. Our general demand system, with a parsimonious parameterization, accommodates different degrees of anti-competitive effects, and the model shows that if these are sufficiently low, then the standard improves welfare. Absent the endogenous distortion that arises due to variable markups, the positive composition effect never dominates.====There are three assumptions to clarify from the outset. First, the closed economy framework allows us to clearly decompose effects on domestic firms, which we believe maintains a manageable scope for this paper.==== Second, motivated by Kugler and Verhoogen (2012), we link the size heterogeneity of firms to exogenous quality draws.==== Finally, the baseline analysis abstracts from consumption externalities that might drive the implementation of regulations we explore in the data. The latter assumption allows us to highlight the novel part of the paper, the allocative efficiency consequences of regulations. However, we verify that our theoretical results hold in an important extension in which we include a positive externality from consuming high-quality goods. We find that the regulation improves allocative efficiency and the externality at the same time under the most plausible scenario.====We leverage our model to estimate the restrictiveness of regulations in the Chilean manufacturing sector, as well as across individual industries. Our goal is to quantify the welfare implications of implementing counterfactual regulatory policies. We note that, although a standard allows for an intuitive theoretical mechanism through which low-quality firms exit, in reality there can be numerous policies that generate the same distributional effect on production. We find a significant presence of such policies across Chilean industries, for example, in 2000, the presence of regulations reduced the survival probability of a firm by 40%.====The estimated regulations are different from the optimal value implied by our model, so we compute the welfare gains associated with setting the standards to their optimal value. As the extent of anti-competitive effects is crucial in determining possible welfare changes, we calibrate the parameter that governs such effects by estimating the elasticity of prices with respect to size and to income with Chilean export transactions. In our baseline specification, welfare gains from moving to the optimal regulations are in the range of 0.1–0.3%. The estimation also highlights the heterogeneity across sectors within manufacturing: metal, furniture, machinery, chemical, apparel, and media sectors have estimated restrictiveness that is about 25% or less of the optimal regulations, while the motor vehicle/transport sector has a restrictiveness significantly larger than optimal. The welfare-improving impacts of regulations are sensitive to anti-competitive effects and are larger when regulations are imposed without requiring wasteful compliance costs. If the regulations also target additional negative externalities, the welfare gains could be larger.==== The trade literature has highlighted that economic integration can reduce the misallocation across firms that are heterogeneous in their productivity. International trade forces the exit of low-productivity firms and, thus, aggregate productivity increases (Melitz, 2003), which can improve allocative efficiency in the presence of variable market power (Edmond et al., 2015; Dhingra and Morrow, 2019).==== This paper shows that a similar reallocation can be achieved with domestic policies that force the exit of low-quality firms.==== Under a plausible set of conditions – governed by the demand faced by firms – regulatory measures can raise welfare through an increase in allocative efficiency. Relative to Dhingra and Morrow (2019) and Bertoletti and Eto (2018), we extend optimality results to a framework with quality differentiation.====In the same vein, our paper relates to the macro and industrial organization studies on the effect of size-dependent policies on welfare. These studies find that government policies that protect small firms and hinder the size of large firms have large distortionary implications (Guner et al., 2008; Garicano et al., 2016). Interestingly, product standards have the opposite effect: by making selection tougher and reallocating production to high-quality firms, distortions are ====.====In a related paper, Edmond et al. (2018) propose a comprehensive analysis of the effects of various policies on misallocation and welfare, in a general dynamic model. Aside from quantifying misallocation within the context of different policies, an important difference with their paper is in the preferences used. While the authors rely on Kimball's preferences, which are homothetic, our model uses a general demand system that nests homothetic preferences as a special case. We show theoretically and quantitatively that, under homothetic preferences, standards generate the smallest welfare gains, because they generate the largest anti-competitive effect. Our quantitative exercise yields a parameter for the anti-competitive effect that is far from that implied by homothetic preferences.====An important contribution of this paper is to provide a rationale for product standards that has not been explored in the previous literature. Quality standards or regulations could be raised to address negative externalities, such as environmental externalities (Parenti and Vannoorengberghe, 2019; Mei, 2020) informational asymmetries (Disdier et al., 2020; Macedoni, 2021), or other market imperfections (Baldwin et al., 2000; Atkeson et al., 2014). Standards could also be used as murky protectionism (Baldwin and Evenett, 2009), as studied by Fischer and Serra (2000) in the context of an international duopoly. This paper is the first to explore the role of inefficient markets due to variable markups, a perspective ignored in the previous literature that mostly relied on perfect competition (Parenti and Vannoorengberghe, 2019) or monopolistic competition with constant markups (Gaigné and Larue, 2016; Mei, 2020; Disdier et al., 2020). Standards can both achieve a reduction of negative externalities associated with low-quality goods and, as a further benefit, reduce misallocation.====Our introduction of a minimum quality standard into the model resembles Gaigné and Larue (2016), who also consider the effects of a minimum quality level allowed in the market. In their model, firms upgrade quality at a cost. Thus, standards force some low-quality firms to upgrade their quality in order to survive in the market. Local welfare improvements of regulations are possible “starting from a low standard”, but since their result relies on CES preferences and constant markups, the market allocation is always efficient. Instead, in our paper, standards are preferred to a laissez-faire allocation.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the stylized facts that motivate our model. Section 3 describes out theoretical framework and discusses the welfare effects of quality standards. Section 4 shows the results from estimating the model.

Since traditional open economy models—which emphasize demand, expenditure switching, and risk-sharing channels—are silent on this fact, Rey (2016) conjectured the existence of an ‘international credit channel’ of monetary policy. This channel rests on the interaction between three main ingredients: a domestic credit channel of monetary policy (Bernanke and Gertler, 1995), high levels of international financial market integration, and the dominance of the US dollar as an international currency. With agency costs between borrowers and lenders and dollar-denominated balance sheets, US monetary policy affects the net worth of economic agents world-wide and, in turn, generates strong co-movement of financial conditions across the globe.====This paper investigates whether US ==== shocks also transmit across borders via an international credit channel and, if so, how they compare to the Fed's actions and words. Recent research has shown that financial shocks—broadly defined as exogenous changes to the net worth of financially-constrained agents or their degree of risk aversion—can play a key role in explaining business cycle fluctuations.==== Financial shocks, however, are hard to identify in the data. Notably, when monetary policy works via an information (or signalling) channel, it can lead to dynamics that are observationally equivalent to those induced by financial shocks. Financial shocks can also behave like other aggregate shocks, which complicates any identification attempt where restrictions are imposed on the signs of their effects.====To address these issues, we develop a new econometric approach that allows us to separately identify monetary policy, central bank information, and financial shocks by combining the information from external instruments and sign restrictions in a structural VAR.==== Our approach consists of two steps. First, we jointly identify US monetary policy and central bank information shocks using the external instruments approach. Following Jarocinski and Karadi (2020), we decompose high-frequency interest rate surprises around FOMC announcements into a monetary policy component and an information component, which we then employ as external instruments in a structural VAR. Second, and conditional on the identified monetary policy and information shocks, we derive from economic theory a minimum set of sign restrictions that can be imposed to uniquely identify a broad class of financial shocks.====To investigate the international transmission of these US shocks, we embed our novel identification approach in a 2-country structural VAR for the US and the UK. We focus on the UK as it is a relatively large small open economy with a well-established inflation targeting regime, a freely floating exchange rate, and a well-developed financial sector, which makes it a good laboratory where to explore our main question of interest.====The paper has three main results. First, our empirical evidence provides strong support for the existence of an international credit channel in the transmission of US financial shocks. Adverse financial shocks trigger a contraction in the US economy, and an increase in US credit spreads. Crucially, this tightening in US credit conditions is quickly transmitted internationally, leading to an increase in credit spreads in the UK, as well as a fall in prices and economic activity. The increase in UK spreads happens despite the accommodating response of domestic monetary policy, which acts to reduce credit spreads via a domestic credit channel.====Second, our empirical evidence corroborates previous results on the international credit channel of US monetary policy for the specific case of the UK, and does so using an improved measure of US monetary policy shocks that also controls for central bank information effects (Jarocinski, 2020). Our impulse responses show that a US monetary policy tightening not only reduces demand and increases credit spreads in the US, but also tightens credit conditions internationally (Rey, 2016). Moreover, and in line with the findings in Kalemli-Ozcan (2019) for a group of advanced economies, US monetary policy shocks lead to a significant fall in the UK-US short-term (and also long-term) interest rate differential.====Third, we show that central bank information shocks lead to strong cross-country spillovers which—like monetary policy and financial shocks—are also transmitted via an international credit channel. An increase in interest rates that signals a better-than-expected US outlook leads to a boom in the US economy and a compression in US credit spreads, which quickly spills over to UK credit conditions. Our evidence is complementary to Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2020a), who provide evidence for a strong information component of FOMC announcements in the post–2009 period.====To further corroborate our evidence on the international credit channel, we perform two additional exercises. First, we explore the quantitative role of the international credit channel with a simple counterfactual exercise. Specifically, we re-compute the effects of financial, monetary policy, and information shocks while keeping US and UK credit spreads constant at their long-run values. For all shocks, our results point to a powerful amplification role played by credit spreads. Second, we investigate how credit spreads based on different asset classes (namely mortgages and interbank loans) respond to the identified financial, monetary, and information shocks.

While this fact is well established in the literature (i.e., Fernandez-Villaverde et al., 2011), its root causes remain unclear. This paper shows that endogenous sovereign default risk can explain time-varying volatility in interest rate spreads paid by emerging market economies (EMEs) on their external debt. In particular, we show that sovereign default models à la Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) can endogenize the stochastic volatility of interest rate spreads and its cyclical properties despite featuring exogenous shocks with constant volatility.====In our analysis, we first highlight a key feature that enables sovereign default models to reproduce the observed time-varying volatility: the non-linearity of the equilibrium function for interest rate spreads. Due to the convexity of default incentives, interest rate spreads are non-linearly increasing in the level of debt and non-linearly decreasing in the level of output. Income shocks that occur in times of high output and low debt generate modest fluctuations of interest rate spreads, whereas income shocks that occur in times of low output and high debt generate wide fluctuations. Hence, the volatility of interest rate spreads fluctuates in equilibrium, even though the volatility of the exogenous shocks is constant. This finding implies that exogenous shocks to the second moments are not strictly necessary to generate fluctuations in the volatility of interest rate spreads, a key property of the data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to highlight the implication of this key non-linearity for the volatility of interest rate spreads.====Second, we quantitatively investigate to what extent a state-of-the-art sovereign default model matching simultaneously the average level of the spreads and the debt-to-GDP ratio can replicate the time-varying volatility observed in the data. We estimate the process of the volatility of interest rate spreads using data for Argentina and other emerging market economies, and we compare it with with the volatility process we obtain from the model economy. We find substantial overlap between the two. We also examine whether our model-based estimates are able to replicate other key facts documented in Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2011), such as the positive correlation between the volatility of interest rate spreads and their level, as well as the negative correlation of volatility with output and consumption. We find this to be the case. Our paper, thus, reinforces the conclusions drawn by Arellano (2008), showing that a sovereign default model can account for the dynamic properties of interest rate spreads.====Our paper contributes to two main strands of the literature. First, we add on the literature on time-varying volatility in macroeconomics. In EMEs, Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2011) document the time-varying volatility of interest rate spreads, and show its negative influence on consumption, output, employment, and investment, through the lens of a model. Yet, they do not provide a theory explaining why the volatility of interest rate spreads fluctuates over time. We show that endogenous sovereign risk and the associated non-linearities can explain those fluctuations. In doing so, our paper complements the work of Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2011) by focusing on the impact that endowment shocks have on the volatility of sovereign spreads, while Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2011) focus on the impact that fluctuations in the volatility of interest rates have on other economic variables such as income.====Second, we contribute to the quantitative literature on business cycles in EMEs. Arellano (2008) and subsequent contributions have shown that sovereign default models in the tradition of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) are able to replicate the correlations between interest rate spreads and key economic variables, such as output and the current account, as well as the level of the volatility of the interest rate spreads that we observe in the data.==== Even when output costs of default emerge endogenously as in Mendoza and Yue (2012), sovereign default models can still replicate the negative correlation between spreads and output.==== We contribute to this line of research by showing that these models are also successful in replicating the dynamic properties of the volatility of interest rate spreads: both the intensity of its fluctuations over time and in its comovements with other business-cycle variables. Within this literature, the recent works by Seoane (2019) and Johri et al. (2020) are especially related to ours. Both papers extend the baseline sovereign default model to consider time-varying volatility. Seoane (2019) studies how fluctuations in the volatility of the output process affect sovereign risk, while Johri et al. (2020) focus on the implications for sovereign risk of the fluctuations in the world risk-free rate and in its volatility.==== Our paper also investigates the nexus between volatility and sovereign risk. However, we differ in that we focus on the endogenous volatility of interest rate spreads. We show that a state-of-the-art sovereign default model without exogenous volatility shocks is able to endogenize the stochastic volatility of interest rate spreads, and we identify and characterize the key non-linearity in the model that drives this result. In that respect, our paper also contributes to the debate on whether business cycles in EMEs are mainly driven by domestic or external shocks (see, e.g., Uribe and Yue, 2006, Neumeyer and Perri, 2005), showing that domestic shocks play a prominent role determining the fluctuations in the volatility of the interest rate.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the methodology proposed by Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2011) to estimate the volatility of interest rate spreads and presents key facts about the volatility of interest rate spreads in a large sample of EMEs. Section 3 briefly describes a state-of-the-art sovereign default model with long-term debt and quadratic output costs of default. Section 4 reports the details of the calibration of the model. Section 5 presents quantitative results showing that sovereign default models can replicate the time-varying volatility in interest rate spreads, despite only featuring income shocks with constant volatility. Section 6 concludes the paper.",Sovereign risk matters: Endogenous default risk and the time-varying volatility of interest rate spreads,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199621001227,9 November 2021,2021,Research Article,121.0

Multinational-owned establishments displayed lower employment growth than a narrow control group and accounted for 41% of the aggregate decline. Newly multinational establishments experienced job losses, while their parent firms increased foreign input imports. We develop a model that rationalizes this behavior and bound a key elasticity with our microdata. The estimates imply that multinational offshoring was responsible for a sizable reduction in U.S. manufacturing employment.","One of the most contentious aspects of globalization is its impact on national labor markets. This is particularly true for advanced economies facing the emergence and integration of large, low-wage, and export-driven countries into the global trading system. Contributing to this controversy, the United States has experienced steep declines in manufacturing employment in the last few decades, paired with extraordinary expansions of multinational activity by U.S. firms. These job losses in the manufacturing sector have received disproportionate attention in the public debate, in part due to the perception that manufacturing jobs offer relatively high skill-adjusted wages.====While a large body of research has studied the connection between international integration and employment, particularly in developed countries, the results have been mixed and the policy prescriptions controversial. There are several factors underlying the conflicting results of this research, including gaps in the coverage and detail of the requisite firm-level data. Data constraints pertaining to multinational firms in the U.S. have been particularly severe, limiting research on their role in the manufacturing employment decline.====In this paper, we ask whether understanding the behavior of multinational enterprises is important for understanding the U.S. manufacturing employment decline. Since multinationals may affect U.S. employment for a number of reasons, we narrow our focus to one salient mechanism: the foreign sourcing of intermediate inputs. That is, we ask whether multinationals accounted for a substantial portion of the manufacturing employment decline, and if so, whether foreign sourcing of intermediates was important for explaining this decline.====To answer this question, this paper uses a novel dataset together with a structural model to show that U.S. multinationals contributed to the the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. Our data from the U.S. Census Bureau cover the universe of manufacturing establishments linked to transaction-level trade data for the period 1993–2011. Using two directories of international corporate structure, we augment the Census data to include, for the first time, longitudinal information on the direction and extent of firms' multinational operations. This data also allows for the distinction between U.S. multinationals and other, foreign, multinationals with headquarters abroad. The expansion of these foreign multinational firms in the U.S. offers one example of how multinational activity can also serve to increase U.S. employment. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first to permit a comprehensive analysis of the role of U.S. multinationals in the aggregate manufacturing decline in the United States.====We begin by establishing four new stylized facts. First, U.S. multinationals represented 33% of 1993 aggregate manufacturing employment but accounted for 41% of the subsequent decline. Second, given their size, U.S. multinationals had surprisingly high job destruction rates and low job creation rates relative to non-multinationals throughout this period. Third, U.S. multinationals had a 3 percentage point per annum lower employment growth rate relative to a narrowly-defined control group sharing similar industry, size, and age characteristics. Finally, we use an event-study framework to compare the employment dynamics in plants which become part of a firm with multinational operations to a control group of non-transitioning plants. These transitioning plants experienced substantial job losses relative to the control group. Together, these four exercises suggest that U.S. multinationals contributed disproportionately to the manufacturing employment decline.====We next examine the trading patterns of multinational and other manufacturing firms in our data. We find that foreign sourcing of intermediate inputs is a striking characteristic of multinationals. Over 90% of overall U.S. intermediate imports in our sample are imported by multinationals. Moreover, the fraction of U.S. multinationals sourcing inputs from developing countries nearly doubled from 1993 to 2011. To illustrate the link between these high and increasing intermediate imports by multinationals and the observed employment declines, we return to the event study. We show that the relative employment declines in transitioning plants are accompanied by large increases in imports of intermediates by the parent firm. The increase in imports is largest when the plant is shut down.====While suggestive, these stylized facts are not sufficient to establish whether a reduction in the costs of foreign sourcing leads firms to increase or decrease U.S. labor demand. To understand the causal mechanism and to quantify the aggregate impact, we present a model of importing. In the model, firms import intermediate inputs from abroad either at arms-length or from foreign affiliates. The firm's optimal sourcing decision balances the gains from access to cheaper intermediate inputs against higher fixed costs.====The impact of foreign sourcing on U.S. employment is determined by two opposing forces. First, a reduction in the costs of foreign sourcing leads firms to have access to cheaper intermediates. As a result, their unit costs fall and their optimal scale increases. This “scale effect” raises their U.S. employment. On the other hand, firms respond by optimally reallocating intermediate production towards the location with lower costs. This “reallocation effect” reduces U.S. employment. We will refer to a positive ==== effect as the complements case, as lower costs of foreign sourcing raise domestic employment. If the net effect is negative, we refer to foreign sourcing and domestic employment as substitutes, as a convenient shorthand.====We show that in partial equilibrium, the value of a single structural constant—the elasticity of firm size with respect to its sourcing capability—completely determines which of the two forces dominates. The range of previous estimates of this constant in the literature is large enough that foreign sourcing could be either complementary or substitutable with domestic employment. We therefore develop a method to structurally estimate an upper bound on this constant using our data on the universe of U.S. manufacturing firms. While a high value of the upper bound leaves open the possibility that foreign sourcing and domestic employment are complements, a low value of the bound unambiguously implies that the two are substitutes. Our method builds on the insight of Blaum et al. (2018) that changes in cost shares are informative about changes in firm unit costs.====Our estimates of the bound are small. This suggests that increases in intermediate purchases from abroad reduce U.S. employment at the firm-level when triggered by a reduction in the costs of foreign sourcing. Our estimates of the upper bound are robust to a number of alternative specifications and across subsamples.====As a final step, we conduct two exercises to evaluate what our estimates imply for aggregate manufacturing employment. In the first exercise, we use the observed changes in firm cost shares together with our parameter bounds to obtain model-implied predictions of the employment loss due to foreign sourcing. This approach captures both the direct impact of foreign sourcing by existing firms as well as the first-order impact on domestic suppliers, holding all else equal. It suggests that about one fifth of the aggregate manufacturing employment decline can be attributed to offshoring by multinationals.====Second, we use a general equilibrium extension of the model which captures additional features such as firm entry and exit. We calibrate it using parameters consistent with our estimated bounds and aggregate import data. Again, the model implies a quantitatively significant employment decline in response to foreign sourcing. The magnitude is similar to the earlier approach as general equilibrium effects broadly offset one another. We note that all attempts to quantify the consequences of foreign sourcing on aggregate employment require strong assumptions and thus must be interpreted with caution.====This paper contributes to a growing literature documenting the impact of international integration on labor markets. Since many commonly used firm-level datasets do not contain ownership information, it is often difficult to identify multinationals and their headquarter location. To overcome this constraint, Harrison and McMillan (2011), Ebenstein et al. (2014), and Kovak et al. (2018) study foreign sourcing by multinationals using Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data. However, as these data only include multinationals, they do not permit analysis of multinationals' behavior relative to a non-multinational control group.====Whether foreign sourcing increases or decreases domestic employment remains an active debate in the literature. A number of papers have found little or no employment reduction in various countries, including Desai et al. (2009), Kovak et al. (2018), Magyari (2017) [U.S.A], Braconier and Ekholm (2000) [Sweden], and Konings and Murphy (2006) [Europe], among others. On the other hand, and consistent with our results, several recent papers with data from other countries have found that firms treat foreign and domestic employment as substitutes.====In contrast to the limited studies on the impact of foreign sourcing by multinationals, a larger literature has examined the impact of international trade on labor markets more generally. In particular, a number of recent papers have studied the impact of import competition from China (Autor et al., 2013; Autor et al., 2014; Acemoglu et al., 2016). Unlike our paper, these studies use regional and industry-level data. In a firm-level study, Pierce and Schott (2016) find lower employment growth in industries that were most affected by the recent reduction in trade-policy uncertainty with China. Several papers have focused on the wage effects of trade, or inequality more generally. For instance, Hummels et al. (2014) find negative wage effects of offshoring for low skilled workers using firm-level data from Denmark.====Finally, the structural model we present draws on a growing literature studying models of firm imports, including Eaton and Kortum (2002), Halpern et al. (2015), Antràs et al. (2017) and Blaum et al. (2018). Relative to these papers, we extend an otherwise standard model of importing to capture key features of our micro data with the objective of increasing its suitability for empirical analysis. For instance, we make minimal assumptions on firms' information sets at the time they choose their sourcing strategy. Further, we explicitly allow firms to source inputs from abroad inter and intra-firm.====Given its prominent role in the public debate, this paper focuses attention on the manufacturing sector. Recent work, such as Fort et al. (2018) and Bloom et al. (2019), finds suggestive evidence that foreign sourcing has offsetting positive effects in non-manufacturing sectors. Our findings do not rule out such positive effects, and in fact we present evidence that multinational-owned non-manufacturing establishments experience higher employment growth during our sample period.==== Since cross-sector transitions of displaced workers are costly (e.g., Ebenstein et al. (2014)) our findings are nonetheless important for understanding the labor market implications of foreign sourcing.====The next section presents empirical evidence establishing the role of multinationals in the U.S. manufacturing employment decline, and links this to their import patterns. Section 3 develops the partial equilibrium model, lays out the structural estimation and discusses the results. Section 4 presents estimates of the aggregate employment decline due to offshoring, including a general equilibrium extension of the model. Section 5 concludes.","Multinationals, Offshoring, and the Decline of U.S. Manufacturing",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620301069,16 October 2020,2020,Research Article,135.0

Fiscal integration between sovereign states is, however, limited by the ability of countries to commit to fiscal transfers. This paper supposes that fiscal transfers between countries must be ==== and asks how this influences the choice between a currency area and a flexible exchange rate regime. The analysis is relevant to the recent controversy over the refinancing of high deficit countries within the Euro-zone area and the reluctance of the core Euro-zone countries to provide fiscal assistance to peripheral countries.====Our analysis starts from two fundamental premises. First, there are welfare gains to risk sharing between countries. There is much evidence to support the position that risk sharing across countries through international capital markets is highly imperfect. For example, Forni and Reichlin (1999) have shown that there exists a large potential insurable income risk in the EU (about 45%), yet risk diversification is highly incomplete.==== In what follows, we assume that intercountry transfers are the only means to share risk. The assumption that transfers are the only means to share risk is a strong one, but it allows us to highlight the role played by intercountry transfers and is a good starting point given the evidence that risk diversification is highly incomplete. Second, the concept of a currency area differs from that of a fiscal union. In a fiscal union, intra-country transfers are implemented by constitution, law or governmental decrees or through the tax system. By contrast, a currency area consists of sovereign and independent nations with no ultimate supra-governmental authority. Therefore, we assume that transfers between countries must be voluntary: a country will make a transfer only if it perceives that the long-term benefit of risk sharing offsets the current cost of making the transfer.====To examine this issue of voluntary intercountry transfers, we consider a standard two-country model with labor productivity shocks. Households supply their labor monopsonistically and consume local and foreign goods and money balances. A wage rigidity is introduced by assuming that wages are set optimally by households, but one period in advance and before the outcome of the productivity shock is known. A rigidity of this type is needed for there to be a difference in equilibrium outcomes under different exchange rate regimes. We consider two regimes: a currency area, in which the exchange rate is fixed, and a flexible exchange rate regime, where the local money supply is fixed. The model is intertemporal and countries are allowed to make voluntary transfers contingent on the productivity shock. Transfers are sustained by the threat of returning to a situation without transfers. To keep the model tractable, we focus on a case with two negatively correlated productivity shocks.====A currency area is costly because it closes down the relative price adjustments that come from exchange rate movements, making output and consumption more sensitive to shocks. This cost may turn out to be a benefit if it helps to sustain better risk sharing arrangements between countries in the currency area. The idea that more risk can paradoxically improve risk sharing, because it worsens outside options, is not new. For example, Thomas and Worrall (2007) show that reducing public insurance (increasing risk) can, with limited commitment, crowd-in private insurance, raising welfare, and similar results can be found in Krueger and Perri (2011) and Park (2014), among others. However, to our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider the issue in the context of endogenous risk sharing transfers between countries and the choice of exchange rate regime in a standard trade model with shocks to productivity.====The purpose of the paper is not to show that a currency area is optimal, rather, to show that risk sharing through voluntary transfers can be an important factor in determining the optimality of a currency area. We believe our results are important because they qualify the standard result of Mundell (1961) on optimal currency areas. The model embeds three features that are usually seen as inimical to an optimal currency area: wage stickiness, asynchronous business cycles and absence of transaction costs.==== Crucially, by allowing for voluntary fiscal transfers, there is an additional and endogenous risk sharing mechanism that can counteract the other factors. As we shall show, asynchronous shocks exacerbate the inefficiency caused by wage rigidity and increase the volatility of consumption in a currency area. However, the combination of asynchronous shocks and wage rigidity imply that there are risk-sharing benefits to be derived from intercountry transfers. If a currency area is associated with more risk sharing through the use of intercountry transfers than the flexible exchange rate regime, then the benefits of a currency area may outweigh its costs, reversing Mundell's result. A contribution of this paper is to provide a model in which these issues can be examined and provide conditions where Mundell's result is reversed.====Section 2 presents the baseline model, the preferences and technology, and the condition for the sustainability of transfers. It describes the economic decisions of firms and households as well as the two exchange rate regimes, the flexible exchange rate regime and the currency area, together with the corresponding money supply rules. Section 3 establishes two important preliminary results. First, Proposition 1 shows that absent any transfer, the flexible exchange rate regime dominates the currency area. If, in both regimes, transfers are chosen to equalize consumption, then the choice of exchange rate regime is irrelevant: both regimes produce the same outcome. Thus, if the currency area is to be preferred, it is because more risk can be shared in the currency area than the flexible exchange rate regime. The purpose of the paper is to show how this can occur when transfers are voluntary. Secondly, we define a ‘fiscal union’ as a currency area with the first-best risk sharing transfers and compare this to the flexible exchange rate regime without transfers.==== Proposition 2 shows that the fiscal union is preferred for a plausible set of parameters. In particular, for sufficiently large shocks, high risk aversion and an elasticity of product substitution that is greater than one, but not too high. In the fiscal union, consumption is perfectly smoothed, which is most desirable when shocks are large and risk aversion is high. The effect of the elasticity of product substitution is more subtle. If the substitutability between local and imported goods is high, then demand is more responsive to price changes. Absent transfers in the flexible exchange rate regime, this leads to undesirable variability in consumption. In the currency area, a higher elasticity of product substitution means more variability in labor, which is compensated for by a higher wage. Thus, a higher elasticity of product substitution leads to greater distortions in the currency area. The net effect on the desirability of the exchange rate regime is ambiguous. In simulations we find that the currency area dominates for an intermediate range of the elasticity of product substitution (the range depends on other parameter values) but that the flexible exchange rate dominates outside this intermediate range.====Having established that a fiscal union can be preferred, Section 4 analyzes how the voluntary nature of transfers affect risk sharing in each exchange rate regime. As in Trionfetti (2018), transfers between countries have a direct impact on consumption and employment but also general equilibrium effects through prices and wages. It is shown that risk-sharing transfers can be supported for lower discount factors in the currency area than in the flexible exchange rate regime (see Proposition 3). This occurs, both because the benefits of risk sharing are greater in the currency area, and because there is a harder landing in the currency area if transfers are reneged upon. Therefore, the currency area provides a stronger incentive to engage in informal insurance. Put differently, the formation of a currency area can be seen as a commitment device that may allow countries to share more risk. As we show, this effect may be so pronounced that, for certain parameter values, the currency area sustains the first-best risk-sharing transfers whereas the flexible exchange rate regime sustains no voluntary transfers (see the Corollary to Proposition 3).====In less extreme cases, transfers are not set at the first-best level but constrained by the requirement that transfers are voluntary. In these cases, the giving country transfers an amount that makes it indifferent between continuing with, and reneging on, the risk sharing scheme. Our results show that the currency area can be preferred for some plausible parameter values of shocks intensity, risk aversion, elasticity of substitution and discount factors This conclusion should nevertheless be applied with caution. The flexible exchange rate regime is preferred for other parameters that might equally be regarded as plausible. Indeed, a crucial parameter for determining which regime is preferred is the ‘trade elasticity’, i.e., the elasticity of substitution between local and imported goods. Since there is considerable debate about the empirical magnitude of this parameter (see, e.g., Fontagné et al. 2018), the paper does not show that the currency area is optimal, only that the combination of risk sharing and voluntary transfers are important in determining when a currency area is preferred.====The nature of the distortions in the model are discussed in Section 5. There are two types of market distortion in the model. There is an absence of insurance markets to offset the risk caused by the uncertainty in productivity and an imperfection in the labor market. The imperfection in the labor market is two-fold: there is monopsonistic wage setting by labor and there is wage rigidity because the wage is set before the outcome of the productivity shock is known. A fiscal union overcomes the distortion in the insurance market and the flexible exchange rate regime overcomes the wage rigidity in the labor market. Using a simple two state model, it is possible to delineate the circumstances in which risk sharing motives matter. This is important because Cole and Obstfeld (1991) established that trade itself plays an important role in risk sharing: a bad shock in one country is compensated by a depreciation of the currency, effectively ‘importing’ the good shock from elsewhere. We confirm that this automatic risk sharing is perfect when the elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign product is unity (the Cobb-Douglas preference case considered by Cole and Obstfeld). The distortion in the allocation of labor is eliminated in precisely this Cobb-Douglas case. The Cole-Obstfeld model is, therefore, exactly the benchmark in which no transfers are needed and the choice of exchange rate regime is irrelevant (see again, Proposition 1). However, when the elasticity of substitution is strictly larger than one (which we more realistically assume), then trade provides an imperfect risk sharing mechanism and consumption is pro-cyclical, both in a currency area and in the flexible exchange rate regime.====Section 6 considers the robustness of the model to some possible extensions. First, for the sake of analytical tractability, our baseline model assumes money supplies that are fixed and independent of the state of nature. In the context of symmetric countries and shocks, such money supply policies are optimal in the currency area but are not so in the flexible exchange rate regime. Section 6.1 considers a case where in the flexible exchange rate regime and in the absence of transfers, money supply is determined as a Nash equilibrium of competing central banks that maximize domestic household expected utility taking as given the policy of the other central bank and wages in the other country. Second, we discuss the default option in more detail. The baseline model assumes that currency area is maintained following a default. In Section 6.2, we assume, not only that transfers cease following a default, but also that countries adopt a flexible exchange rate system from the period after the default. The differences between the two situations can be thought to be related to whether the fixed exchange rate regime corresponds to a common currency area or to a system of pegged exchange rates. In the former case, there may be very high political and procedural costs of exiting a currency union and our baseline assumption is warranted.==== By contrast, such costs are lower if the countries operated a pegged exchange rate system. In that case, the assumption that there is reversion to a flexible exchange rate system after a default may be more reasonable. We show that, under this new default assumption, results on the preference for exchange rate systems qualitatively hold but are quantitatively different: a higher degree of risk aversion is required for the pegged exchange rate regime to be preferred to a flexible exchange rate regime.==== Third, an important advantage of monetary union lies in the reduction of transaction costs in money conversion (Bayoumi 1994). Section 6.3 considers the presence of transaction costs and show how this favors a currency area. Section 6.4 relaxes the assumption that shocks are perfectly negatively correlated and supposes instead that shocks are independently and identically distributed. It is shown that results are qualitatively unchanged. The intuition for this result is that transfers play a role only when productivity shock realizations are asymmetric across countries. Finally, Section 6.5 considers a case where the flexible exchange regime dominates the currency area with optimal transfers as well as without transfers. Nevertheless, our result that the currency area may preferable when transfers are voluntary still holds.====In summary, our analysis shows that the choice of a currency regime cannot be disentangled from the choice about risk sharing. It suggests that currency areas may, in some circumstances, make redistribution more likely. Empirically, this may be hard to establish. Rose and Engel (2002) find a small but positive relationship between currency areas and risk sharing, but given limited data, the effect is statistically insignificant. Similarly, the examples of long-lived currency areas with a federal structure, like the US, France and Germany, show considerable intra-country risk sharing, which has been implemented after the creation of their national currencies. By contrast, the recent Eurozone experience is a testament to a concerted resistance to centralize the fiscal authority.",Currency areas and voluntary transfers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620301057,29 September 2020,2020,Research Article,137.0

We interpret FT in terms of a hold-up problem. If the US negotiates an agreement with a smaller economy, businesses there may make sunk investments for the US market. At the ratification stage, the partner economy will be locked in to the US in a way it was not previously and Congress can make changes adverse to the partner, so to convince the partner to negotiate, it must first commit not to amend the agreement. FT is then Pareto-improving.","A central institution of US trade policy is the practice by which Congress from time to time commits in advance not to amend a trade agreement that is presented to it for ratification, but to subject the agreement to an up-or-down vote. This institution, which delegates a portion of Congress' authority to the executive branch, has been called ==== (FT) in the past, and is often now referred to as ====.====Almost all major trade agreements into which the US has entered have been negotiated under FT to some degree.==== A natural question is why Congress would ever be interested in delegating any of its authority in this way. We offer a new interpretation of FT based on a hold-up problem. In brief, if the US negotiates a trade agreement with a smaller economy, then as the negotiations proceed, businesses in the partner economy may make investments to prepare to take advantage of the US market – quality upgrades to meet the expectations of the demanding US consumer, changes in packaging and adjustments to US regulations, searching for and negotiating with US partner firms to develop marketing channels, and so on. A portion of these investments are likely to be sunk and specific to the US market.==== When the time comes for ratification of the final agreement, the partner economy will be locked in to the US market in a way it was not previously. If Congress is able to amend the agreement, it can make changes that are adverse to the partner but beneficial to the US. Given the ==== diminution of the partner country's bargaining power due to the sunk investments, it may well acquiesce in these changes, thereby accepting an agreement that makes it worse off than if it had never negotiated with the US at all. As a result, if the US wants to convince such a partner country to negotiate a trade deal, it must commit ==== not to amend the agreement ==== – the purpose of Fast-Track Authority.====This interpretation joins a number of others suggested by other authors. Lohmann and O'Halloran (1994) suggest that FT is used to avoid a ‘log-rolling’ problem, in which Congress would otherwise be stuck in a bad equilibrium whereby each member votes for trade protection for other members' constituent industries in return for protection for its own. Delegation to the President is seen as a way of reaching a Pareto-superior outcome of more open trade. Conconi et al. (2012) suggest that FT can be a way export interests in Congress can pry trade policy influence away from protectionists in Congress and hand it to a less-protectionist executive. Celik et al. (2015) suggest that FT may be a way to get out of an inefficient congressional bargaining equilibrium in which each member tries to secure the maximum possible protection rents for her own constituents and to cobble together a bare protectionist majority coalition to achieve it. Amador and Bagwell (2018) suggest that Congress may delegate trade policy authority if the executive branch has superior information, for example about the foreign partner's ability to commit not to invoke hidden forms of protection.==== Our hold-up interpretation is different than these other interpretations since it explains why the partner country government would need FT for negotiations even to begin with.====This insistence is emphasized by Hermann von Bertrab, the chief negotiator for the Mexican government on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). His interpretation of FT is that it “grew out of a perceived need to negotiate with other countries in good faith,” and that “Foreign countries would otherwise hesitate even to begin the process of negotiations.” (von Bertrab, 1997, p. 1) More broadly, the view that partner countries need FT in order to have the ‘confidence’ required to negotiate a trade agreement with the US is expressed frequently by observers of the history and politics of FT.==== As one pundit put it, “Many in Congress view Fast Track as a hammer to drive reluctant nations to the negotiating table because what's agreed to between the dealmakers cannot be changed by those picky partisans in Congress (Guebert, 2014).”====One major innovation of the current paper is to introduce such strategic considerations into a model in which the policy variables are not tariffs but rather rules of origin (ROO). This is realistic in the context of free trade agreements, since WTO rules require internal tariffs in a free-trade agreement to be set equal to zero, but ROO's can be set as part of the agreement in a restrictive manner that reduces or eliminates the benefits of tariff reductions.==== In general, an ROO is an agreed-upon rule for which products can be considered to have originated in the countries that are parties to a free-trade agreement, and therefore are eligible to be shipped from one member country to another tariff-free.====The analysis of optimal (and equilibrium) ROO's is qualitatively quite different from the corresponding analysis of tariffs. It turns out that optimal ROO's quite often take the form of a corner solution, and when ROO's serve a protectionist function there are cases in which an increase in protectionism can worsen rather than improve the terms of trade of the country using it. These are starkly different from results obtained with tariffs (for a survey on tariffs, see McLaren, 2016). We allow for ROO's to be set differently for different industries, so both the level and the inter-industry pattern of ROO's are endogenous. We show conditions such that in equilibrium the ==== optimal level of ROO's from the US point of view are not optimal ====, after the partner country's firms have sunk their investments. ====, Congress would want to tighten those ROO's, extracting more rents from the partner country. This is the source of the hold-up problem that emerges, and is a major departure from the earlier FT papers, all of which focus on tariffs. In addition, we show how the hold-up problem can be qualitatively changed by strong backward and forward linkages, which is a new element to the literature.==== In formalizing our interpretation of Fast-Track Authority, we draw on a wide range of prior work. The idea that firms wishing to export to a given destination must make sunk investments to do so has been explored in many ways. Verhoogen (2008) shows that Mexican firms that begin to export to the US typically upgrade their quality of goods intended for the US market. Hallak and Sivadasan (2013) show how the need to upgrade quality for a high-income export market helps fit firm-level data on trade flows. Handley (2012) and Handley and Limão (2015) show that sunk costs to export to a specific destination can help explain the response of trade flows to uncertainty about trade policy. For example, they show that a significant portion of the trade response observed when Portugal joined the European Economic Community (EEC) can be explained by the elimination of uncertainty about EEC tariffs against Portugal.====The effects of sunk costs or anticipatory investment on equilibrium policy have been studied from a number of angles. Staiger and Tabellini (1989) study time consistency of optimal policy when private resource allocation decisions are made in anticipation of policy. McLaren (1997) shows how anticipatory investment can cause a small country to suffer from a hold-up problem in liberalizing trade with a larger one, and McLaren (2002) shows how similar considerations can lead to the world dividing up into inefficient, exclusionary trade blocks rather than multilateral free trade. Maggi and Rodríguez-Clare (2007) show how similar considerations can motivate a trade agreement as a commitment device to hedge against the influence of domestic political interest groups. Chisik (2003) shows how sunk investments in an export sector can result in gradualism in bilateral trade liberalization as a way of softening incentive-compatibility constraints worsened by the hold-up problem. Chisik (2012) shows that in the presence of periodic trade wars or disputes between trade partners export-sector firms can be deterred from making sunk investments in product quality.====We also make use of tools from the literature on the effects of ROO's. Grossman (1981) studies domestic content rules, whose properties are almost identical to ROO's, while Krishna and Krueger (1995) study a simple model of ROO's, showing how equilibrium is changed qualitatively when the ROO is strict enough that firms have no incentive to comply with it. Falvey and Reed (2002) study a model of optimal tariff preferences and ROO's for a country that imports a final good and does not produce the input required for it. Ju and Krishna (2005) show that the comparative statics of equilibrium with respect to ROO's in a free-trade agreement have important non-monotonicities when the compliance constraint becomes binding. Duttagupta and Panagariya (2007) show how ROO's can make a free-trade agreement politically feasible (possibly at the same time making it inefficient). Overviews are provided by Falvey and Reed (1998) and Krishna (2006). Empirically, Anson et al. (2005) use a qualitative measure of restrictiveness of ROO's to show that more restrictive ROO's in NAFTA tend to reduce Mexican exports to the US, ====. Conconi et al. (2018), also focussing on NAFTA, show that inputs with more ROO's attached to them tend to have lower imports into Mexico from the rest of the world, ====.====We contribute to the theoretical literature on ROO's through an analysis of the ==== in a model with many industries, each of which draws inputs from many industries, which is quite different from what emerges in a model with one final good and one tradeable input.==== One highlight is the finding that equilibrium ROO policy treats different industries very differently even if the industries are symmetric. Another is to show that the effect of ROO's can be qualitatively different in the presence of strong backward and forward linkages compared to weak ones.====In the following section we lay out the model, including consumption, production, bargaining, and how ROO's work. The following three sections show how the model works under FT: Section 3 derives equilibrium conditions under FT including the form of optimal ROO policy; Section 4 shows how to calculate welfare; and Section 5 derives the full equilibrium under FT. Section 6 analyzes the equilibrium without FT. Section 7 then analyzes the choice of whether or not to use FT in the case of weak backward and forward linkages, while Section 8 discusses the case with strong linkages. The last section summarizes our results and concludes.",Fast-track authority: A hold-up interpretation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620301070,28 September 2020,2020,Research Article,138.0

This paper incorporates such a mixed debt structure into a theory of sovereign debt, default and ====. The government optimally uses both default and inflation to balance its budget. The portfolio structure affects the relative benefits of inflation, default and incentives to accumulate debt. A calibrated version of the model can account for key features of the Mexican economy. We use the model to study if portfolio shifts away from purely real and external debt contributed to emerging market disinflation in the mid 1990s. We find that the answer depends on the distinction between ownership and denomination: Increasingly nominal debt is inflationary if held abroad, but lowers inflation if held at home.","Emerging market governments do not borrow exclusively from foreign investors in foreign currencies, instead their debt portfolios are mixed both in terms of denomination and ownership: They borrow partially from domestic investors, partially from abroad; some bonds are denominated in nominal terms, others are inflation-indexed or foreign-currency denominated. At the same time, these countries frequently default on their debt and experience episodes of high inflation or poor macroeconomic performance.====Who holds government debt and whether its value can be inflated away are potentially important factors driving this crisis risk. Predominantly nominal debt might encourage a sovereign to inflate as opposed to default outright, for example, whereas he might default more readily when debt is held abroad rather than by his own residents. Appropriate management of the debt portfolio composition along the ownership and denomination dimensions could thus have beneficial effects. Despite this, theoretical work on sovereign risk and crises has mainly focused on purely foreign held, foreign currency debt. In this paper we generalize this debt structure to include domestic and nominal debt, and study the effects of the debt portfolio composition on macroeconomic outcomes, including debt, default and inflation.====We propose a simple model of sovereign borrowing that incorporates mixed government debt portfolios in terms of ownership and denomination. In the model, a benevolent government issues bonds, prints money, and raises taxes in order to smooth consumption of its residents. It cannot commit to its borrowing policy. This lack of commitment generates positive inflation and occasional default in equilibrium. When issuing bonds and money the government internalizes how demand for them depends on the level of issuances: High future levels of debt or money drive up current default and inflation risk and hence reduce demand.====The bonds that the government has access to are non-contingent and replicate the empirically observed mix of denomination and ownership. They are partially-indexed instruments, a fraction of which is held and priced abroad, while the remainder is held and priced at home. The government can default on them outright at any time, and inflation erodes the non-indexed part of their value. We treat this debt structure as fixed and exogenous and focus on studying the implications of the portfolio structure on the optimal policy of the government.====Both inflation and outright default enable the government to relax its budget constraint: Inflation generates seigniorage revenue and - to the extent that it is unexpected and bonds are nominal - reduces the real debt burden, while outright default directly reduces the outstanding debt. But both are costly, which limits the extent to which the government optimally uses them: Domestic residents hold money because of a cash-in-advance constraint on consumption, so inflation lowers their purchasing power and distorts their consumption decision. Outright default results in temporary productivity drops and bond market exclusion. The government chooses between outright default and inflation by weighing the relative costs and benefits.====The ownership and denomination structure of the debt affects the trade-offs that the government faces when making these decisions. A high share of nominal relative to real debt tilts incentives towards inflation and away from outright default. Predominantly foreign-held debt makes default more attractive because a default increases the total amount of goods available for consumption, whereas a default on domestically-held debt does not affect the aggregate resource constraint.====Strong incentives to inflate do not necessarily lead to high equilibrium inflation rates since they interact with optimal borrowing. On the one hand, strong inflation incentives tend to increase optimal inflation. A high share of nominal debt, for example, implies strong inflation incentives and thus, all else equal, high inflation. On the other hand, strong inflation incentives tend to reduce optimal borrowing by making it more expensive, and thus tend to reduce equilibrium inflation. The same logic applies to equilibrium default rates. Whether a predominantly nominal bond portfolio leads to high inflation or default is therefore in general ambiguous and a quantitative question. Analogously, real debt portfolios may or may not be associated with low equilibrium inflation or default rates.====We calibrate the model to Mexico and match the observed average debt portfolio composition as well as several other key empirical moments such as the inflation rate and debt service. The model fits the data well and preserves many of the desirable features of existing sovereign default models that feature exclusively real, foreign-held debt, while also including new predictions regarding the role of the portfolio structure and inflation: Simulated data from the numerical solution of the model broadly match the empirical public finance split between tax, bond and seigniorage revenue, and predict countercyclical inflation, interest rates and net exports, as well as volatile consumption relative to GDP.====We use the calibrated model to study how the debt portfolio composition affects macroeconomic outcomes, specifically inflation. Since the mid 1990s, emerging markets have experienced pronounced disinflation. Over the same time period, they have moved away from predominantly external and real debt portfolios. We ask whether lower inflation can be accounted for as a result of shifts in the portfolio structure according to the model. We find that the distinction between denomination and ownership is important when answering this question. Specifically, increasingly nominal debt if it is held domestically is consistent with lower inflation. Increasingly nominal debt held abroad on the other hand is not. The main reason for the difference is that any denomination change does not just affect the relative attractiveness of inflation versus default, but also debt accumulation - and the extent to which it does so depends on ownership: More nominal debt shifts incentives away from default and towards inflation as the more effective policy tool. But in the case of external debt, these reduced default incentives also boost borrowing, and thus equilibrium debt and inflation. In the case of domestic debt, on the other hand, bond prices are not very sensitive to changes in default risk, and so increasingly nominal debt does not reduce default incentives sufficiently for borrowing to increase; in equilibrium, debt and thus inflation fall.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After a discussion of the literature, Section 2 presents data on the portfolio structure of sovereign debt for a cross section of countries, Section 3 develops the model, Section 5 discusses the calibration and main results, in Section 6 we discuss the key assumptions of the model and present sensitivity analysis, Section 7 concludes.","Inflation, default and sovereign debt: The role of denomination and ownership",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620301082,28 September 2020,2020,Research Article,139.0

Second, these crucially depend on ","The exchange-rate pass-through (ERPT) measures the evolution of a price after a change in the nominal exchange rate (NER). Estimates from reduced-form empirical approaches, such as vector auto-regressions (VAR) or single-equation models, are a relevant input for monetary policymakers.==== In this paper, we highlight two shortcomings with these empirical estimates that may lead to incomplete and biased inflation forecasts and show how a structural approach can help to prevent them.====The first shortcoming is based on the observation that different shocks affect the NER and prices differently. Empirical estimates are based on isolating “exogenous” or “unforecastable” movements in the NER, producing a single ERPT for different horizons (which we call ==== or ====, UERPT for short). In contrast, in general equilibrium models it is natural to differentiate among alternative shocks, allowing to compute a ==== ERPT for each shock (labeled CERPT). While some studies have documented that the ERPT might differ depending on the shock (as discussed below) we provide a novel analytical characterization of the relationship between CERPT and UERPT; allowing for a clear assessment of the biases emerging from reduced-form estimates. Indeed, we show that the differences can be large.====The second shortcoming is that all ERPTs depend on how monetary policy reacts and, crucially, is expected to behave. This generates a second source of bias for empirical approaches, which can be quantitatively important as well. ERPT estimates from reduced-form approaches are generally taken as a given input for policymakers. However, the realized ERPT will in part be an outcome of both current and expected policy. Reduced-form methodologies are ill-suited to deal with this distinction. In contrast, a general-equilibrium analysis can produce a different ERPT for each alternative policy path under consideration; greatly improving the analysis presented to decision-makers.====We begin by analyzing the information lost in using UERPT measures relative to CERPT. We show analytically that, under certain assumptions –in the context of linear, dynamic and stochastic models– the UERPT obtained using a VAR is a weighted average of the CERPTs. We then propose UERPT measures that are comparable to the empirical ones, useful to quantitatively evaluate possible biases.====We show that CERPTs and UERPTs are indeed very different using a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small and open economy with nominal rigidities. For instance, the one-year ahead inflation forecast can be less than half or more than double when using CERPTs as compared to the forecasts when using UERPTs. These distinctions arise because each shock propagates through different channels.====We then highlight the role of monetary policy in shaping both CERPTs and UERPTs by running several experiments. One of them contrasts the baseline setup –in which policy follows Taylor rule– with an alternative that maintains the rate at its pre-shock level for a given number of periods, returning to the Taylor rule afterward. This attempts to mimic what would happen if a policymaker, guided by an estimated ERPT that is relatively low, convinces herself that the likely effect on inflation will be small; deciding not to change the policy stance. We show that important differences may arise, depending also on the shock hitting the economy.====We finally check that our main results remain robust to different specifications and are overall quantitatively relevant. To that end, we first explore alternative specifications of the baseline model such as indexation, differences in the pricing and invoicing-currency for tradables, financial frictions, and variations in parameter values. We then check the quantitative relevance by running the same exercises using a large-scale DSGE model, estimated with Chilean data, to see a practical application. In all these cases the differences between CERPTs and UERPTs, as well as their dependence on expected monetary policy, remain relevant.====In terms of the related literature, three previous papers using VAR models, Shambaugh (2008) and Forbes et al., 2017, Forbes et al., 2018, recognize the existence of different ERPTs depending on shocks. They use alternative identification assumptions to estimate how several sources of fluctuations might generate different ERPTs; in the same spirit as our definition of CERPTs. Our work deepens their analysis in two ways. First, these studies do not show how these CERPTs compare with unconditional measures; a comparison that we explicitly perform to understand the bias implicit in UERPTs. Second, the identified shocks in these structural VARs might still be too general compared to those in a DSGE model, allowing us to provide a relatively more precise description of the relevant CERPTs.==== Importantly, our analysis does not hinge on DSGE models providing a better fit to the data than VARs; nor do we claim this is the case. We just stress that DSGE models allow to calculate ERPTs conditional on well-specified structural shocks and to control for alternative policies, which cannot be done with empirical models, including VARs.====Two related papers using DSGEs are Bouakez and Rebei (2008) and Corsetti et al. (2008). The former is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that uses an estimated DSGE (fitted to Canadian data) to compute CERPTs, providing also a measure that would qualify as UERPT. Our paper differs from theirs since we provide an UERPT measure that is directly comparable to those estimated in the empirical literature, allowing a better understanding of the produced biases. Corsetti et al. (2008) explores the structural determinants of the ERPT to import prices from a DSGE perspective, assessing possible biases in single-equation empirical methodologies. While our paper shares common points with this study, we distinguish between CERPTs and UERPTs, characterize ERPTs for several prices, and provide a quantitative evaluation of the biases. Still, none of these studies explore the second shortcoming we highlight regarding expected monetary policy.====The relationship between monetary policy and the ERPT has been studied in several papers, but none has explored how alternative ==== policy paths affect the ERPT. For instance, Taylor (2000), Gagnon and Ihrig (2004) and Devereux et al. (2004) use DSGE models to see how monetary policy can alter the ERPT, proposing that a greater focus on inflation stabilization can explain why the empirical measures of ERPT seem to have declined over time in many countries. Others have analyzed how monetary policy should differ depending on structural characteristics associated with the ERPT, such as the currency in which international prices are set, the degree of nominal rigidities, among others. Some examples are Devereux et al. (2006), Engel (2009), Devereux and Yetman (2010), and Corsetti et al. (2010). The point we want to stress, although related to these previous papers, is however different: the expected policy path can have an important influence in realized ERPTs. In a way, the ERPT that will materialize after a shock is to a large extent a policy option, not a policy-invariant parameter as it is many times treated both in policy and academic discussions. Moreover, given the increased emphasis on communicating the expected policy path by central banks, our work highlights that ERPT discussions should also be framed in a similar forward-looking manner.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical strategies used in the literature and their relationship with DSGE models. The baseline model is presented in Section 3. Section 4 shows the CERPTs and UERPTs, providing intuition behind the differences after each shock, and their magnitudes. The dependence and relevance on expected monetary policy are studied in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the robustness of the main results to several modifications in the baseline model.

These studies emphasize that international trade can enhance innovation through competition (Bloom et al., 2016), widened access to foreign markets (Bustos, 2011), or the complementarity between imported intermediates and investment in research and development (R&D) (Bøler et al., 2015). In this paper, we propose a novel channel through which trade liberalization encourages innovation activities through the removal of trade policy uncertainties (TPU) in the export destination markets.====Innovation demands enormous and irreversible investments before commercialization and is deterred by uncertainty. Therefore, trade agreements can induce innovation because they reduce TPU and make market conditions more transparent and predictable. To confirm this, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment brought about by China’s accession to the WTO. Specifically, the United States granted China permanent normal trade relationship (PNTR) status on January 1, 2002. Prior to that, Chinese exporters were at risk of being burdened with punitive “non-NTR” tariffs.==== In a testimony to Congress, Robert Lighthizer, the current U.S. trade representative, explained that the threat of high non-NTR tariffs was real. Every year, during the 1990s, the U.S. Congress fiercely debated to overriding the Presidential waiver that renewed China’s temporary NTR status.==== Thus, the conferment of PNTR status to China puts an end to the uncertainty associated with the annual review by Congress and implied higher expected payoffs for the Chinese exporters.====We examine the extent to which the reduction in TPU can explain the recent surge in Chinese firms’ innovation activities. In 2002, China filed around 50,000 applications for invention patents (ranked 7th in the world), while in 2012, the number of applications increased more than tenfold and surpassed that of the United States, the European Union, and Japan, who are recognized as the most innovative nations in the world.==== A few studies have already shown that a reduction in TPU substantially promotes Chinese exports (Pierce and Schott, 2016; Handley and Limão, 2017; Feng et al., 2017). We show that TPU reduction also contributes substantially to patent applications by Chinese firms.====More specifically, we assembled a large and unique panel of Chinese firms with information on their production, trade, and patent applications before and after China’s WTO accession. We focus on invention patents since they are a more reliable measure of innovation quality. We measure TPU for each industry as the pre-WTO gap between the non-NTR tariff and the observed Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff, following Handley and Limão (2017). Given substantial variations in this uncertainty measure across industries, we adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation approach for identification. We compare the patent filing behavior of manufacturers in industries experiencing greater uncertainty reduction (i.e., the treatment group) to that of manufacturers in industries experiencing less uncertainty reduction (i.e., the control group) before and after China’s entry into the WTO in 2001. The results show that uncertainty reduction significantly encourages patent applications: sectors with a larger reduction in uncertainty experienced faster growth in innovation after the WTO accession. Interestingly, reducing uncertainty not only induces innovation through expansion of the export market, but also exerts a direct effect on innovation. The overall effect of reducing market uncertainty is sizeable: a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the benchmark model finds that for a firm in a sector with average level of pre-WTO TPU, removing the associated uncertainty would increase its filings of invention patents by 0.0064, which is about one third of the actual increase in the average patent filings per firm from the pre-WTO to the post-WTO period.====Our work suggests an important channel through which trade liberalization can stimulate innovation, and ultimately promote economic growth. In a departure from existing studies, we directly connect firms’ innovation incentives to their expectations about the market environment. The literature has emphasized that efficiency loss can be caused by market uncertainty. For instance, Bloom et al. (2007) document that stock market volatility leads firms to delay investment. We view TPU as an important source of market uncertainty and provide rigorous empirical evidence to show that the existence of TPU not only hinders export growth (as confirmed by the literature), but also discourages firms’ investment in innovation. Our results are robust when we control for other determinants of innovation, such as domestic and import competition, input trade liberalization, and domestic reforms. Moreover, we find that firms’ response to TPU reduction is heterogeneous, depending on their productivity, ownership, exporting status, and the irreversibility of investment.====We examine possible channels through which TPU reduction affects innovation. First, studies on specific industries suggest a positive effect of expected market size on innovation, such as Dubois et al. (2015) on the pharmaceutical industry. Is the TPU effect completely captured by a market size effect? If so, we would expect the differential impact of TPU reduction on firms with different exposure to disappear once we control for firms’ export volume. The results, however, show that the differential effect of TPU is still present after we have explicitly controlled for market size. Secondly, patenting can be viewed as the outcome variable of innovation, while expenditures on R&D, fixed capital investment on machinery and equipment, and imported inputs are considered the input variables of innovation. How would TPU reduction stimulate inputs in innovation? Our results show that TPU reduction significantly increases the treated firms’ capital investment and imported inputs. We also find stronger effect of TPU reduction in R&D-intensive sectors.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to identify the causal effects of TPU on firms’ innovation activities. Our paper contributes to the broad literature on the effect of uncertainty on investment. In particular, theoretical work such as Dixit and Pindyck (1994) highlights a “wait and see” strategy of firms facing uncertainty when investment is irreversible. Rob and Vettas (2003) illustrate how demand uncertainty induces multinationals to both export and do FDI. A few empirical studies, including Guiso and Parigi (1999) and Bloom et al. (2007), confirm the negative relation between investment and uncertainty. Closely related, Pierce and Schott (2018) examine the effect of TPU reduction on the investment behavior of U.S. industries and plants. They find that industries more exposed to TPU reduction experience declines in investment but the effect is heterogeneous within industries. Our work differs in our focus on the impact of TPU reduction on firm innovation. In this sense, we make a novel contribution to two strands of literature.====First, our study contributes to understanding the impact of trade on firms’ innovation incentives. Drawing on firm level data, recent studies show that international trade can promote innovation by either intensifying competition or enlarging access to foreign markets. Bloom et al. (2016) find that import competition from China induced the technical upgrading of European firms, in terms of patenting, usage of information technology, and productivity. Based on a Melitz-type heterogeneous model with technology choice, Bustos (2011) shows that increasing export sales can induce Argentinean exporters to upgrade technology. Aghion et al. (2019) show that a positive export shock spurs innovation for productive firms, because the positive ==== effect dominates the negative ==== effect. Coelli et al. (2016) exploit ==== variations in firms’ exposure to different markets and provide evidence that trade liberalization encourages firms’ patent filings. Regarding the prevalence of trade in intermediate goods, Bøler et al. (2015) point out that imported intermediates may complement investment in R&D, so improved access to imported inputs promotes innovation and technological change, while Liu and Qiu (2016) find that input tariff reduction may discourage indigenous innovation by Chinese enterprises. The study closest to ours is Coelli (2018), who explores variations in cross-country industry-level patent filings to show that the granting of PNTR by the United States reduced TPU across sectors and encouraged innovation in China. In comparison, our paper employs firm-level data of Chinese manufacturing firms, therefore we are able to examine the heterogeneous response of firms to TPU reduction.====Second, our work contributes to the increased attention on the impact of TPU. Most previous studies, however, focus on the direct impact of TPU on trade. The pioneering work by Baldwin and Krugman (1989) adopts a real options approach to explain the hysteresis of trade during large swings in the exchange rate. In a series of studies, Handley (2014), and Handley and Limão, 2015, Handley and Limão, 2017 emphasize the uncertainty induced by trade policies and examine its impact on trade and welfare. Following their approach, Feng et al. (2017) examine the effect of TPU reduction on the extensive margin (i.e., entry of firms) of Chinese exports to the United States. Taglioni and Zavacka (2013) find that importer uncertainty imposes a strongly negative but nonlinear impact on foreign suppliers. Beestermöller et al. (2018) study the uncertainty due to the possibility of border rejection of Chinese agri-food exports. Besides the trade effect, TPU reduction also has a substantial impact on employment and regional economic development. Pierce and Schott (2016) link the sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing employment to changes in U.S. trade policy that removed the tariff uncertainty on Chinese imports. On the other hand, Cheng and Potlogea (2015) show that Chinese cities experienced a larger increase in their exports to the United States if they were exposed to TPU reduction, resulting in a faster growth in population, output, and employment.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the policy background and data; it also lays out our empirical strategy. Section 3 presents the estimation results. Section 4 discusses extensions and possible mechanism.

The main constituents of country portfolios in the model are general derivatives, which could be interpreted as nominal bond assets and liabilities in particular. Under very weak conditions, the world wealth distribution is stationary. Stationarity is generated by movements in derivative (i.e., bond) risk-premia such that the return on a debtor country's gross liabilities is less than the return on its gross assets. This is well known feature of the US international investment position. We also provide suggestive evidence that a similar property holds more widely for a sample of advanced and emerging market countries.","The last three decades have seen an unprecedented increase in two-way financial flows between countries. Even after the Great Financial Crisis, there has been a continued increase in the size of gross external assets and liabilities, and at the same time a continued presence of large current account imbalances across countries (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007b; Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2018).====In an environment with large holdings of gross assets and liabilities denominated in different currencies, asset classes, or maturity structures, the interpretation of the current account based on a simple measurement of net-foreign assets (NFA, hereafter) may be quite misleading (see Obstfeld (2012)). Borio (2016) argues that from a policy perspective, the central role of the current account in the G20 policy debate is not informative for understanding external imbalances and instead it is more important to focus attention on the structure of external assets and liabilities. In fact, financial globalization may facilitate larger current account positions than would be consistent with capital markets based on one-way capital flows (Obstfeld, 2012).====This paper develops a simple, analytically tractable general equilibrium model of portfolio choice in a two-country one-good world economy with incomplete markets and trade in derivatives, which may also be interpreted as nominal bonds. The model provides insights into the relationship between gross external asset and liability positions and the determination of the current account. The analysis shows that endogenous portfolio composition, involving movements in gross positions, is essential in facilitating international net capital flows between countries. Movements in net foreign assets are generated by gross assets and gross liabilities moving in the same direction, giving rise to time-varying portfolios and asset returns. The dynamics of ==== positions in assets with different risk characteristics are essential ingredients in facilitating ==== capital flows.====An important building block of the paper is that endogenous variation in gross portfolio positions and real returns ensure a stationary world wealth distribution, implying that countries' external imbalances are self-correcting. The key mechanism ensuring stationarity and self-correction is that asset returns move so as to reduce the cost of borrowing for debtor countries. Countries with negative net foreign asset positions tend to have higher excess returns on their assets relative to their liabilities and vice versa.====The key feature of the model is the ability of derivatives to share country-specific risk in an incomplete markets environment. Trade in derivative assets allows for effective portfolio diversification. We start with a stochastic, continuous time framework with country-specific technology shocks. If financial markets consisted only of a real risk-free bond, as in the textbook one-good current account model, because productivity shocks are permanent, then there would be no gains from trade between countries at all. But trade in derivatives allows for countries to share risk by holding a diversified portfolio of domestic and foreign derivatives. Because risk sharing is limited, country specific shocks cause movements in relative national wealth levels across countries. This causes time-variation in derivative returns and portfolio shares. Movements in portfolio holdings, or gross positions, are in turn associated with net capital flows between countries. Thus, current account movements are inherently tied to the adjustment of national portfolios and two-way capital flows. For instance, a country experiencing net capital inflows may be simultaneously issuing home derivatives, but purchasing foreign derivatives.==== In our model, derivatives are represented as zero net-supply assets, and defined simply by the fact that their real return covaries with national technology shocks. So long as shocks are not perfectly correlated across countries, derivatives allow for international risk-sharing.====We derive a novel condition for stationarity in the world distribution of wealth in the presence of derivative trade. So long as derivatives allow some cross country risk-sharing, the world wealth distribution is stationary. Moreover, there is a simple and highly intuitive explanation of the stationarity result: asset returns tend to move to the disadvantage of creditor countries and to the advantage of debtor countries. This ensures that as a country's relative wealth position deteriorates, its cost of borrowing also falls, encouraging it to invest in its domestic technology, and increase its expected growth rate. More specifically, we find that debtor countries face a lower return on their gross liabilities than they receive on their gross assets, while creditor countries face the opposite situation. In this way stationarity in the wealth distribution is tied directly to time-variation in asset returns and portfolio composition.====We show the results first in a baseline version of the model in which there is trade in derivatives and a real risk-free bond. As a special case, we also consider trade in nominal bonds, whose payoffs are denominated in national currency, and are subject to national monetary policy shocks and exchange rate shocks. The nominal bond trading economy provides a laboratory for taking the model to the data. The feature that overall international investment returns are negatively related to net foreign asset positions seems consistent with observations. It is widely acknowledged that the US, as the world's largest debtor, receives a higher return on its gross external assets than it pays on its gross external liabilities (Gourinchas and Rey, 2014). In Section 3.2.2 below we provide illustrative evidence of a similar property for a large sample of countries.====Furthermore, we show that the stationarity results apply in a number of different extensions of the model, restricting trade to nominal bonds only, to trade in just one country's nominal bond, or in environment extended to allow for trade in both nominal bonds and equity. We find that nominal bonds act as a complement to trade in a real risk-free bond. By contrast, nominal bonds represent a substitute for trade in equity. In the baseline model, we assume no direct trade in claims to the economy's production technology (equity). Unrestricted equity trade would imply complete markets. In an extension however, we allow limited equity trade. But even then, agents may hold only a small share of foreign equity. The reason is that the risk-sharing through nominal bonds may remove the need for trade in equity. Thus, the presence of nominal bond trade may imply a home bias in equity holdings.====Our paper is related to a number of strands in the literature on risk-sharing and international financial markets. An important element of our model with nominal bonds is that in an environment of incomplete markets, the return-distribution of nominal assets plays a role in cross country risk-sharing. This insight was noted in early papers by Svensson (1989) and Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2000). A similar mechanism underlies the model of Devereux and Sutherland (2008). At a more general level, other recent papers have noted the risk sharing properties of non-contingent bonds in two-good frameworks, where bond returns in different currencies or goods are affected by endogenous movements in the terms of trade. In particular, this property holds in the models of Engel and Matsumoto (2009), Heathcote and Perri (2013) and Kollmann (2006), who show how endogenous relative prices may support complete markets even with home bias in equities. Also, Coeurdacier et al. (2010) and Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2016) explore the role of bonds in hedging terms of trade and real exchange rate risks. The latter paper provides strong empirical evidence for the role of bond positions in accounting for home bias in G7 countries. Coeurdacier and Rey (2013) survey the recent literature on home bias in equity portfolios.====More generally, Devereux and Sutherland, 2010, Devereux and Sutherland, 2011, Tille and van Wincoop (2010) and Hnatkovska (2010) independently develop alternative local approximation methods to solve country portfolios in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with incomplete markets. But their local approximation does not allow them to explore the issue of stationarity. Several other authors investigate the global dynamics of country portfolios. Pavlova and Rigobon (2008) construct a continuous-time stochastic model of portfolio choices with portfolio constraints, and focus on aspects of asset pricing and the international transmission of stock prices. Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2015) develop a continuous-time stochastic two-country two-good model with incomplete markets à la Cole and Obstfeld (1991), and explore pecuniary externalities due to excessive short-term credit flows. Devereux-Yu-contagion-RES numerically explore country portfolio dynamics and financial contagion in a two-country environment with occasionally binding credit constraints. Our paper is complementary to the studies above by focusing on the stationarity of the country wealth distribution and the stability of external imbalances.====In addition, the source of stationarity in the wealth distribution here differs from that of previous literature. In a version of the neoclassical growth model with idiosyncratic endowment risk, Aiyagari (1994) shows that precautionary savings can support a stationary wealth distribution, as long as agents are not too patient (see also Krusell and Smith, 1998; Carroll, 2011). With precautionary saving, stationarity is ensured by poor agents saving more and wealthy agents saving less, while all saving is done in the form of an aggregate risk-free asset.==== Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003) quantitatively compare a set of alternative mechanisms for ensuring stationarity in locally approximated small open economy models. A model with a debt-elastic interest-rate premium in these models might be most related. Nevertheless, in our model stationarity is associated with aggregate shocks, which change the composition of real returns. But the presence of derivatives (or nominal bonds) is also critical. In order to ensure a stationary wealth distribution, agents must continually adjust not only their aggregate savings, but also the portfolio composition of their savings.====Our paper falls in a second strand of literature on external imbalances and current account adjustment. Financial globalization leads to a wide distribution of current accounts and net external investment positions (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007b; Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2018).==== Net external deficits can be adjusted either through future trade surpluses (trade channel) and/or excess returns of external assets over liabilities (valuation channel). Gourinchas and Rey (2007b) and the follow-up researchers illustrate that the United States earned a higher rate of return on external assets than it paid on liabilities over various data samples as the US net foreign asset position turned negative, and the valuation channel contributed to a large fraction of its cyclical external financial adjustment.==== Our model implicitly includes both the direct returns and the valuation channel, providing a theoretical justification for this characteristic of external financial adjustment. Section 3.2.2 explores this property using data on observed international investment positions for a wide group of countries. Based on a sample of 19 advanced countries and 32 emerging and developing countries during 1980–2016, we find evidence that the ratio of a country's net foreign assets to GDP has a significantly negative effect on the excess return of external assets over liabilities. The empirical evidence is therefore consistent with our model, which predicts a negative relationship between country's net foreign assets and the excess return on domestic investment in the rest of the world. This self-correcting channel acts so as to stabilize the wealth distribution across countries in the long run.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section develops the basic model with general derivative trading and derives the main results, providing a full characterization of international portfolio holdings as well as establishing the stability properties of net foreign assets. Section 3 explores nominal bond trading as a special case of Section 2, but considers national monetary policy shocks and exchange rate shocks. A subsection reports some illustrative empirical evidence for the relationship between net foreign assets and excess returns on the external portfolio. Section 4 extends the model to a number of different environments. Section 5 presents some final remarks.","International capital flows, portfolio composition, and the stability of external imbalances",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219962030101X,9 September 2020,2020,Research Article,142.0

Baier and Bergstrand (2007) suggest two explanations: tariff phase-out and delayed pass-through of tariffs into import prices. We examine these hypotheses using 1989–2016 U.S. import growth and product-level data on the tariff phase-out negotiated under NAFTA and the earlier Canada-U.S. FTA. We do not find evidence supporting either hypothesis. While products receiving tariff cuts do show delayed import growth relative to products with unchanged tariffs, the delay in import growth does not correspond to delays in the timing of tariff cuts. We also show that tariff cuts are fully and immediately passed through to U.S. importers as there are virtually no changes in the prices received by exporters either in the short run or the long run. Rather, we find evidence for an important role played by NAFTA tariff cuts reducing the impact of frictions that, in turn, allow for a spatial expansion of imports across the U.S.","After controversial negotiations, the U.S., Canada, and Mexico recently implemented a revised North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and re-branded it as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Signed in mid 1992, NAFTA came into effect in 1994 and incorporated the earlier U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) implemented in 1989. As one of the world's largest trade agreements, understanding the economic outcomes of NAFTA is important not only in the current political debate, but also for trade policy analysts and economists in general. Indeed, CUSFTA/NAFTA have been extensively studied to determine how Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) affect their members' trade, output, prices, welfare, and more generally the winners and losers of globalization.====An interesting phenomenon in the FTA literature is that FTAs have delayed effects on trade flows. Baier & Bergstrand (2007, p. 7) use lagged FTA dummy variables in a gravity model of international trade and find the classic stylized fact that “... an FTA approximately doubles two members' bilateral trade after 10 years.” Fig. 1 illustrates this stylized fact for CUSFTA/NAFTA by plotting cumulative growth of real U.S. imports from Mexico, Canada, and the Rest of the World (ROW) as of CUSFTA's enforcement in 1989.==== It reveals U.S. imports from Mexico started growing more rapidly, and more rapidly relative to ROW, once NAFTA came into force in 1994 and only leveled off in the early-mid 2000s. Fig. 1 also shows a qualitatively similar story for U.S. imports from Canada.====Baier & Bergstrand (2007, p. 89-90) suggest two hypotheses to explain these prolonged differential growth rates of real trade flows. Their first one is a “tariff phase-out” hypothesis which, citing the original European Economic Community agreement and NAFTA as examples, revolves around the observation that “... virtually every [FTA] is ‘phased-in,’ typically over 10 years.” Thus, one could naturally expect FTA trade flows to increase over time as the FTA gradually phases out bilateral tariffs with longer phase-out periods displaying more gradual increases in trade over a longer period of time. The second one is a “delayed tariff pass-through” hypothesis whereby tariff changes filter through to prices gradually over time. In this case, one could again naturally expect FTA trade flows to increase over time as tariff cuts gradually filter through to import prices.====Inclusion of the Baier and Bergstrand (2007) lagged FTA terms has become standard in applied work and there is consensus that lagged FTA terms yield positive and statistically significant effects on bilateral trade for 5–10 years after the FTA enters into force.==== A striking limitation of these studies is that they do not explicitly demonstrate the causal relationship between product-level tariff phase-out and product-level trade. A key reason for this is that the product-level “staging categories” that define tariff phase-out are embedded in complicated product-level documents running hundreds of pages and cannot readily be incorporated in studies spanning multiple countries and FTAs. At best, the lagged FTA terms in aggregate studies can be assumed to capture the delayed trade growth stemming from tariff phase-out, but cannot be interpreted as evidence of a causal relationship.====Our paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to explore the relevance of either Baier and Bergstrand (2007) hypothesis — “tariff phase-out” or “delayed tariff pass-through” — as an explanation for the delayed impact of FTAs on trade flows. To do so, we examine CUSFTA and NAFTA to determine how tariff phase-out affects trade flows and, as proxied by unit values, import prices. Specifically, we merge U.S. product-level import data and unit values with detailed information on the tariff phase-out staging categories agreed by the U.S. in CUSFTA and NAFTA. We use a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach or, in other words, a triple-difference (DDD) approach from the applied microeconometrics literature dating back to Gruber (1994). While a triple-difference approach has been used in the trade literature, it has not been used in the FTA literature.====The DDD approach applies naturally in our context. Intuitively, our main empirical strategy looks at import growth between the pre- and post-NAFTA period (i.e. the first difference) from NAFTA partners vis-à-vis ROW (i.e. the second difference). But, to control for broader non-tariff related NAFTA effects, the DDD approach looks at this measure of import growth for products where tariffs are phased out ==== to products that were already duty free before, and hence continue duty free after, NAFTA (i.e. the third difference).====In terms of the tariff phase-out hypothesis, we do not find evidence that ==== in import growth correspond to ==== in tariff cuts. Imports of products receiving tariff cuts show delayed import growth and grow more, both in the short and long run, than the continue-duty-free products where tariffs were already zero before NAFTA. And, comfortingly, the magnitude of the effects, both within a country for products of different phase-out duration as well as across countries for products with the same phase-out duration, are broadly consistent with differences in the actual country-product specific tariff cuts embodied in NAFTA. However, crucially for the tariff phase-out hypothesis, we find that the bulk of this delayed impact comes from products that ==== had their tariff cut to zero and, in the case of Mexico, had their tariff-free access via the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program converted into ==== tariff-free access. In other words, products where the tariff was phased out over 5–10 years do ==== show a more pronounced pattern of delayed import growth relative to products where tariff-free access was granted immediately upon implementation of NAFTA. This is inconsistent with the tariff phase-out hypothesis.====For the delayed tariff pass-through hypothesis, we do not find any evidence that tariff cuts gradually filter through to import prices over time and, in turn, lead to gradual import growth. Specifically, we look at tariff-exclusive prices paid to foreign exporters, as proxied by unit values, and find that the dynamic path of prices does not differ between products receiving NAFTA tariff cuts and products that were duty free before, and continue duty free after, NAFTA. This suggests the tariff cut is fully and immediately passed through to U.S. importers. Thus, for the delayed tariff pass-through hypothesis to be working in practice it would have to be that importers are only passing through the tariff cut to U.S. consumers gradually over time which, in turn, gradually increases imports over time. Of course, further exploration of this idea would require transaction-level U.S. sales data.====Our findings on import prices relate to recent empirical evidence on tariff pass-through during the recent wave of U.S. protection under the Trump administration. Using quite different methodologies, Amiti et al. (2019), Fajgelbaum et al. (2019), and Cavallo et al. (2019) find almost complete pass-through of these new U.S. tariffs to prices, proxied by unit values, paid by U.S. importers. This contrasts with standard terms-of-trade theory whereby prices paid by U.S. importers should fall for goods where the U.S. has market power. A possible explanation for this puzzle is that import prices will eventually adjust in the long-run. However, Amiti et al. (2020) find their earlier results in Amiti et al. (2019) hold with an extra year of data. Our results also push back against resorting to the long run to reconcile this puzzle by suggesting that import prices do not respond to tariffs even in the long run.====As an alternative explanation of the delayed post-NAFTA import growth, we present indirect evidence that NAFTA tariff cuts reduce the impact of frictions related to ==== in the U.S. that exporters enter. Our conclusion on this “spatial margin” relies on U.S. import data that report the customs district where a product enters consumption channels. Regardless of the specific phase-out category, we see products imported from Mexico gradually spread out geographically across the U.S. over time after NAFTA cuts their tariffs. Moreover, these spatial margin results are especially pronounced for homogeneous goods and final goods. Thus, a product's spatial margin appears crucial for understanding post-NAFTA delayed import growth driven by NAFTA tariff cuts.====Although detailed exploration of the mechanism behind our spatial margin results is beyond the scope of this paper, we have in mind a framework with two broad modeling features. First, heterogeneous foreign firms face a fixed cost for entering each geographic market in the U.S. As such, only a subset of potential exporting firms actually export to each geographic market. But, lower U.S. tariffs increase the profitability of entering these markets and thereby increase the set of firms that can cover the fixed entry cost and actually export to a given U.S. geographic market. Second, successful entry into a new geographic market makes it more attractive to enter other ones. Albornoz et al. (2012) find empirical evidence for a model of “sequential exporting” whereby firms sequentially expand into destination markets due to a learning process where profitability in export markets is positively correlated over time and across destination markets.==== Together, these two broad modeling features would generate spatial expansion after tariff cuts.","Phase out tariffs, phase in trade?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620301008,8 September 2020,2020,Research Article,143.0

Recent literature estimates the effect of robots on local employment by regressing the change in employment on exposure to ==== robots in local labor markets. I construct a similar measure of exposure to ","The debate about the impact of robots on employment focuses almost entirely on developed countries. One reason for this may be that robots are adopted mainly in advanced economies. Yet even though most robots are installed within the borders of the developed world, they may threaten workers outside of these borders. In response to increased offshoring, many cheap labor locations such as China, Mexico, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam have become more specialized in low-skill, manual tasks in the past few decades. In the meantime, the invention of robots has created a cheap alternative enabling the performance of precisely these tasks at home. Despite the lack of scientific evidence for this mechanism, there is growing anecdotal evidence that advances in robot capabilities can fuel so-called ‘reshoring’, heralding the potential reversal of offshoring.==== Via this mechanism, increased use of robots in the developed world may pose a particular threat to workers in offshoring countries.====Economists have recently started to examine the impact of ==== on employment, but with a focus on ==== countries. Graetz and Michaels (2018) were the first to examine the effect of industrial robots across 17 highly developed countries and industries.==== They find that robots increase labor productivity, and some evidence that they reduce the hours worked by low-skilled workers. More recently, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) have added to this discussion by examining, both theoretically and empirically, the effect of robots on employment and wages in the United States. First, they develop a theoretical model in which robots compete against human labor in specific tasks. They show that in this class of models, the general equilibrium effect of robots can be estimated by a relatively simple regression (see Section 2). Second, exploiting variation in exposure to robots across US local labor markets, they find that one new robot reduces employment by six workers in the United States.====In spite of these findings, it remains unclear how robots affect employment in offshoring countries. This is despite the fact that robots may foster a recent phenomenon called ====.==== Reshoring describes the reverse process of offshoring, namely that previously offshored tasks are moved back into the home country. One of the reasons why companies may decide to not offshore or even to reshore production is that advances in robotic automation technologies reduce their costs of production, no matter where they produce. This, in turn, increases the attractiveness of domestic production as compared to offshoring. Robots thus have the potential to fuel reshoring.====Recent examples of this reshoring process are the new proto-type “Speedfactories” of the German sportswear company Adidas. Traditionally, companies in this industry had offshored production to cheap labor locations like China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. In contrast, the new factories are located in Ansbach, Germany and Atlanta, US, and produce 500,000 pairs of shoes per year using mainly industrial robots. Since robots cannot perform all tasks, the Speedfactories employ about 160 people locally in Ansbach and Atlanta, compared with more than 1000 in a typical factory in an offshoring location (The Economist, 2017).====Mexico is one example of such a location, as it has relied heavily on offshoring – for the most part from the US – in recent decades. Historically, offshoring by US firms has taken the form of shipping parts and components to Mexico for assembly into final goods, which are then shipped back to the US. This division of tasks has been supported by the introduction of the so-called ==== system in 1965, which exempts dedicated export-producing firms from tariffs on imported inputs. As a result, Maquiladoras have become an essential part of the Mexican economy, with an increase in their share of manufacturing employment from 4% in 1980 to 28% in 2002 (Hanson, 2007).====However, in recent years, the number of Maquiladoras and other export-producing factories in Mexico has been falling. Fig. 1 depicts the development in the number of such factories from 1990 to 2015. Following a growth spurt after the introduction of NAFTA in 1994 and a sharp drop after the US recession of 2001, the number of factories per million people has been steadily declining since the early 2000s. One potential explanation for this is the invention of industrial robots that are also capable of assembling intermediate inputs into final goods.====In this paper, I estimate the effect of ==== and ==== robots on employment in Mexico. I use 1990–2015 data from Mexican local labor markets (i.e., commuting zones, CZs) as well as robot shipment data for Mexico, the US and nine other countries.==== Similarly to Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020), I estimate the effect of Mexican robots on local employment, using a local labor market's exposure to ==== robots. In addition, I consider an export-producing sector, which may be affected by US robots. I estimate the effect of US robots on local employment via a similar measure, namely, the exposure to ==== robots. This measure uses the US national adoption of robots in each industry, the local distribution of export-producing employment across industries, and the initial reliance of the US on imports from Mexico. These variables may suffer from endogeneity resulting from an industry's or a specialized local labor market's decision to adopt robots. I construct two instruments, one for each exposure to robots variable, to purge the results of such endogeneity concerns. In particular, I instrument robot stocks in Mexico and the US with robot stocks in the rest of the world (i.e., neither US nor Mexico), and the share of Mexican imports of US output with a more general measure of offshoring as developed by Feenstra and Hanson (1999).====The IV results show that US robots reduce employment in Mexico by reducing exports to the US. I also explicitly explore alternative explanations such as preexisting trends, contemporaneous changes to single industries (e.g., the automotive industry), or migration patterns across local labor markets driving the results and find no support for these. Notably, the negative effect of foreign robots on employment is evident and quantitatively similar in ==== long difference specifications exploiting only differences in exposure to foreign robots across CZs within the same time period, ==== stacked difference specifications exploiting both the geographic and the temporal variation in CZs' exposure to foreign robots, as well as ==== stacked difference specifications exploiting only differences in exposure to foreign robots within the same CZ across time periods.====The estimates imply that a local labor market with an average exposure to US robots experienced a 0.43 percentage point lower growth in the employment-to-population ratio between 1990 and 2015, compared with no such exposure. At the national level, this amounts to about 270,000 fewer jobs in Mexico. This suggests that roughly 5% of all US robots compete with workers in Mexico. The negative effect of US robots on Mexican employment is stronger for men than for women, and strongest for low-educated machine operators in the manufacturing industry. To shed light on the mechanism behind this employment effect, I show that it is mirrored in similarly sized reductions in exports from Mexico and also reductions in export-producing plants, corroborating the view that robots foster reshoring.====A number of recent studies empirically investigate the impact of robots on middle- and low-income countries. Studies drawing on variation across countries and industries find somewhat mixed results. On the one hand, Artuc et al., 2020 find that greater robot adoption in the developed world leads, on average, to a rise in imports from developing countries and an even greater increase in exports from developed ones.==== On the other hand, Krenz et al. (2018) document a positive association between increased robot density and reshoring. Similarly, De Backer et al. (2018) find evidence for robots in developed countries reducing the rate of offshoring in recent years. Carbonero et al. (2018) also find that robots in developed countries reduce offshoring to emerging countries, and, moreover, find strong negative effects on employment in these countries.====Only recently, two studies have emerged that also exploit plausibly exogenous geographical variation in robot exposure within countries. Artuc et al. (2019) also examine the impact of US robots on Mexican local labor markets. They find that US robots reduce exports from Mexico to the US as well as manufacturing employment in areas specialized in tasks susceptible to being replaced by robots, but do not find a negative effect on overall employment. The identification strategy in this paper differs from theirs, as it relies solely on revealed comparative advantages of local labor markets prior to the advent of robots (i.e., before 1990), makes no assumption that robots differ systematically in their capabilities across industries between developed and developing countries, and exploits variation in robot exposure not only across local labor markets but also across time periods.==== More recently, Stemmler (2019) has adopted a similar strategy for Brazil, and finds that foreign robots decrease manufacturing employment through reduced exports of final goods.====The remainder of this paper is stuctured as follows: Section 2 presents the basic model that serves as a basis for the empirical strategy, and describes how I complement this basic model with an export-producing sector to identify the effect of foreign robots on employment in Mexico. Section 3 lays out the empirical strategy and describes the instrumental variables. Section 4 reports the data sources and describes the construction of the data set. Section 5 presents the main results.

Yet estimates vary widely. We collect 3524 reported estimates of the elasticity, construct 32 variables that reflect the context in which researchers obtain their estimates, and examine what drives the heterogeneity in the results. To account for model uncertainty, we employ Bayesian and frequentist model averaging. To correct for publication bias, we use newly developed non-linear techniques. Our main results are threefold. First, there is publication bias against small and statistically insignificant elasticities. Second, differences in results are best explained by differences in data: aggregation, frequency, size, and dimension. Third, the elasticity implied by the literature after accounting for both publication bias and study quality lies in the range 2.5–5.1 with a median of 3.8.","How does the demand for domestic versus foreign goods react to a change in relative prices? The answer is central to a host of research and policy problems in international trade and macroeconomics: the welfare effects of globalization (Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare, 2014), trade balance adjustments (Imbs and Mejean, 2015), and the exchange rate pass-through of monetary policy (Auer and Schoenle, 2016), to name but a few. Any attempt to evaluate the effect of tariffs in particular depends crucially on the assumed reaction of relative demand to relative prices. In most models, the reaction is governed by the (constant) elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. The size of the elasticity used for calibration often drives the conclusions of the model, as shown by Schurenberg-Frosch (2015), who recomputes the results of 50 previously published models using different values of the elasticity. She finds that, with plausible changes in the elasticity, the results change qualitatively in more than half of the cases. As Hillberry & Hummels (2013, p. 1217) put it, “it is no exaggeration to say that [====] is the most important parameter in modern trade theory.”====Yet no consensus on the magnitude of the elasticity exists. In different contexts, researchers tend to obtain substantially different estimates, as observed by Feenstra et al. (2018) and many commentators before them. In this paper we assign a pattern to these differences, a pattern that we hope will be useful for calibrating models in international trade and macroeconomics. The elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods is commonly called the Armington elasticity, in honor of Armington (1969), who first formulated a theoretical model featuring goods distinguished solely by the place of origin. The first estimates of the elasticity followed soon afterward, and many thousand have been published since. As the Armington-style literature turns 50, the time is ripe for taking stock. We collect 3524 estimates of the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods and construct 32 variables that reflect the context in which researchers produce their estimates.====A bird's-eye view of the literature (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) shows four stylized facts, three of which corroborate the common knowledge in the field. First, the estimates of the elasticities vary substantially. A researcher wishing to calibrate her policy model has plenty of degrees of freedom; she can easily find empirical evidence for any value of the elasticity between 0 and 8. Such plausible (that is, justifiable by some empirical evidence) changes in the elasticity can have decisive effects on the results of the model. For example, Engler and Tervala (2018) show that changing the elasticity from 3 to 8 more than doubles the estimated welfare gains from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Second, the median estimated elasticity in the literature is 1, and many estimates are close to that value. Third, the reported elasticity seems to be increasing in time, but it is not clear whether the apparent trend reflects fundamental changes in preferences or improved data and techniques used by more recent studies.====Finally, the fourth stylized fact is that newer studies show more disagreement on the value of the elasticity of substitution. That is, instead of converging to a consensus value, the literature diverges. The increased variance in the estimated elasticities provides additional rationale for a systematic evaluation of the published results. For this evaluation we use the methods of meta-analysis, which were originally developed in (or inspired by) medical research. Recent applications of meta-analysis in economics include Imai et al. (2020) on the present bias, Card et al. (2018) on the effectiveness of active labor market programs, and Havranek and Irsova (2017) on the border effect in international trade. An important problem inherent in meta-analysis is model uncertainty because for many control variables capturing study design, little theory exists that can help us determine whether they should be included in the baseline model. To address this issue, we use both Bayesian (Raftery et al., 1997; Eicher et al., 2011) and frequentist (Hansen, 2007; Amini and Parmeter, 2012) methods of model averaging (Steel, 2020, provides an excellent description of these techniques).====Meta-analysis also allows us to correct for potential publication bias in the literature. Publication bias arises when, holding other aspects of study design constant, some results (for example, those that are statistically insignificant at standard levels or have the “wrong” sign) have a lower probability of publication than other results (Stanley, 2001).==== In the context of the elasticity of substitution, it is safe to assume that its sign is positive: a negative value is not compatible with any commonly applied model of preferences. Similarly, it is difficult to interpret a zero elasticity. Thus, from the point of view of an individual study, it makes sense not to report such unintuitive estimates—and instead find a specification where the elasticity is positive—because non-positive elasticity suggests that something is wrong with the data or the model. Nevertheless, non-positive estimates will occur from time to time simply because of sampling error; for the same reason, researchers will sometimes obtain estimates much larger than the true value. If large estimates (which can be intuitive) are kept but non-positive ones are omitted, an upward bias arises. Paradoxically, publication bias can thus improve inferences drawn from some individual studies (since they avoid making central conclusions based on negative or zero elasticities) but inevitably distorts inference drawn from the literature as a whole. Ioannidis et al. (2017) show that, in economics, the effects of publication selection are dramatic and exaggerate the mean reported estimate twofold.====To correct for publication bias, we use meta-regression techniques based on Egger et al. (1997) and their extensions together with three new non-linear techniques developed specifically for meta-analysis in economics. The first one is due to Ioannidis et al. (2017) and relies on estimates that are adequately powered. The second technique was developed by Andrews and Kasy (2019) and employs a selection model that estimates the probability of publication for results with different ====-values. The third non-linear technique is the so-called stem-based method by Furukawa (2019), a non-parametric estimator that exploits the variance-bias trade-off. In all the models we run, linear or non-linear, Bayesian or frequentist, we find evidence of strong publication bias in the estimates of the long-run Armington elasticity. The bias results in an exaggeration of the mean estimate by more than 50%. In contrast, we find no publication bias among the estimates of the short-run elasticity. One explanation consistent with these results is that the short-run elasticity is commonly believed to be small and less important for policy questions, so there are few incentives to discriminate against insignificant (and even potentially negative) estimates of the elasticity. Large estimates of the long-run elasticity, in contrast, appear intuitive and desirable to many researchers (see, for example, the discussion in McDaniel and Balistreri, 2003; Hillberry et al., 2005).====Our findings indicate that study characteristics are systematically associated with reported results. Among the 32 variables we construct, the most important in model averaging are the ones related to the data used in the estimation: data frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual), data dimension (time series, cross section, or panel), and data size. We also find systematic correlation between measures of quality and the magnitude of the reported elasticity. Studies and estimates of higher quality (as measured by the number of citations, publication in a refereed journal, quality of the journal, and preferences of the authors of the primary studies) tend to report larger estimates.====While publication selection creates an upward bias, estimates of lower quality seem to yield a downward bias. We exploit our large dataset and the relationships unearthed by Bayesian model averaging to compute a mean effect corrected for publication bias but conditional on the design of the most reliable studies. In an alternative approach, we divide the estimates into groups based on the quality of the journal and the preferences of the authors themselves, while still controlling for publication bias. The implied Armington elasticity in both approaches lies in the range 2.5–5.1 with a median estimate at 3.8, and we interpret the number and the interval as our best guess (based on the available empirical literature published during the last five decades) on how to calibrate a model that allows for only one parameter to govern the aggregate elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods—for example, an open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the type used in many central banks. We also report implied mean elasticities for individual countries.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes how we collect data from primary studies. Section 3 tests for publication bias in the literature. Section 4 explores heterogeneity and computes the range of elasticities implied by correction for publication bias and quality.

Since the passage of this cabotage law a century ago, a plausibly exogenous rise in foreign competition has contributed to the closure of most American shipyards and to a decline in American-built ships. Thus, the Jones Act requirements have become more onerous over time. The results show that domestic shipments are less likely to be transported via water than imports of the same good into the same state. Exploiting the decline in Jones-Act-eligible vessels over time, additional results show that this cabotage law has disproportionately decreased domestic water trade especially in coastal states. These findings support common, but to date unverified, claims that the Jones Act impedes domestic trade.","Water transportation in the United States is regulated by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as the Jones Act (JA).==== This cabotage law requires that all goods transported via water between two U.S. points be carried on ships that are American built, owned, crewed, and flagged (see Section 2.1 for additional details). As a result, the U.S. is ranked as having the most restrictive maritime transport industry among all OECD countries.==== This paper examines the impact of the Jones Act on the U.S. economy.====The Jones Act was passed in response to World War I, with the goal of ensuring that the United States had a merchant marine fleet that was capable of assisting in times of war or emergency (Frittelli, 2003). Proponents, such as American shipbuilders and seamen, contend that the Jones Act promotes national security, supports domestic employment, and provides safety benefits. However, critics argue that the Jones Act is “one of the most blatant forms of U.S. protectionism” (Rodrik, 2018) which restricts domestic trade and drives up prices.==== Anecdotal stories about the effects of the Jones Act include Hawaiian ranchers sending cows to the mainland on airplanes, New Jersey struggling to obtain much needed road salt from Maine, and East Coast lumber coming from Western Canada rather than from Washington and Oregon.==== While critiques of the Jones Act are common, there is relatively little empirical evidence supporting these claims.====The global maritime industry has evolved enormously since the passage of the Jones Act a century ago. The most striking change has been the dramatic rise of the Asian shipbuilding industry. Due to streamlined production processes, standardized designs, and improved efficiency it is much less expensive to build a large merchant ship in Asia than in the U.S. Specifically, it now costs four to five times more to build these vessels in the United States (OECD, 2019; Frittelli, 2019). This has led to a remarkable reversal of fortune where the number of major U.S. commercial shipyards has plummeted from over sixty post-WWII to now just a few (Colton and Huntzinger, 2002) and 91% of all merchant ships are now built in Japan, Korea, or China (UNCTAD, 2018). As the U.S. shipbuilding industry has become increasingly uncompetitive, the number of American-built ships has declined. The empirical analysis examines whether the lack of Jones-Act-eligible ships has stifled domestic trade.====This paper weaves together a variety of data to provide new insight into how the U.S. maritime industry has evolved over the last century. Complementing this descriptive evidence is an empirical analysis that utilizes comprehensive data on Jones Act ships, domestic trade by commodity and state, and international trade by commodity and state to examine the economic effects of the Jones Act over the past two decades (1997–2016). The detailed trade data is especially appealing for this analysis because it is available by mode of transport, which provides an opportunity to examine how the Jones Act affects domestic waterborne shipments. Of course any analysis of a 1920 policy faces some inherent data constraints and in this case the lack of domestic trade data from a hundred years ago means that it is not possible to compare the pre- and post-JA periods. Instead the goal of this analysis is to creatively use the available data to investigate a question with important policy implications. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first careful empirical assessment of this cabotage law.====The empirical strategy exploits a few appealing historical features. First, the passage of the Jones Act a century ago means that it was not influenced by current economic conditions, which is typically a concern when examining the impact of a policy change. Second, the subsequent decline of the U.S. shipbuilding industry was driven by a factor (i.e. foreign competition) that was unrelated to American economic conditions. Third, the Jones Act only affects domestic water shipments and not imports or domestic trade via other modes of transportation.====A difference-in-difference approach compares domestic water shipments to shipments via other modes and to imports from abroad. Shipments via other modes of transport are not covered by the Jones Act and they do not have American-built restrictions of their own. Imports are also a useful comparison group because the Jones Act only applies to shipments between U.S. points and not to shipments between the U.S. and foreign countries. The cross-sectional results show that domestic inflows are less likely to be transported via water than imports of the same commodity into the same state. These results are consistent with the lack of JA-ships impeding domestic water trade between states. Similar findings are obtained when focusing only on imports from Canada and Mexico and the results are stronger in coastal states which can more easily substitute towards water imports from abroad. These findings confirm an intuitive but important point that as water transportation becomes more onerous, due to the Jones Act, domestic water shipments decrease.====An additional analysis exploits the decline in JA-eligible ships over the sample period. The results show that a 10% decrease in the capacity of Jones Act ships is associated with a 2.7% decrease in domestic water inflows, after accounting for unobserved time-invariant and time-varying factors that could influence trade. As domestic water transportation has become more difficult, states acquire similar goods from abroad or via other modes of transport. The decline in JA-eligible vessels does not significantly affect water shipments into non-coastal states but reduces domestic water shipments into coastal states by 6.8%. Overall, the Jones Act disproportionately affects the expected mode of transportation (water relative to other modes), the anticipated type of trade (domestic versus international), and the expected location (coastal states). This provides compelling evidence that the Jones Act does indeed limit domestic water trade.====Causality is pinned down by instrumenting Jones Act ships with shipbuilding in the U.K.==== This identifies the common response to foreign competition and discards variation that is driven by idiosyncratic conditions in the U.S., such as domestic demand for water transportation.==== The instrumental variable results show that an exogenous 10% decline in Jones Act ships has caused domestic waterborne trade to decrease by 3.4%. This can have important economic implications. For instance, the decline in domestic shipments, due to the Jones Act, causes consumer prices to rise (see appendix Table A7). Overall, the findings of the paper provide the first empirical evidence that the Jones Act restricts domestic trade and increases consumer prices.====This paper makes a number of contributions to the existing literature. First, Jones Act studies often rely on general equilibrium models to estimate the welfare effects of eliminating the Act (Francois et al., 1996; USITC, 2002; Swisher et al., 2015).==== The downside of this approach is that the magnitude of these estimates depend heavily on the assumptions of the model and thus vary substantially, ranging from USITC's (1991) welfare gains of $10 billion, to Francois et al.'s (1996) estimate of $3 billion, to Swisher et al.'s (2015) estimate of $1.9 billion, to USITC (2002) $656 million estimate. Other studies have been critical of this approach (GAO, 1998) and these findings (Beason et al., 2015), and argue that “verifiable estimates of the effects of the Act, or its modification, are not available” (GAO, 2013). This paper takes a different approach by using a reduced form empirical analysis and detailed data on Jones Act ships and domestic and international trade to estimate the economic implications of the Jones Act.====Second, a wide variety of policy papers have discussed the effects of the Jones Act. For instance, some studies focus on how the Jones Act affects particular locations, like Alaska (GAO, 1988) and Puerto Rico (NY Fed, 2012; GAO, 2013). An overview of the Jones Act and a discussion of its implications is provided in Frittelli, 2003, Frittelli, 2014, Frittelli, 2015, Frittelli, 2017, Frittelli, 2019, Grennes (2017), and UNCTAD (2017). These papers offer interesting case studies, helpful background information, and a variety of anecdotal evidence. I contribute to this literature by using econometric techniques to provide a careful assessment of whether the Jones Act has adversely affected the U.S. economy.====Third, this paper contributes to a broader academic literature on transportation costs and trade. Existing empirical studies have shown that evolving transportation costs influence trade flows, but the source of these changes is typically infrastructure improvements (Michaels, 2008; Duranton et al., 2014; Redding and Turner, 2015, and Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2016) or technological change (Hummels, 2007; Pascali, 2017, and Feyer, 2019) rather than a domestic trade policy like the Jones Act.==== Consistent with Donaldson (2018) who finds that improvements in transportation infrastructure increase domestic trade and decrease prices, I find that a policy that impedes transportation reduces domestic trade and increases prices. Numerous studies focus on the implications of trade policies more generally (see Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2016 for an overview), but what is unique about the Jones Act is that it affects domestic trade rather than international trade. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis that examines the economic implications of this cabotage law.====The paper proceeds as follows. The historical details of the Jones Act and the rise of the Asian shipbuilding industry are discussed in Section 2. The implications of these changes on the fleet of American ships is documented in Section 3. This section also provides a variety of descriptive statistics showing how American goods are transported and how this varies across states. A cross-sectional analysis examining the impact of the Jones Act on domestic water trade is pursued in Section 4, while a panel analysis exploiting the decline in Jones Act ships over the sample period is the focus of Section 5. Section 6 identifies a causal effect using an instrumental variable approach. All of these empirical strategies show that the Jones Act has disproportionately reduced domestic waterborne trade. Finally, Section 7 provides some concluding thoughts.",Cabotage sabotage?

How have these changes been distributed across income groups? These important questions bear directly on current public policy debates over the effects of globalization and international trade on U.S. consumers. Recent research has emphasized the importance of using models in which different income groups can consume goods in different proportions (non-homotheticity), with the consequence that price indexes are income group-specific.====In this paper, we develop a household-level cost of living index based on non-homothetic preferences, and, using detailed trade transaction data from 1998 to 2014, estimate an import price index for different U.S. income deciles. Our structural approach is necessary because it is not possible to build income-group specific import price indexes solely from available U.S. data.==== To our knowledge, we are the first paper to estimate an import price index by income group for the United States.====Consumer behavior is modeled by a two-tiered nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution demand system. At the upper-tier, non-homotheticity is captured by taste parameters that vary by household, which allow for differences in sectoral expenditure shares across income deciles. At the lower tier, varieties are purchased according to elasticities of substitution that are sector-specific but common across deciles.====We apply the model to trade data containing import prices and consumer survey data containing expenditure shares for different income groups. For prices, we take unit values from the universe of foreign suppliers exporting to the United States from 1998 to 2014, where each of 2.6 million individual foreign supplier-HS10 observations per year is taken as an individual variety. Standard import price indexes typically rely on country-product level observations, so our use of supplier-level trade data means that we have far more precise information about pricing, especially across suppliers within a country. We find that simple averages of the unit values from our data strongly resembles Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) averages from survey data on actual quoted import prices, implying that disaggregated unit values are a valid tool to study trends in import prices. We further discipline the model using income-decile expenditure data from the BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey. The expenditure data show that even though the share of total expenditure spent on imports is fairly constant across income groups, there are significant differences in the sectoral composition of imported consumption across income groups (i.e., non-homotheticity).====Estimation of the model parameters proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the parameters of the lower-tier demand functions using our trade data at the supplier-product level. In the second stage, we estimate the parameters of the upper-tier demand functions at the household level, using both the trade data and the expenditure data.====Before generating import prices using our full model, we first construct a benchmark: a simple Laspeyres price index that corresponds to a first-order approximation of an arbitrary upper-tier demand function. This benchmark shuts down substitution effects by simply weighting sectoral import price indices by (initial period) decile-specific sectoral expenditure shares. Such a first-order approximation approach has been used to study the role of trade in consumption inequalities since Porto (2006), and most recently by Borusyak and Jaravel (2017). For our Laspeyres price index, import prices increased by about 43% from 1998 to 2014 for the ninth income decile, or 2.26% per year. The first decile experienced import price inflation of about 38% from 1998 to 2014, or 2.02% per year.====In contrast, our core finding from the fully specified model is that lower income households experienced the most import price inflation, while higher income households experienced the least import price inflation during our time period. For example, in our baseline results the first income decile experienced import price inflation of about 33% from 1998 to 2014, or 1.82% per year. For comparison, the ninth income decile only experienced import price inflation of about 21% over that time period, or 1.20% per year.====Compared to the Laspeyres benchmark, therefore, we find an upward bias in measured inflation from using a first-order approximation, as would be expected given the absence of sectoral substitution over time. Our main results also demonstrate that such bias is not constant across income deciles in our setting. Indeed, the upward bias for the first income decile is 0.2 percentage points per year, compared to an upward bias of about 0.6 percentage points per year for the median and about 1.1 percentage points per year for the highest income decile. As a result, a standard Laspeyres price index understates differences in import price inflation across deciles.====The result that lower income households faced higher import price inflation is robust to a number of specifications. We find that import prices of non-food, non-energy products exhibit the same patterns as the overall import prices, with the lowest income households facing the highest level of inflation. We also show that Chinese imports held down import price inflation in the U.S. over our time period, but not differentially across income groups. As such, our results suggest that the imported consumption channel may not have mitigated the distributional effects of U.S. trade with China that have occurred through the nominal income channel as documented in Autor et al. (2016), Pierce and Schott (2016), Chetverikov et al. (2016), and the related literature.====Most of the work on constructing import price indexes uses homothetic preferences (e.g., Feenstra (1994), Broda and Weinstein (2006), Khandelwal (2010), Hallak and Schott (2011), Hsieh et al. (2016), Amiti et al. (2017), Feenstra and Weinstein (2017)). Of course, homothetic preferences preclude any focus on distributional issues across consumers.==== We use non-homothetic preferences, which allow us to study import price inflation across different household income groups.====The economics literature has highlighted two forms of non-homotheticity. First, there is sector-level non-homotheticity (e.g., Neary (2004), Caron et al. (2014), Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016), Cravino and Levchenko (2017)), which reflects differences in sectoral expenditure shares across income groups. Second, there is variety-level non-homotheticity (e.g., Fajgelbaum et al. (2011), Li (2012), Handbury (2013), Feenstra and Romalis (2014)), which the literature has associated with differences in product quality. Although data limitations make studying variety-level non-homotheticity difficult in our context, we exactly match sector-level non-homotheticity from data on sectoral expenditure shares by income decile from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey.====Recent papers have used scanner data to study related questions (e.g., Faber (2014), Jaravel (2016), Atkin et al. (2018), Borusyak and Jaravel (2017), Faber and Fally (2017)). However, standard U.S. scanner datasets capture only about 40% of goods expenditures in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (Broda and Weinstein (2010)), and do not include most consumer durable products (e.g., cars, cellphones, computers, furniture, apparel). Such datasets also lack country of origin data. In contrast, the trade data we use captures the universe of U.S. goods imports at the supplier level, and allows us to clearly observe the country of origin. To our knowledge, ours is the first paper to estimate import price indexes by income group for the United States.====The most closely related papers to ours are Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) and Borusyak and Jaravel (2017). Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) use non-homothetic Almost Ideal Demand and aggregate trade data from many countries to estimate how different income groups in these countries would gain or lose from a counterfactual move to autarky. They find that U.S. consumers in the first decile of income would face a much larger price index increase from moving to autarky than consumers in the ninth decile of income. Borusyak and Jaravel (2017) study how a counterfactual 10% reduction in U.S. trade barriers would affect the wages and consumer price indexes of college graduates and those workers without a college degree, using a log-linear approximation approach. They find that the counterfactual's effect on prices is biased in favor of college graduates, but small enough in magnitude that they conclude that this channel is distributionally neutral. A limitation of this first-order approximation approach is that it omits the effect of gains from product variety, or substitution across either varieties or sectors, on the price indexes of different consumers. Our results show that higher-order effects captured in our full nonlinear approach (specifically substitution effects) are quantitatively important and omitting these effects meaningfully affects measured import price inflation.====In sum, our paper makes three main contributions to the literature. First, our use of supplier-level price data within HS10 products allows us to capture heterogeneity in prices across suppliers within exporting countries. Second, we extend a standard import price estimation methodology to account for non-homotheticity and estimate its parameters. Finally, we document a robust pattern of higher import price inflation for lower-income U.S. households, contributing to our understanding of the distributional consequences of international trade through consumption effects.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the model. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 explains our identification strategy and discusses our parameter estimation results. Section 5 presents our import price indexes.

This framework offers interpretations for GATT/WTO negotiations that lower tariff caps as well as for other key GATT/WTO design features. It does not, however, provide an easy interpretation for the WTO's strong restrictions on export subsidies. In addition, despite the explosion of research on gains from trade in heterogeneous-firms models, only a small literature as yet has analyzed trade policies in such models. Motivated by these and other considerations, we analyze trade policies in the heterogeneous-firms model of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008). Among other findings, we identify conditions under which countries have unilateral incentives to introduce beggar-thy-neighbor export subsidies.====While export subsidies were treated in a fairly permissive manner in the early years of GATT, they are banned (with certain exceptions) in the WTO.==== By contrast, WTO member countries are free to impose positive (non-discriminatory) import tariffs that do not exceed their respective negotiated tariff caps. From the perspective of the standard terms-of-trade model, the relatively severe treatment of export subsidies in the WTO is puzzling. A higher import tariff typically generates a negative terms-of-trade externality for a country's trading partner, whereas a higher export subsidy normally provides the partner with a positive terms-of-trade externality. Indeed, the standard terms-of-trade model suggests that governments with political-economic objectives “under-supply” export subsidies in comparison to the level that would be efficient from their joint perspective. This implication contrasts sharply with the WTO's prohibition of export subsidies, indicating either that the rules on export subsidies are too severe or that the standard theory is missing something important. In this context, it is of particular interest to explore any new implications that heterogeneous-firms models may provide as regards the use and treatment of export subsidies.====We consider a symmetric, two-country version of the Melitz-Ottaviano model, which we modify slightly to include ad valorem import and export tariffs. In this model, firms observe trade policies, decide whether or not to incur the fixed cost associated with entry, observe their productivity realizations, and engage in monopolistic competition. Consumer preferences are described by a quadratic utility function that is defined over a continuum of varieties and that exhibits “love of variety.” The two markets are segmented, and a firm that locates in one market incurs a trade cost when exporting to the other market. As Melitz and Ottaviano show, a reduction in trade costs impacts the selection of firms into the domestic and export markets. The least productive firms are forced to exit, and product variety increases. We allow that trade also may be subject to import and export tariffs. Unlike changes in “wasteful” trade costs, changes in tariffs have tariff-revenue implications and also impact welfare through this channel. We assume that tariff revenue is re-distributed to consumers in a lump-sum fashion.====The model has two sectors. In addition to the differentiated-goods sector, the model includes an outside-good sector. The outside good is freely traded with no trade costs and serves as the numeraire good. It is supplied at constant unit cost by a competitive industry. Markups thus vary not just among firms in the differentiated-goods sector but also across sectors. In the absence of domestic policy instruments, the cross-sectoral dispersion in markups suggests a possible role for trade policy in directing resources toward the differentiated-goods sector. This intuition, however, is incomplete, since as we show excessive entry into the differentiated-goods sector can occur without policy interventions.====To develop our findings, we highlight three driving forces in the model. The first effect is a ====: an increase in country ====’s import tariff or in country ====’s export tariff results in a lower cut-off cost level for domestic sales in country ==== and an increase in the cut-off cost level for domestic sales in country ====. The second and related effect is a ====: an increase in country ====’s import tariff or in country ====’s export tariff likewise leads to an increase in the number of entrants into country ====, a decrease in the number of entrants into country ====, an increase in the number of varieties sold in country ====, and a decrease in the number of varieties sold in country ====. An important implication of these findings is that the model generates a ====: an increase in country ====’s import tariff or in country ====’s export tariff results in a decrease in the average price in country ==== and an increase in the average price in country ====.==== Finally, for the closed-economy version of the model, we decompose the externalities that would be generated were a social planner to raise entry beyond the level provided by the market. The ==== from additional entry derives in expectation from the direct consumer surplus gain from a new variety, the consumer surplus loss on pre-existing varieties, the benefit of an increase in the number of varieties, and a business-stealing effect. We sign each of these components and find that the sign of the net externality is determined by a simple relationship among model parameters, with a negative (positive) externality existing if and only if a demand parameter ==== is above (below) a critical level, where ==== impacts the substitution level between the differentiated varieties and the outside good. A negative (positive) externality indicates that the market provides excessive (insufficient) entry into the differentiated-goods sector.====After highlighting these forces, we turn to the paper's primary focus and derive several trade-policy results. We assume that each country evaluates trade policies from the perspective of its national welfare, which in this model is summarized by the consumer surplus enjoyed on the differentiated-goods sector plus income, where trade policy influences income by generating tariff revenue or subsidy expenses. The model entails free entry, and so profits do not enter into the country's welfare function.====For our first set of results, we assume that countries start at global free trade and consider the implications of small, unilateral trade-policy changes. We first show that a country can gain by imposing a small import tariff, since it thereby generates a lower average domestic price, greater domestic variety and tariff revenue. Second, we also identify conditions under which a country can gain by introducing a small export subsidy. A country contemplating the introduction of a small export subsidy faces a tradeoff: an export subsidy generates entry and lowers the average price while expanding variety in the intervening country, but it also gives rise to a subsidy expense. We find that the intervening country gains from the introduction of a small export subsidy if selection effects are strong in that trade costs are small and the dispersion of productivity is high. A small export subsidy also can be attractive when selection effects are weak if in addition the demand parameter ==== that describes the relative appeal of the differentiated-goods sector is not too high. Third, we show that a country can gain by introducing a small import tariff and export tariff, where the tariffs are calibrated to keep the domestic cut-off cost level, and thus the average price and level of variety in the domestic market, constant. This intervention maintains a constant domestic consumer surplus for the differentiated-goods sector while also generating tariff revenue (on both imports and exports).====All three of the described interventions are beggar-thy-neighbor interventions: starting at global free trade, when a country introduces a small import tariff, a small export subsidy, or combined small import and export tariffs of the described kind, its trading partner suffers a reduction in welfare. While the unilateral appeal of a small export subsidy is dependent upon model parameters, the negative international externality that is associated with such a policy is not. The key point is that all of the described policy interventions raise the cut-off cost level in the foreign country and thus increase the average price and reduce the level of variety in this country.====These findings support a relationship between key trade cost and dispersion parameters in the heterogeneous-firms literature and the nature of optimal trade-policy interventions. Our export-subsidy findings are perhaps of greatest interest. We find that a country has incentive to introduce such a policy when trade costs are low and productivity dispersion is great, a setting which may be more likely in the current era and perhaps for some sectors more than others. Our findings also offer a partial perspective on the WTO's prohibition of export subsidies. To the extent that governments use trade agreements to limit the scope in the long run for beggar-thy-neighbor policies, our findings suggest that restrictions on export subsidies could be attractive once governments have achieved through preceding negotiations an outcome that is sufficiently close to global free trade.====We next consider efficient trade policies. We show that countries can use tariffs to effect lump-sum transfers, which implies that efficiency is measured by the sum of the two countries' welfare functions. We then show that the logic of the entry-externality effect extends to the two-country model of trade. Starting at global free trade, the impact on efficiency of a small increase in any tariff, or of a small and symmetric increase in the overall trade barrier between countries, is determined by a simple relationship among model parameters, with an efficiency gain (loss) occurring if and only if the demand parameter ==== is above (below) a critical level, indicating that the market provides excessive (insufficient) entry under global free trade. Thus, if entry is excessive under free trade, then a restriction on the introduction of small export subsidies would be efficiency enhancing, at least once countries get sufficiently close to free trade. For this setting, the model therefore provides an efficiency-based rationale for a prohibition on the use of export subsidies. Furthermore, such a restriction could be effective: even when entry is excessive at free trade, the introduction of a small export subsidy could be unilaterally attractive to the intervening country. When the market provides excessive entry at free trade, however, the model does not provide a similar efficiency-based rationale for caps on import tariffs.====We offer as well characterizations of Nash policies. Such characterization are relatively complicated, since an evaluation of a small tariff change starting at non-zero tariffs requires consideration of the tariff-revenue changes attributable to changes in entry levels. We show that, if the overall trade barrier is symmetric across the two directions of trade and the joint-welfare function is quasi-concave in this symmetric barrier, then the symmetric Nash equilibrium entails a higher-than-efficient overall trade barrier. Hence, starting at the symmetric Nash equilibrium, countries can mutually gain by exchanging small reductions in import tariffs, export tariffs or combinations thereof. Our findings here provide a possible interpretation for why early GATT rounds emphasized negotiated reductions in import tariffs while taking a more permissive stance toward export subsidies.====We also provide results about the levels of Nash import and export tariffs. If the joint-welfare function is quasi-concave and model parameters are such that the market does not provide insufficient entry under free trade, then, in a symmetric Nash equilibrium, the import tariff must be higher than the export tariff. We also establish a limiting result: as the trade cost goes to infinity, the Nash import tariff converges to a positive number while the limiting sign of the Nash export tariff is positive (negative) if the market provides excessive (insufficient) entry under free trade. Thus, a Nash export subsidy is implied when the trade cost is sufficiently high and the market provides insufficient entry.====We also show that welfare functions can be expressed as functions of local and world prices. Representing welfare functions in this way, we show that Nash tariffs are inefficient but that “politically optimal” tariffs are efficient. Our analysis thus indicates a sense in which the terms-of-trade externality represents the fundamental reason for a trade agreement in the Melitz-Ottaviano model. This finding complements previous findings as surveyed by Bagwell and Staiger (2016b) for settings with perfect competition and for settings with imperfect competition and homogeneous firms. We thus offer here a first demonstration that politically optimal policies are efficient for a heterogeneous-firms model. From this perspective, we conclude that firm heterogeneity does not provide a new rationale for trade agreements; at the same time, we emphasize that the design of the trade agreement (e.g., whether restrictions on export subsidies are desirable) may be impacted by parameters that describe the dispersion of heterogeneity.====Our theoretical analysis raises two robustness issues. First, to what extent would our findings generalize were consumer preferences regarding the differentiated-goods sector instead described by a CES function? We explore this issue in a sequel paper, Bagwell and Lee (2018). There, we conduct a similar analysis of trade policies in a two-sector model with quasi-linear utility but with two main differences: consumer utility in the differentiated-goods sector is captured by a CES function, and, following Melitz (2003), selection is achieved as a consequence of fixed production costs.==== Many trade-policy findings hold in common across the two models; however, a key difference is that the entry-externality effect is always positive in the CES model. Hence, if countries start at global free trade, then for the CES model the introduction of an export subsidy always benefits the intervening country and ==== joint welfare. Starting at global free trade, the CES model thus differs in that it does not provide an efficiency-based rationale for a restriction on export subsidies. In Section 7, we discuss the underlying source of the different entry-externality effects across the two models.====Second, what is the role of the outside-good sector? To explore this question, one possible comparison is with a single-sector Melitz-Ottaviano model in which the outside-good sector is removed. The two models represent opposite extreme cases, in that the supply of labor to the differentiated-goods sector is perfectly elastic when the outside-good sector is included and perfectly inelastic when the outside-good sector is eliminated. The outside-good model thus eliminates general-equilibrium wage effects associated with trade-policy changes, whereas the potential significance of such effects is heightened in the single-sector model. From this perspective, the two models are complementary, with the preferred model depending on the situation. As one example, the outside-good model seems reasonable when analyzing trade policies for specific sectors, such as is often the case in WTO disputes, since sector-based trade policies would seem less likely to generate economy-wide wage effects.====Some formal results vary across these two modeling frameworks. Notably, in the single-sector version of the Melitz-Ottaviano model, Demidova (2017) finds that entry is unaffected by tariffs and the Metzler paradox no longer holds. She also finds that the optimal unilateral import tariffs are positive for both small and large countries. While Demidova does not study export policies, an apparent implication based on Lerner-symmetry arguments is that the single-sector model cannot account for unilateral export subsidies. In a sequel paper, Bagwell and Lee (2020), we note that entry can be affected by entry tax/subsidy policies, and we show for a closed-economy model that the market level of entry is (locally) efficient in the single-sector version of the Melitz-Ottaviano model. Hence, the entry-externality effect characterized in this paper does not arise in the single-sector version.====Ultimately, the relevance of the Metzler paradox is an empirical issue. In the empirical literature on tariff pass-through, the recent study by Ludema and Yu (2016) is of particular interest. Using comprehensive and detailed transaction-level export data for many firms, products and destinations, they examine the response of US export prices to foreign tariff cuts at the firm level for a period of time over which the Uruguay Round was implemented. They find that the pass-through of the average firm is typically negative, in line with the Metzler paradox. They argue, however, that this is partly due to quality upgrading, whereby U.S. firms responded to foreign tariff cuts by upgrading quality and increasing export prices. They thus find evidence in support of a “quasi-Metzler paradox.”====Another useful comparison is with a two-sector version of the Melitz-Ottaviano model in which the outside-good sector is replaced with another differentiated-goods sector. In Bagwell and Lee (2020), we also consider a two-sector model of this kind. We assume that the upper-tier utility function is additively separable across sectors and allow that the sectors differ only in terms of the demand parameter ====, so that ==== ≠ ====. Even though the two sectors have the same average mark-up, we identify a small perturbation from the market level of entry that generates a welfare gain by reallocating entry out of the “high-demand” (i.e., high-====) sector in such a fashion as to keep the (endogenous) marginal utility of income constant. This finding, described in greater detail in Section 8, shares qualitative features with the entry-externality effect characterized in this paper, wherein entry into the differentiated-goods sector is excessive if ==== is above a threshold level.",Trade policy under monopolistic competition with firm selection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300945,29 August 2020,2020,Research Article,148.0

Discrepancies in long-run beliefs dilute current prices differently. Negative long-run beliefs become self-fulfilling if the sovereign optimally borrows more and defaults more frequently in the face of worse prices. A strong curvature in the flow utility is an important ingredient in generating this response. The intuition bears out both through a multiplicity of Markov equilibria and in sunspot equilibria that mimic trigger strategies in repeated games. In the benchmark model, average spreads are roughly 67% higher (200 basis points) and debt-to-GDP ratios are roughly 9% higher (5 percentage points) when beliefs are pessimistic. The model also reveals limitations to third-party coordination of expectations as a policy tool.","Ever since the seminal contribution of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), there has been a folk intuition in the sovereign debt and default literature that market sentiments can have real effects. The intuition is as follows: When investors expect the sovereign to default they demand a high spread, which makes repayment costly and raises the default frequency; on the other hand, when lenders do not expect a default they demand a low spread, which reduces the burden of repayment and with it the default frequency.====Most often these self-fulfilling dynamics have been modeled as a relatively short-run phenomenon. One common form is a liquidity crisis or a failed auction (Cole and Kehoe, 1996 or Rodrik and Velasco, 1999), in which the country is unable to roll over a large fraction of short-term debt since investors anticipate default; another is an inefficient auction (Calvo, 1988, Beetsma, 1996, Corsetti and Dedola, 2013, or Farhi and Maggiori, 2016), wherein the government could issue less debt but generate more revenue since the percentage increase in the price would be greater than the percentage decrease in the quantity.====I show that this intuition holds with long-run expectations as well when the debt is long term. The impact of sentiments is not restricted to a particular quarter or auction. This is because pessimistic predictions regarding long-run outcomes, such as future indebtedness or propensity to repay, can become self-fulfilling by influencing behavior today.====Here is a simple example to illustrate this: Consider a country that operates in long-maturity debt markets. Suppose that its foreign investors suddenly believed, for no fundamental reason, that this country would fare poorly over the long-term. In particular, they believed that this country would become saddled with high debt levels and more inclined to default on foreign obligations. Because the debt is of long-maturity, these investors would price in this expected risk and long-maturity debt prices would fall. These negative beliefs can become self-fulfilling if the country is sufficiently unwilling to delever in response to this drop in prices. If instead he borrows more to avoid a painful fiscal consolidation, then he will enter the future with a greater debt burden. The additional cost of servicing this greater debt burden will make him more likely to default, thus justifying lenders' initial spontaneous fears.====In this paper I document the presence and analyze the properties of stationary Markov equilibria==== that exhibit dynamics such as these in a quantitative model of long-term sovereign debt. I begin by assuming deterministic beliefs and exploring conditions under which the intuition outlined above gives rise to a multiplicity of Markov equilibria. In one of these equilibria, the sovereign is typically more indebted and defaults more often than in the other.====The translation from greater indebtedness and default risk to lower prices follows mechanically from competitive pricing of the debt. The non-trivial hurdle in sustaining self-fulfilling dynamics is ensuring that the sovereign would not undergo significant fiscal consolidation and delever in response to these lower prices. I find that a large degree of curvature in the flow utility function typically suffices to generate this response. In this case, the marginal disutility associated with consolidation is much greater than the marginal cost of increased additional future debt service and default frequency. Thus, the sovereign levers up in response to negative expectations, which justifies them.====The presence of equilibrium multiplicity alone does not suggest that belief fluctuations generate additional volatility in prices our quantities, only that there are multiple ways the same agents in a given economy can coordinate. But it is well-known that in the presence of equilibrium multiplicity one can typically construct sunspot==== equilibria that randomize over them (Cass and Shell, 1983 or Cole and Kehoe, 1996). In such equilibria, stochastic belief fluctuations can have real effects such as those outlined earlier.====I show that this can be taken further in the case of long-term sovereign debt models with re-entry. Sunspot equilibria that exhibit the same self-fulfilling dynamics outlined above can be constructed that are not a randomization over a multiplicity of fundamental equilibria.====This is done by treating the default event as a ‘trigger.’ The sovereign is punished for defaulting by collective coordination on the ‘bad’ sunspot, which implies low prices, high indebtedness, and overall lower welfare upon re-entry to credit markets. This increases the cost of defaulting in the ‘good’ sunspot, which in equilibrium delivers better prices than the sovereign could attain even the low-debt fundamental equilibrium.==== Equilibria like this can only be sustained when one allows for re-entry to capital markets, since only in this case can default serve as a trigger for coordination on poor prices.==== In this case, though, the distinct belief regimes have monotonicity properties not shared by distinct fundamental equilibria. This generates different policy and welfare implications, which I will explore in some depth.====As there is no asymmetry of information in my analysis, assumptions regarding off-equilibrium beliefs are neither required nor relevant. Further, in the case of equilibrium multiplicity, I maintain the assumption throughout that beliefs never shift to the other equilibrium. Belief fluctuations will only occur in the trigger-strategy sunspot equilibrium, wherein sunspot fluctuations are expected with some positive probability.====The quantitative results reveal that fluctuations in beliefs are not a mere theoretical curiosity. I solve the model using off-the-shelf calibration of Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012) adjusted only to incorporate more curvature in the flow utility until beliefs play a real role. In the benchmark trigger-strategy model, average spreads are roughly 67% higher (200 basis points) under pessimistic long-run beliefs. Pessimistic beliefs also induce a worsening of the fiscal situation, pushing the average debt-to-GDP ratio up by roughly 9% (5 percentage points). Bad fundamental shocks, on the other hand, tend to incentivize consolidation and deleveraging (Aguiar et al., 2016).====The model has interesting policy consequences for third party interventions. I consider explicitly the case when a third party such as a central bank or the IMF attempts to coordinate expectations to improve allocations. In the case of equilibrium multiplicity, I find that third party intervention can offer a Pareto improvement ex-ante but can also engender ==== default in certain high-debt states of the world. This occurs because default costs are lower in the ‘good equilibrium’ since the sovereign returns to markets that offer better prices on average. Thus, if the third party is considering an ex-post intervention during a debt crisis, it would damage legacy debt-holders by raising default frequencies and depressing the price of bonds they hold.====Further, in the case of a trigger-strategy equilibrium, a Pareto-dominant coordination is not even possible since the good belief regime is sustained by an unusually high effective default cost, since default triggers a bad belief regime. Were a third party to try to coordinate on good beliefs all the time, the value of default would inevitably rise, and ‘good’ behavior would no longer be optimal on either side of the market.",Beliefs and long-maturity sovereign debt,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300969,28 August 2020,2020,Research Article,149.0
Lashkaripour Ahmad,"Indiana University, USA","Received 19 April 2019, Revised 12 August 2020, Accepted 13 August 2020, Available online 20 August 2020, Version of Record 20 September 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2020.103380,Cited by (7),"This paper uncovers a new type of quality specialization that occurs along the ==== trade-off when choosing their output unit weight. As a result of this trade off, high-wage economies specialize in heavier varieties of a given good, while geographically distant economies specialize in lighter varieties (i.e., ====). Micro-level trade data support these predictions and suggest that weight-based quality specialization can explain a significant portion of the cross-national variation in export prices and export quality. Moreover, accounting for the heterogeneity in export unit weights yields support for the iceberg trade cost assumption, which has proven to be elusive in the past.","An accumulating body of evidence over the past two decades has established that international specialization occurs predominantly ==== rather than ==== product categories. Concurrent with the evidence, there has been a surge in new theories of within-industry specialization. The dominant view underlying these theories is that different countries specialize in low- or high-quality varieties of the same product.====For all their merits, mainstream theories of quality specialization have paid less attention to the determinants of product quality. Existing theories typically model product quality as a one-dimensional, over-arching demand shifter. As noted by Eaton and Fieler (2019) this one-dimensional approach to modeling product quality can limit predictive power in many instances. Furthermore, improving on this approach seems feasible in light of recent research on consumer psychology, which suggests that perception of quality is related to tangible product characteristics that are often observable in the data (Jostmann et al. (2009))====In this paper, I analyze one such overlooked but readily-observable determinant of product quality: ====. My analysis is inspired by an extensive body of research on consumer psychology, which suggests that consumer's perception of quality is strongly linked to a product's physical weight. The same wine or perfume is perceived as higher quality when presented in a heavier bottle (Piqueras-Fiszman and Spence (2012)); heavier vehicles are perceived as safer vehicles (Thomas and Walton (2008)); and metal credits cards are perceived as more luxurious relative to their plastic counterparts (Lindstrom (2006)). More revealing, van Rompay et al. (2014) have analyzed consumer's perception of quality using dummy phones for which product weight is manipulated independently from product appearance. They find that consumers perceive the identical-looking heavier phones as higher quality.====I estimate product quality using detailed trade data, and show that quality increases with physical weight for the vast majority of product categories.==== I also document that heavier varieties of the same product are more costly to produce and transport. These findings indicate that firms face a basic ==== trade-off when choosing the optimal weight of their output. This previously-overlooked trade-off induces low-wage and remote countries to specialize in lighter (lower-quality) varieties of the same product. I label this type of specialization as ==== and show that it accounts for a large portion of the cross-national variation in export price and quality.====In Section 2, I use micro-level trade data from the U.S. and Colombia to document a set of new regularities regarding the physical unit weight of traded goods. My analysis concerns indivisible or discrete goods like “Transport Equipment,” “Machinery,” and “Electronics & Appliances,” which (a) account for more than 50% of global trade and (b) come with a pre-determined factory gate unit weight. Customs data typically reports the count (====) and the net weight (====) of the discrete goods in each import shipment. Using this information, I compute the unit weight (====/====) of the imported goods and document the following five regularities:====Section 3 develops a simple model to study the firms' choice of output unit weight. My theory is based on four primitive assumptions: (i) output quality is increasing in physical weight as well as intangible attributes like design or marketing that increase the value-to-weight ratio independent of physical weight; (ii) the unit transport cost increases more rapidly with unit weight than the marginal production cost; (iii) transportation employs labor in both the origin and destination countries; and (iv) transportation costs increase with geographical distance.====In this setup, firms choose their output unit weight to maximize profits in each market. The firm's choice is subject to a of basic trade-off: On one hand, by increasing the physical weight of their output variety, firms can increase their product appeal and sales. On the other hand, producing heavier varieties involves using more raw inputs and paying a higher transport cost.====Facing this trade-off, firms located in high-wage economies specialize in the production of heavier varieties. To the extent that heavier varieties are of higher quality, one can perceive this pattern as ==== quality specialization. At the same time, we know from the existing literature that high-wage economies also specialize in intangible dimensions of quality, which increases the value-to-weight ratio of their output conditional on unit weight. That being the case, ==== quality specialization reinforces the other dimensions of quality specialization in high-wage economies.====Firms located in distant economies, meanwhile, specialize in lighter varieties to circumvent the distance-increasing transport costs. At the same time, due to the “Washington Apples Effect”, distant economies tend to upgrade their quality along the intangible dimension in order to increase the value-to-weight ratio of their output. So, in the case of distant economies, ==== quality specialization countervails the ==== quality specialization.====Section 4 presents empirical support for the above predictions. Specifically, the unit weight of country-level exports increases significantly with the exporter's GDP per capita, but decreases with bilateral distance between the trading partners. The value-to-weight ratio of exports, meanwhile, increases significantly with both the exporter's GDP per capita and bilateral distance. Considering this, the effect of GDP per capita on the export unit price (==== × ====) is always positive, whereas the effect of distance on export unit price depends on the relative force of the ==== versus ==== quality specialization.====These findings contribute to a growing literature that studies the anatomy of within-industry specialization (Schott (2004); Hummels and Klenow (2005); Hallak (2006); Khandelwal (2010); Baldwin and Harrigan (2011); Crozet et al. (2012); Johnson (2012); Lugovskyy and Skiba, 2015; Feenstra and Romalis (2014); Sutton (2012); and Dingel (2016)). The existing literature has generally emphasized quality specialization, as a means to explain the tremendous heterogeneity in export price levels within narrowly-defined industries. I argue that a significant amount of the observed price heterogeneity can be explained by weight-based quality specialization.====This paper is also related to a large literature investigating international transport costs (Clark et al. (2004); Hummels and Skiba (2004); Hummels (2007); Blonigen and Wilson (2008); Hummels et al. (2009); Abe and Wilson (2009)). My contribution to this literature is two-fold. The first contribution is highlighting ==== as a key determinant of the unit transport cost.==== The second contribution is using detailed firm-level data to shed fresh light on the determinants of transport costs—in comparison, the prior literature on this topic has mostly relied on country-level data.====Very few studies have directly emphasized physical weight as a driver of international specialization. Alfred Weber’'s classic theory of location choice emphasized that the physical weight of raw material versus final goods determines the optimal location of production (Weber, 1922). More recently, Duranton et al. (2014) have shown that cities with more highways specialize in sectors producing heavy goods. Relatedly, Harrigan (2010) argues that distant suppliers have a comparative advantage in lighter goods; but instead of directly using data on physical unit weight, he classifies light and heavy goods based on value-to-weight ratios.====Finally, the results in this paper present an avenue of optimism for the iceberg trade cost specification. Ever since Samuelson (1954), the aforementioned specification has been widely employed in the quantitative trade literature to preserve multiplicative separability. Recently, though, the iceberg assumption has come under criticism based on evidence derived from actual transport cost data. This paper shows that once we account for the heterogeneity in unit weights, transport costs are quasi-iceberg for discrete goods, which are responsible for more than 50% of global trade.",Weight-based quality specialization,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300957,20 August 2020,2020,Research Article,150.0

This poses potentially large problems for the taxation of capital, since a high tax on capital may lead to capital flight to a country where the tax rate is lower. The risk of capital flight may be even more severe when tax authorities rely mainly on source-based capital taxes, such as corporate income taxes and withholding taxes; this will inevitably be the case if information about capital income is not shared across jurisdictions. Concerns over such “harmful tax competition” have been voiced, for instance, in communiqués by the OECD (1998) and the European Union (2003).====However, recent agreements on information sharing between OECD and EU countries make it more feasible to levy capital taxes according to the residence principle. In particular, the Common Reporting Standard==== is now being implemented, allowing for automatic information sharing between governments. This represents a major shift in the enforceability of residence-based capital taxes, making it more important than ever to understand the non-cooperative use of capital taxes by governments who can deploy both residence- and source-based taxes in the presence of capital mobility. The question we address here is the following: what is the effect of capital market integration on capital taxes when governments can tax according to the residence as well as the source principle?====We address this issue in the context of a multi-country neoclassical growth model with an infinite horizon. Our choice of a fully dynamic model with endogenous capital formation is crucial. In a static model, residence-based (savings) taxes are lump-sum taxes. In a two-period model, the tax externalities are very different from those in a fully dynamic model, as we emphasized in Gross et al. (2017) in a context where only source-based taxes can be used. This difference may be even more pronounced when residence-based taxes are also available because of their effect on the rates of return to savings, thereby on capital accumulation, and hence the global supply of capital over time. We restrict our attention to the case of perfect commitment, in order to establish a benchmark.====We prove analytically that, at any interior steady state, all capital taxes are zero. This result is quite important for our study: When countries have the same subjective discount factor, a non-degenerate steady state only exists if residence-based capital taxes are identical across countries—otherwise the country with the highest after-tax rate of return will, in the limit, own the entire global stock of wealth. Therefore, if countries were to differ in endowments, technology, or their agents' preferences, and if these differences were to result in different choices of residence-based capital taxes, then the world economy would not converge to a non-degenerate wealth distribution. However, because we show that all countries choose the same long-run residence-based capital tax rate (zero) regardless of asymmetries, we can sensibly study environments where countries differ in more or less arbitrary ways, provided only that they have the same subjective discount factor.====Our next finding in this new setting is that, when countries are symmetric or differ with respect to population size and/or productivity only, the equilibrium of a non-cooperative game is identical to the equilibrium in the absence of capital mobility; in other words, it is as if the two economies were closed. We prove this analytically (in an ====-country world) and verify it numerically (in a two-country world). In such an environment, source-based capital income taxes are always zero. The result that source-based capital income taxes are always zero is similar to those by Bucovetsky and Wilson (1991) and Eggert and Haufler (1999), who focus on identical countries, and can thus be seen as an extension of these results from a two-period to an infinite-horizon setting. In our fully dynamic model, however, residence-based capital taxes are only initially high and then go to zero, as in a closed economy.====In consonance with this surprising result, we show that the fiscal externalities associated with source-based capital taxes vanish when residence-based capital income taxes are allowed. This holds even when countries differ with respect to other features than population and productivity.====However, while the fiscal externalities always vanish, when jurisdictions differ with respect to some fundamentals not related to size or productivity, such as the initial asset position, source-based taxes are associated with a terms-of-trade externality, which does not arise for residence-based taxes. This externality, however, is tiny compared to its counterpart when source-based taxes are the only type of capital tax allowed. Importantly, while there are significant welfare costs of capital mobility when only source-based taxes are allowed, we observe small, but positive, welfare gains from capital mobility once savings taxes are available. The reason is that tax competition is no longer harmful, and there are potential gains from (intertemporal) trade. Therefore, increased capital-market integration may not be as problematic as many have feared.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses some of the related literature. Section 4 presents the model framework and defines our equilibrium concept.

Can domestic VAT enforcement impact firms' exporting behaviors? Although several papers (Feldstein and Krugman, 1990; Barbiero et al., 2018) have theoretically analyzed the role of VAT in international trade, there is still very limited empirical evidence related to this topic.==== This paper aims to add to the literature by studying how firms' exporting behaviors change in response to a domestic VAT enforcement policy.====To understand how domestic VAT enforcement influences firms' exporting behaviors, we build a monopolistic competition model in which firms face a convex production cost function and decide their sales across domestic and foreign markets. Firms pay VAT on all their sales, but can reclaim part or all of their VAT paid on exports due to an export rebate policy. Strengthening VAT enforcement therefore increases the cost of domestic sales relative to exports because of export rebates. The model predicts that better VAT enforcement reduces firms' sales in the domestic market and may induce firms to export (extensive margin) and export more (intensive margin). The model further predicts that the effects of VAT enforcement on firms' sales decisions are stronger when the export rebate rate is higher or when firms are more likely to be financially constrained.====We use panel data of Chinese industrial firms between 1998 and 2007 to test the model predictions. Two major challenges exist when we try to identify the causal effects of the VAT policy. First, the ==== VAT rates are uniform across firms in the period of our data sample. Second, the ==== VAT rates, affected by the enforcement of local governments, may be correlated with firms' exporting behaviors. We take advantage of a tax enforcement technology change in China to overcome these two challenges. First, in the late 1990s, Chinese tax officials enforced VAT on local firms mainly through onsite inspections and auditing. Therefore, although firms in the same industry face the same statutory VAT rate, firms located further away from their local tax office (distant firms hereafter), incurring higher travel costs on and consequently less visited by tax officials, are often subject to lower effective VAT rates compared to firms located closer to the local tax office (nearby firms hereafter). Second, China in 2001 began to implement the ==== (GTP), which adopts a technology that obviates the need for tax officials to verify firms' purchases and sales through on-site visits. As a result, evasion of VAT becomes much more difficult for all firms, and firms at various distances to the local tax office no longer face different enforcement probabilities. In other words, the GTP significantly improves VAT enforcement on all Chinese firms, especially the distant firms. We exploit the heterogeneous enforcement shocks that the GTP exerts on firms at different geographic locations to identify the causal effects of the VAT enforcement.====Specifically, we can identify the effects of VAT enforcement on firms' effective VAT rates, exports, and domestic sales by comparing how the changes in these outcomes after the GTP differ across firms at different locations. We find that before the GTP, distant firms pay lower effective rates than nearby firms, and as a result, experience a bigger increase in their effective VAT rates after the introduction of GTP: a 1 standard-deviation increase in a firm's distance to its tax office increases the firm's post-GTP effective VAT rate by approximately 0.1 percentage point. We also find that the rise in effective VAT rate increases firms' exports and reduces their domestic sales: a 1 standard-deviation increase in a firm's distance to its tax office increases its post-GTP exports by 11.7% and reduces its post-GTP domestic sales by 5.2%.====Employing a triple difference strategy, we find that the positive effect of the GTP on firms' exports is more pronounced (i) for products with higher VAT export rebate rates, and (ii) for firms that are more dependent on external finance, located in regions that are financially less developed, or are non-state-owned.====We conduct several robustness checks on our difference-in-differences (DID) estimates. First, we focus on the sample of township and village enterprises, which are less prone to the problem of endogenous firm location. Second, we conduct placebo tests on the subsamples of small VAT payers, pure exporters, and processing firms, which are unaffected by the GTP. These tests falsify any unobservable different over-time changes across firms at different distances to their local tax office. Third, we control for import and export tariffs, VAT rebates, export policy uncertainty, and a set of time-variant variables to alleviate the concern that our results are driven by China's accession to the WTO or other confounding changes correlated with firm location. Lastly, we use alternative measures of firm distance. The results of these tests show high robustness of our estimates and support that our estimates indeed reflect effects of VAT enforcement.====Our paper supplements studies on the effects of domestic institutions on foreign trade. Existing literature has covered contract and property-right (Berkowitz et al., 2006; Nunn, 2007; Levchenko, 2007; Yue et al., 2010), financial (Minetti and Zhu, 2011; Beck, 2002; Manova, 2012; Manova et al., 2015; Chaney, 2016), labor-market (Costinot, 2009), and informal institutions (McMillan and Woodruff, 1999; Rauch and Trindade, 2002; Ding et al., 2018). Our study closely relates to Chandra and Long (2013) in documenting the trade effects of domestic VAT policies. Different from Chandra and Long (2013), who examine how ==== VAT export rebate rate affects exports, we focus on the institution and technology of domestic VAT enforcement, and show that de facto VAT enforcement also has positive effects on firm exports.==== The magnitude of the implied estimated effect of VAT rate on exports, however, is highly similar in our paper and in theirs.====Our finding that domestic VAT policies affect firms' exporting behaviors adds to the general debate of trade neutrality of VAT. In contrast to the VAT trade neutrality result theoretically illustrated in Feldstein and Krugman (1990), our paper finds that domestic VAT enforcement affects firms' exports. There are two reasons to explain the difference. First, Feldstein and Krugman (1990) derive the trade neutrality result based on the assumption that any change in VAT rate or export rebate rate should affect all firms in the VAT country uniformly, so that, in general equilibrium, no firms experience changes in their demands or profitability when the VAT policy changes. In contrast, we focus on a VAT enforcement shock whose effect on effective VAT rate is heterogeneous across firms. Hence, although not explicitly analyzed in our paper, general-equilibrium changes in domestic prices, which should reflect the average VAT change for the whole economy, can no longer perfectly counteract the VAT shock experienced by each individual firm. Second, while Feldstein and Krugman (1990) and Benzarti and Tazhitdinova (2019) focus on aggregate trade flows across countries, our paper studies a within-country ====: our estimates examine how trade effects of the same VAT shock may be heterogeneous across firms within the same trading country.====Finally, our paper relates to the literature on the interdependence of domestic and foreign markets. Existing studies (Nguyen and Schaur, 2012; Vannoorenberghe, 2012; Blum et al., 2013; Soderbery, 2014; Ahn and McQuoid, 2015) provide evidence on the substitution between firms' domestic and export sales: this linkage implies susceptibility of firms' sales in one market to shocks from another market.==== One closely related study is Almunia et al. (2018), who find that the capacity of export market can counteract the negative impact of local demand shocks. Similar to their study, our findings show that, when production cost is convex, taxes on domestic sales can increase firms' incentives to export.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple model to generate predictions for empirical analysis. Section 3 provides background information on China's VAT policy and the GTP. Section 4 discusses the data. Section 5 introduces the empirical strategy. Section 6 presents and discusses the empirical results.

Within monetary unions, these effects are found to be very minor though, at least when online prices are considered. However, analyzing household scanner price data from three euro area member states, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, we document that households face (and pay) significantly different prices for identical goods across these countries in the vast majority (around 75%) of cases considered. For regions within countries, as a counterfactual, however, no evidence for such effects exists. Employing cross-border shopping information, we are able to draw direct conclusions about the question of integration of markets for a substantial number of goods. In addition, we can also derive a measure of border costs for most of them. For goods, for which no cross-border shopping take place, we provide a lower bound for border costs in the majority of cases. In line with existing evidence, our findings suggest considerable heterogeneities in border costs. Median values generally range between 15% and 20% (of the price of a good) for exact border cost estimates and between 18% and 20% for the derived lower bounds.

The migrant needs first to gather information about the attractiveness of the various countries she could opt for. However, some of the seminal contributions to the modeling of the determinants of migration choice assume that uncertainty is fully (and costlessly) resolved before deciding where to migrate.==== In particular, this is the case for the canonical micro-foundations of migration gravity equations that rely on discrete choice models ==== McFadden (McFadden, 1974). In contrast, there is empirical evidence revealing that potential migrants can have inaccurate expectations on their earnings abroad (McKenzie et al., 2013) or about the costs and risks associated to migrating (Shrestha, 2020).====This suggests that the uncertainty surrounding the utility at destination might not be entirely resolved when a migrant has to come up with a decision, and the size of the remaining uncertainty could be endogenously determined. The literature on rational inattention (Sims, 1998, Sims, 2003), which has been recently applied to discrete choice situations (Matějka and McKay, 2015; Caplin et al., 2019), provides us with a framework to think about how costs associated to information acquisition and processing would influence the specification of the migration gravity equation that is brought to the data.====How can we enhance our understanding of the determinants of international migration flows if we take into account the uncertainty that migrants face, and the costly actions that they can take to narrow it down? We estimate a gravity equation whose specification is derived from the analysis of a location-decision problem with information frictions. We obtain a closed-form expression for optimal choice probabilities under suitable assumptions on the priors held by the migrants about the distribution of destination-specific utility, following Dasgupta and Mondria (2018).==== The main testable implication of this model is that the responsiveness of bilateral migration flows with respect to variations in the attractiveness of alternative destinations is larger when migrants have a stronger incentive to acquire information before deciding where to move. We refer to this incentive as the value of information, which is related to the ratio between the variance of the prior distribution of destination-specific utility and the marginal cost of receiving signals about the actual attractiveness of the various alternatives in the choice set. The distribution of past migration flows across destinations can be used to infer the (unobserved) value of information, and we exploit this property to estimate the model.====We draw on data on bilateral migration flows between 1960 and 2015 from Abel (2018) to build an origin-specific and time-varying measure of the value of information for international migrants, which is inversely related to the share of cumulated past flows directed to the main destination.==== We estimate a gravity equation where the destination-specific utility depends on an interaction between income per capita at destination and our empirical counterpart of the value of information. The results are in line with the theoretical model: a one standard deviation increase in our proxy for the value of information determines an increase in the estimated elasticity between 0.063 and 0.083.==== Our estimates imply that the elasticity of the bilateral migration rate with respect to income per capita for China is 0.182–0.241 higher than the corresponding elasticity for Mexico, which represents a paradigmatic case of migration flows concentrated in just one single destination, namely the United States. Our results are robust when we exclude the main origin-specific destination from the sample, so that they are are not driven by a lower procyclicality of the migration flows directed to just one destination but rather, as the theory predicts, to all foreign countries. Our results are inconsistent with the predictions stemming from a canonical random utility maximization model with unobserved heterogeneity where the variance of the stochastic component of utility is origin-specific. This alternative full-information model would imply that the coefficient of our interaction term should have the opposite sign to the one that we obtain when estimating our gravity equation.====The econometric evidence that we provide is fully robust when we allow for additional heterogeneity in the coefficient of income at destination either across origins or at the dyadic level. Specifically, we let this coefficient vary also with the level of income of the migrant-sending country, with its past total emigration rate, and with dyadic correlates of migration costs, such as the size of migrant networks at destination, geographic, cultural or linguistic distance. This, in turn, implies that our results cannot be explained by a full-information model with a richer and more flexible specification of the deterministic component of utility where the effect of income at destination depends in a multiplicative way on other variables, which might also be correlated with the past distribution of flows across destinations. Thus, the results of the estimation of our theory-based gravity equation suggest that variations in economic conditions in a given destination country influence more incoming migration flows from origins where migrants (rationally) invest more in information acquisition.====This paper is mainly related to two strands of literature, namely (====) the theoretical analyses of discrete choice models with costly information acquisition (Matějka and McKay, 2015; Caplin et al., 2019; Fosgerau et al., 2020; Steiner et al., 2017), and (====) the analysis of the determinants of international migration flows through micro-founded specifications of the gravity equation (see, for instance, Mayda, 2010; Grogger and Hanson, 2011; Bertoli and Moraga, 2013; Ortega and Peri, 2013).==== With respect to (====), we make three distinct contributions to the literature on rational inattention. First, we prove that all alternatives are chosen with positive probability==== once we assume that utility is identically and independently distributed according to a conjugate of a Gumbel distribution (Cardell, 1997) around a destination-specific expected value.==== Second, we show that the optimal total investment in information acquisition is negatively related to the expected utility associated to the alternative that is, a priori, the most attractive, but that the migrant chooses to receive more informative (and hence costly) signals about the alternatives that are less likely to be selected. This latter theoretical result is reminiscent of the evidence about the redirection of attention towards less attractive options in the so-called lemon-dropping markets in Bartoš et al. (2016). Third, we provide evidence of the empirical relevance of rational inattention in discrete choice situations, complementing a strand of literature that is still mostly theoretical.==== Migrants appear to be rationally inattentive even though the stakes related to their location decisions are certainly very high (see, for instance, McKenzie et al., 2010 and Clemens et al., 2019).====As far as (====) is concerned, ours is the first paper bringing to the data a migration gravity equation derived from a model with information frictions, with Porcher (2019) being the only other paper we are aware of, in his case exploiting internal migration flows in Brazil. Furthermore, we make two main contributions. First, we demonstrate that an alternative micro-foundation of the migration gravity equation allows for uncovering and interpreting systematic heterogeneities across origins in the responsiveness of migration flows with respect to varying economic conditions in the various destination countries. Second, our analysis implies an additional reason why migration flows have an inertial character, over and above the positive externalities generated due to destination-specific migration networks (e.g., Munshi, 2003), as information frictions induce a more concentrated distribution of migrants across destinations.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces information frictions in a standard location-choice problem, solving it under suitable distributional assumptions, and deriving its testable implications; Section 3 briefly presents the main data sources, it describes how we bring the model to the data, and it presents basic descriptive statistics.

This prediction finds support from micro-level trade data. I then map the discrete model to macro-level data and show that the unique forces underlying the model shed fresh light on the gains from trade and the “big-push” effects of globalization.,"Around 50% of all U.S. import transactions from 1989 to 2015 involved ==== goods such as “Transport Equipment”, “Electronics & Appliances,” and “Machinery.” A defining feature of these goods is that they are ==== and durable. That is, consumers can purchase discrete goods, like cars, smartphones, or washer-dryers, in only integer quantities. However, once purchased, these goods supply a continuous flow of transportation, communication, or laundry services.====Indivisibility of this kind has sharp implications for consumer choice. Most importantly, consumers cannot buy a fraction of multiple discrete goods. They are instead left with two options: (====) pay the price of one full unit, which is akin to paying a fixed acquisition cost; or (====) purchase a service that can substitute for such goods. They can also combine these two options. For instance, a consumer may purchase a personal vehicle for day-to-day use and spend the rest of their transportation budget on more-specialized transportation services. Either way and unlike what standard models assume, consumers cannot just buy a small fraction of different varieties of cars for different transportation demands.====These practical issues have received formal attention in several fields, including ==== and ====. Given the prevalence of discrete trade, one may also expect careful modeling of these same issues in mainstream theories of international trade. However, on the contrary, the issue of ==== remains largely untreated in mainstream trade models.====A possible argument for this lack of attention is that discreteness plays a less critical role when studying macro-level trade patterns. But a basic analysis of product-level US trade data challenges this argument. In particular, comparing discrete industries to continuous (non-discrete) counterparts, such as “Food,” “Chemicals,” or “Textile & Apparel,” indicates that====These differences remain significant, even after we control for other characteristics like the intended final use or degree of product differentiation. At face value, the above regularities suggest that in discrete industries, trade patterns such as IQS and PTM are amplified by forces that are dormant in continuous industries. Such forces are also inevitably overlooked by mainstream theories that treat all industries or goods as continuous.====Motivated by this evidence, I develop a simple model of discrete trade that pursues two objectives. First, I use the model to elucidate how ==== may affect macro-level trade patterns (like IQS and PTM) in ways that are difficult to understand from the lens of standard trade models. Second, I use the discrete model to determine how accounting for discrete trade revises our understanding of the gains from trade—an issue that has received considerable attention in the contemporary trade literature.====My theory accommodates both continuous and discrete industries. Continuous industries are modeled in a fairly standard fashion. My modeling of discrete industries, however, is grounded in three basic assumptions. (====) Discrete goods are indivisible, wherein purchasing them involves paying a unit price that is akin to a fixed acquisition cost. (====) The consumption flow derived from a personally-acquired discrete good is increasing in its quality and can be substituted with analogous services. (====) Quality and quantity are not isomorphic: a firm cannot produce a lower quality version of their product by employing fewer inputs under the same production technology. Instead, any supply-side adjustment to output quality involves paying a fixed R&D cost.====Using the above model, I show that in ==== industries, IQS and PTM are magnified by two forces that are less relevant in ==== industries:====Both of these forces operate in a somewhat similar fashion. They lead to the ==== demand elasticity and demand for quality to diverge across rich and poor markets, even when ==== preferences are homothetic and identical across rich and poor consumers.====The role of force (====) in prompting cross-national demand differences can be explained as follows. In each national market, discrete goods compete head-to-head with services; but services are significantly more expensive in high-wage economies (i.e., the Balassa-Samuelson effect). As a result, the opportunity cost of acquiring a discrete good is lower in high-wage markets, and this is true across all income groups. These considerations give rise to two macro-level demand patterns. First, the overall demand for discrete goods is ==== price-elastic in high-wage markets. Second, there is also more demand for high-quality (high-cost) discrete varieties in these markets.====To give an example, consider a premium hair-clipper that is a discrete tradable good. In Mumbai, India, the supplier of the hair-clipper competes with $5 haircut services, whereas in Oslo, Norway, it competes with $80 haircut services.==== As a result, Indian consumers (across all income groups) will exhibit a higher degree of price sensitivity when purchasing the hair-clipper. The supplier will internalize this when setting their price or choosing their output quality for these two markets.====Contrast this with continuous goods like shampoo or hair products. Since these goods perish upon consumption, they cannot be directly substituted with services. Instead, one has to (indirectly) pay for them even if they use the barber service. The same goes for the gas used in transportation services or the food used in restaurant services. One can circumvent paying for the full price of a vehicle or a premium grill, by taking a cab or going to a restaurant. But irrespective of whether they use such services or operate their personal vehicle/grill, they have to pay for the continuous perishable input, which is food or gas in this example.====Force (====) prompts cross-national demand differences in a different way. Since discrete goods cannot be purchased in fractional quantities and come with a pre-customized quality, they can be unaffordable to low-budget consumers. Consider, for example, the Toyota Corolla which, in 2017, came with a price tag that was 8-times the annual wage rate in India. In such circumstances, ==== T==== C==== can be prohibitively expensive for a significant portion of Indian consumers—especially given that most low-income consumers do not have access to financing options (Banerjee, 2003). Correspondingly, a marginal increase in price can rule out a non-trivial measure of potential customers.====The elasticity of demand in discrete industries, therefore, depends on the hazard rate at which a price increase renders the product unaffordable to marginal, low-budget consumers. This hazard rate is itself decreasing in the discrete good's overall ====, i.e., its price relative to the wage rate in the economy.==== These considerations, once again, give rise to two macro-level demand patterns. First, the overall demand for discrete goods is ==== price-elastic in high-wage markets, where the good is on average more affordable. Second, there is more demand for high-quality (high-cost) varieties in these markets.====The cross-national demand differences triggered by Forces (====) and (====), can magnify the extent of PTM and IQS in ==== industries quite significantly. First, they prompt the suppliers of discrete goods to set higher markups in high-wage markets where their good is more affordable and also competes with expensive services. Second, the ==== and ==== local demand for quality in high-wage economies prompts high-quality specialization in these economies through scale effects.====To test the relevance of these forces, I combine data on export prices, export sales, and non-traded service prices for 147 countries across 5231 6-digit (HS6) industries in the year 2011. As in the prior literature, I document that in all industries export price levels depend systematically on market size, income per capita, and geography. In discrete industries, however, export prices increase with three additional factors that are less-relevant in continuous industries: (====) the price of non-traded services in the importing market, (====) the price of non-traded services in the exporting economy, and (====) the exporting economy's overall cost efficiency in the industry of interest. While the empirical significance of these additional factors confirms the predictions of the model, the estimated effects are also quite profound. For example, a 10% increase in the price of services in an importing market is associated with a 2.5% increase in the price of ==== imports.====On a broader level, accounting for discrete trade can revise our estimates for the gains from trade. When the traded sector is modeled as discrete rather than continuous, the predicted gains from trade are on average 28% larger but more unequally distributed across countries. These differences are driven by two factors. The first factor is somewhat mechanical: The gains from discrete trade depend on the ==== share of foreign goods in national consumption, whereas the gains from continuous trade depend on the ==== share of foreign goods in national expenditure (Arkolakis et al., 2012).====The second factor is more profound. The discrete model predicts scale-driven gains from trade that are absent in the continuous model. To elaborate, in the continuous model, the scale of national production in the traded sector is invariant to trade.==== In the discrete model, however, opening to trade induces firm-relocation from large to small and low-income economies. This type of relocation allows firms to collect a higher markup on marginal cost when selling to large and rich international markets. It also expands the scale of production in small and low-income economies at the expense of others.====Consider Canada, for instance, which is located close to the richer and larger U.S. market. From the lens of the discrete model, trade-induced scale expansion accounts for 5.6% of Canada's real GDP. Intuitively, trade openness induces firms to relocate from the U.S. to Canada, using it as a platform to export to the U.S. at a higher markup. Given the sheer size of the U.S. economy, these developments provide a sizable boost for Canada's real GDP. They also relate to the ==== effects of economic development, wherein the growth of an economy may be hindered by its small local market (Rosenstein-Rodan, 1943; Lewis, 1954; Murphy et al., 1989). But through firm-relocation, international trade can push such an economy out of this supposed growth trap.====Aside from contributing to ongoing debates about the size and nature of the gains from trade, the present paper contributes to our understanding of IQS and PTM. Existing theories of IQS and PTM often model industries as continuous.==== As a result, they naturally emphasize non-homothetic preferences and cross-national technology differences as the drivers of PTM and IQS. Prior theories of IQS and PTM that admit discrete goods (e.g., Flam and Helpman, 1987; Murphy and Shleifer, 1997; Verhoogen, 2008; Khandelwal, 2010; Fajgelbaum et al., 2011; Dingel, 2017; Auer et al., 2018), have often (====) abstracted from affordability constraints, and (====) do not include a non-traded service sector.==== As a result, from the lens of these models, discreteness in itself does not contribute to IQS or PTM. Accordingly, these models cannot explain why IQS and PTM are more pronounced in discrete industries.",Discrete trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300799,12 July 2020,2020,Research Article,155.0

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis not only provided evidence for these risks, but also raised the possibility of using macroprudential policies to reduce the size and frequency of crises associated with these forces (Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015). A large body of literature has suggested that such external risks affect EMEs by generating abrupt changes in the level and, to a lesser extent, in the volatility of interest rates at which EMEs borrow in international financial markets (Neumeyer and Perri, 2005; Uribe and Yue, 2006; Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2011). However, despite the evident risks for EMEs associated with such changes, the importance of movements in the volatility of interest rates in shaping economic activity in EMEs has not been sufficiently documented, and the implications of these risks for the design and implementation of optimal macroprudential policy have not been carefully studied.====This paper aims to fill these gaps in the literature by, first, documenting the relevance of shocks to the volatility of interest rates for economic activity in a large sample of EMEs and, second, characterizing optimal macroprudential policy in response to external risks in the form of shocks to the level and volatility of interest rates in a model of financial crises. More specifically, in the first part of this paper we conduct an empirical analysis of movements in the level and volatility of interest rates at which EMEs borrow internationally. We study how these measures evolve over time, their comovement with output, and their behavior around sudden stops for a broad sample of EMEs. We then estimate a Markov regime-switching VAR process for output and interest rates in which the volatility of interest rates varies across two regimes. In the second part of the paper we extend a Fisherian model of macroprudential policy to include external risks. The quantitative framework we consider consists of a small open economy facing an external borrowing limit that depends on the value of a domestic non-tradable asset in the spirit of Jeanne and Korinek, 2019 and Bianchi and Mendoza (2018). External risks arise from two sources: shocks to the level of interest rates, and the existence of multiple stochastic regimes in the variance of interest rates at which the economy borrows. We feed the stochastic process for output and interest rates into our model to compare its predictions with the data. We then solve for the macroprudential tax on international borrowing that implements the optimal allocations by a constrained social planner and analyze how this tax responds to shocks to the level and volatility of interest rates.====Our empirical exercise provides evidence that time variation in the level and volatility of interest rates is pervasive across time and countries. For our broad sample of EMEs, we also confirm that increases in the level and volatility of interest rates are negatively correlated with output (Neumeyer and Perri, 2005; Uribe and Yue, 2006; Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2011). Moreover, we establish that the majority of variation in interest rates, and therefore their volatility, is explained by a common factor across EMEs (Eichengreen and Mody, 1998; Longstaff et al., 2011), which can be interpreted as exogenous to countries' fundamentals. Our main empirical finding documents the anatomy of increases in the level and volatility of interest rates and of their common factor around sudden stops. We show that, during sudden stops, interest rates increase 1.7 percentage points and their volatility 0.3 percentage point and that these changes are significantly driven by movements in the exogenous common factor. Lastly, our estimation of the Markov regime-switching model confirms that there is a statistically significant difference in the volatility of interest rates across regimes. Therefore, in addition to confirming some key results in the literature on EME business cycles, we contribute to this literature with our last two findings.====In the second part of the paper we extend the model of Jeanne and Korinek, 2019 to include shocks to the level and volatility of interest rates and calibrate it to match two moments in the data: (i) the increase in interest rates around sudden stops and (ii) the prevalence of sudden stops. After feeding into the model our estimated process for output and interest rates, we derive four main results. First, while high volatility of interest rates can lead private agents and the social planner to decrease leverage because of precautionary motives, when the level of interest rates is high these motives dissipate and higher volatility leads to more borrowing. The key to understanding this result lies in the fact that high initial levels of interest rates generate enough savings to insure against volatility shocks and bonds become less of an insurance vehicle and more of a traditional asset—with a low return for high volatility—implying that agents want to hold less of it and borrow more. Second, this complex interaction of forces implies that, qualitatively, the macroprudential tax on international borrowing does not respond monotonically to changes in volatility. For instance, while for high interest rates an increase in their volatility calls for higher taxes, this result does not hold for average levels of interest rates. To better understand the forces shaping the optimal tax function, we decompose it into three factors—(i) the severity of future crises, (ii) the ability of the planner to dampen future crises, and (iii) the incidence of future crises—and show that the effects of volatility on the incidence of future crises plays a crucial role.====Third, our simulated model generates quantitatively relevant responses to shocks to the level and volatility of interest rates by agents in the competitive equilibrium and by the social planner, and these responses and the model dynamics in general replicate our data around sudden stops.====Lastly, we show that our simulations imply that, contrary to conventional wisdom, an increase in macroprudential taxes on international borrowing in response to an increase in the volatility of interest rates is seldom optimal. Furthermore, there is a 50% probability that a mean preserving spread in interest rates calls for no change in optimal taxes whatsoever.====Our theoretical results contribute to the literature on Fisherian models of macroprudential policy in multiple respects (Korinek and Mendoza, 2013). First, relative to other work that has extended these models to include new types of shocks (Bianchi et al., 2012Bianchi et al., 2016), we extend a model with asset prices to include shocks to the volatility of interest rates. Second, we provide a calibration of the simple model with asset prices of Jeanne and Korinek, 2019 that can match the data around sudden stops relatively well. Lastly, we provide a novel decomposition of the macroprudential tax into the three factors previously mentioned and show how their interaction can result in the quantitative irrelevance of interest rate volatility for macroprudential policy.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we conduct our empirical analysis and estimate the stochastic process that we feed into our theoretical framework. Section 3 introduces the model and describes the competitive equilibrium and the problem of the constrained social planner. In Section 4 we map the model to the data and present the results of our numerical exercises. We show that the dynamics of interest rates around episodes of sudden stops in the model are consistent with their empirical counterparts and explain how the optimal response of the planner is shaped by external shocks.

Judicial learning can explain litigation on the equilibrium path, since going to court today implies future payoff gains for the governments. Our model predicts that where learning is present the likelihood of both disputes and rulings should tend to decrease with court experience. Using detailed data on ","The World Trade Organization (WTO) is endowed with a sophisticated court system contained within its Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The adjudication of trade disputes is a complex task, however, and the WTO's DSB is a relatively young judicial system, having come into being on January 1 1995. In such an environment, it seems likely that a court would learn valuable lessons from its early experience, and that this learning would contribute importantly to the evolution of its performance over time.====Judged by trends in the frequency of new disputes and DSB rulings, the evolution of the performance of the WTO's court system displays some interesting patterns. Plot 1 shows the raw annual numbers of disputes initiated and DSB rulings issued over the WTO years 1995–2009.==== The plot suggests a declining trend both in the frequency of disputes and in the frequency of DSB rulings, although in a more pronounced way for disputes than for rulings. The impression from Plot 1 is that countries have engaged in fewer “fights” at the WTO as the institution has aged. If anything, Plot 1 understates this trend because the number of WTO members has increased over the last 20 years, and Plot 1 does not control for this. A simple way to control for the expanding WTO membership is to check whether country ==== fight less as they “age,” that is, the longer the pair of countries have both been WTO members. Plot 2 shows that indeed older dyads initiate fewer disputes and end up less frequently in court.====These declining trends could be interpreted in different ways. One interpretation is that they signal bad news for the WTO as an institution, in the sense that the DSB is becoming less effective – or that governments at any rate are losing confidence in it – and therefore less relevant over time.==== While this is certainly a possibility, in this paper we will propose a theory that can explain the declining trends in disputes and rulings as a result of court learning. According to our theory, these trends represent good news, not bad news. And guided by the core predictions of our theory, we show that the data on WTO dispute settlement is consistent with this interpretation.====In domestic legal settings, the importance of court learning has been widely emphasized, both by legal practitioners and by the law and economics literature. For example, an interesting informal and personal account of this importance can be found in former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens' discussion of learning on the job (Stevens, 2006). After describing how early differences of opinion and accumulated experience on the bench shaped the opinions of Justices Holmes and Brandeis in legal rulings that would determine the basis for regulatory takings under U.S. law, Justice Stevens concludes: “====.” (p. 1567).====The law and economics literature has also emphasized the importance of legal precedent and its impact on the evolution of legal rules in the context of common law systems, stimulated by Posner's (1973) claim that in the presence of precedent “common law will effect order from chaos” and generate a process that converges to efficient legal rules. One can think of the underlying process described by Posner as a “collective” form of court learning.====In the context of the WTO's DSB, such learning is no doubt also present. At the level of the Appellate Body (which is a standing body of seven judges) where an important function is to interpret and clarify the terms of the treaty “in the light of its object and purpose,” judges learn to better interpret WTO treaty provisions from their own accumulated case-load experience as well as from required exchanges over differences of opinion with each other (Zdouc, 2008, p. 271). Judges may also learn from their ruling experience to use and interpret data and to make more effective and timely use of rigorous economic reasoning in arriving at their rulings. Similar forms of court learning can occur also at the level of the lower courts' rotating Panel judges, though here the primary source of learning relies on the accumulation of arguments developed in previous DSB decisions (Zdouc, 2008, pp. 272–73). This type of court learning is therefore similar to the collective form of learning that occurs under legal precedent in domestic common-law systems and that led Posner (1973) to make his famous claim, as discussed above.==== And in the WTO there is another important standing body, namely the Secretariat, which is a group of experts that plays a supporting role in the adjudication process. To the extent that the Secretariat learns how to more effectively aid in the adjudication of WTO cases over time, this too can be thought of as part of court learning.====We refer to these possible forms of learning interchangeably as “judicial learning” or “learning by ruling,” and we describe the impacts of such learning as raising the “quality” (or “efficiency”) of the court. All these possibilities then amount to a court whose quality rises as it learns from past rulings, where court quality naturally translates into a higher expected joint payoff for governments under a court ruling. Our theory is built around this basic structure.====A key difference between a government-to-government court system like the WTO-DSB and a domestic legal setting is that the number of potential disputants in the WTO system (the member governments) is small and therefore the impact of current rulings on the future quality of the court is at least in part ==== by the potential disputants. This “large players” setting means in turn that the full implications of judicial learning for a court system such as the WTO-DSB cannot be understood in settings where the potential disputants are atomistic, as has been assumed in the law and economics literature that studies court learning in the domestic legal context. Moreover, the internalization of court learning may have implications not only for the decision of whether to go to court, but also for the choices that determine whether there is a dispute in the first place. The law and economics literature does not speak to this issue, because that literature typically treats the dispute margin as exogenous. In contrast, we explore the implications of judicial learning through a simple dynamic model that endogenizes the occurrence of both disputes and rulings in a large-players setting.====The main ingredients of our model are as follows. In each period, a Home government makes a policy choice and a Foreign government decides whether or not to dispute this choice. If a dispute is initiated, governments bargain “in the shadow of the law,” subject to negotiation costs. In case of disagreement, the court intervenes and issues a ruling with the objective of maximizing the governments' joint payoff. Finally, the quality of court rulings increases with experience (cumulative rulings), implying a higher joint disagreement payoff for the governments.====Our first main result is that the presence of judicial learning can give rise to litigation in equilibrium. In most existing models of “bargaining in the shadow of the law,” litigation is explained by informational frictions, either in the form of private information or of inconsistent prior beliefs about the court ruling. Our model, by contrast, generates equilibrium court intervention for a different reason: due to learning by ruling, going to court today may imply payoff gains for the governments tomorrow. Importantly, such payoff gains arise even if governments do not go to court tomorrow, because court learning improves the disagreement point for tomorrow's bargain (an off-equilibrium effect), and arise even if governments do not have a dispute tomorrow, because court learning improves the policy that Home chooses to avoid a dispute (an “off-off-equilibrium” effect).====To demonstrate how the prospect of judicial learning can give rise to litigation, we begin with a static benchmark setting, and show that in such a setting disputes never go to court in equilibrium. In spite of the lack of rulings, however, the governments' joint payoff increases with court quality, due to the off- and off-off-equilibrium effects described above. Notably, this joint payoff increase is assured even though we find that, if court efficiency is above a threshold level, further increases in court efficiency must hurt one government and benefit the other. We also find that, while they will never go to court, disputes ==== occur in equilibrium in the static setting, and the likelihood of disputes tends to be higher if the court is less efficient. With these results established in the benchmark static setting, we then turn to a dynamic setting and show that the presence of court learning can give rise to rulings in equilibrium. Furthermore, the probability of rulings is higher – other things equal – if governments are more patient.====Our second main result is to show that, when judicial learning is the driving force of equilibrium disputes and rulings, the likelihood of current disputes and rulings must decrease with court experience (cumulative rulings) if governments are sufficiently patient; and even if the governments' patience is low, the likelihood of disputes and rulings decreases with court experience in an average sense. The role played by government patience is due to the fact that an increase in court experience has both a “dynamic effect” and a “static effect” that push in opposite directions. Focusing on the case of rulings, the dynamic effect of an increase in court experience makes a ruling less likely as long as the future joint returns from court learning are diminishing, but the static effect pushes in the opposite direction because an increase in DSB quality reduces the inefficiency of going to court today. As we demonstrate, the static effect can overwhelm the dynamic effect for specific levels of court experience if governments are not very patient, but on average the dynamic effect must dominate. And regarding whether the future joint returns from court learning are diminishing, our model highlights two forces that push in this direction. One is not surprising, and arises if learning itself occurs at a diminishing rate. But even if learning occurs at a constant rate, returns from court learning may still be diminishing, and the reason is linked to the off-off-equilibrium effect of court quality that we mentioned above: conditional on a dispute ==== being initiated, an increase in court quality induces the Home government to select a more efficient policy, and the associated efficiency gain is diminishing due to the concavity of the Pareto frontier.====These results therefore suggest that a declining frequency of disputes and rulings over time can be a symptom of the beneficial learning that is associated with a rise in cumulative rulings, and hence good news for the WTO. But we also show that the ==== (likelihood of settlement conditional on a dispute) may go up or down with cumulative rulings even if governments are patient. Hence, when viewed through the lens of our model, one should look at the impact of cumulative rulings on the unconditional likelihood of rulings and disputes, not the settlement rate, when seeking evidence of court learning. This finding helps guide our empirical analysis.====Our basic model focuses on two countries, and therefore cannot make a distinction between disputant-specific learning (applying only to future disputes that involve the same disputants) and general-scope learning (applying to future disputes regardless of which countries are involved). But with many countries, learning could be disputant-specific, or purely general, or in-between these two extremes. We consider these possibilities in a many-country extension of our model, with the aim of making our framework more flexible in anticipation of our empirical analysis. We show in this extended setting that our main results continue to hold, but now the pattern of the impacts of court experience on the likelihood of current disputes and rulings is also informative about the ==== of court learning.====Finally, we look for evidence of learning by ruling using WTO trade dispute data. Unlike the existing empirical work on learning by doing for firms, where direct measures of productivity are available (see, for example, Irwin and Klenow, 1994, Clerides et al., 1998, Bernard and Bradford Jensen, 1999, Benkard, 2000, Thornton and Thompson, 2001, Kellogg, 2011 and Levitt et al., 2013), we cannot observe directly the quality of the court, so we cannot estimate directly the relationship between court experience and court quality; but we can use the predictions of our model to indirectly gauge the importance of learning by ruling. We focus on the key prediction of our model regarding the likelihood of rulings, because data on rulings are more reliable than data on disputes. Our model suggests that a stronger (negative) effect of cumulative rulings on the likelihood of current rulings signals the presence of stronger court learning. Furthermore, our model suggests a way to gauge empirically the scope of court learning. In a world with many countries and many issue areas, the scope of court learning might be general, or specific to the disputant countries, or specific to the disputed issue area. By exploring how the likelihood of current rulings is affected by different measures of court experience, e.g. disputant-specific, issue–area-specific, or general-scope experience, we attempt to gauge the relevant domains of court learning, following a similar empirical approach to Kellogg (2011) who looks for evidence of various forms of learning by doing in the context of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry.====Our empirical findings suggest that judicial learning in the WTO is significant. We find evidence consistent with issue–area- and disputant-specific learning, while we find only weak evidence of general-scope learning. Moreover, we find that calendar time does not have a negative impact on the frequency of rulings once we control for our measures of court experience, suggesting that court learning can help explain the raw declining trends in disputes and rulings as evidenced by Plots 1 and 2 and provide a “good news” interpretation of these trends. We also discuss alternative explanations for the correlations we find in the data.====To our knowledge this is the first paper that explores the implications of judicial learning for trade disputes, or more generally for international institutions. A related model is Maggi and Staiger (2011), but that paper does not consider learning and does not allow for bargaining or settlement, and focuses on questions of institutional design, while here we focus on how learning affects the initiation and outcome of trade disputes. In Maggi and Staiger (2015) we do allow governments to settle or fight it out in court, but the model is static, and focuses on how the outcome of trade disputes is affected by the form of the contract (property vs liability rules). Other models that generate trade disputes in equilibrium are Park (2011), Beshkar (2016) and Staiger and Sykes (2017), but these papers do not focus on the determinants of dispute outcomes (with the partial exception of Beshkar). Our model is also related to the law-and-economics literature on bargaining in the shadow of the law (e.g. Bebchuck, 1984; Reinganum and Wilde, 1986); these models however are typically static, do not focus on court learning, and are not concerned with international institutions.====By contrast, there is a vast law-and-economics literature on the implications of legal precedent for the evolution of common law, as we have noted. But its emphasis on whether a system of common-law precedent can deliver efficient law under conditions that typify domestic legal settings makes the focus of this literature very different. Among other things, the difference in emphasis accounts for the fact that this literature treats the potential disputants as atomistic, and therefore it is not directly relevant for the large-players setting of WTO disputes.====On the empirical side, there are papers that examine various determinants of the initiation and outcome of trade disputes, including Busch (2000), Busch and Reinhardt, 2000, Busch and Reinhardt, 2006, Guzman and Simmons, 2002, Guzman and Simmons, 2005, Bown (2005), Davis and Bermeo (2009), Bown and Reynolds (2015), Conconi et al. (2017), Kuenzel (2017) and Maggi and Staiger (2018). But none of these papers are concerned with the dynamics of court learning.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our benchmark static model. Section 3 develops our dynamic model with learning by ruling. Section 4 develops a multi-country version of our model which allows for various forms of learning spillovers. Section 5 examines the empirical content of our theory through WTO dispute data. Section 6 offers concluding remarks. Finally, an Appendix contains several proofs not included in the body of the paper and presents a simple parametrized model that illustrates how the reduced-form assumptions we make in the main model can be “micro founded.”",Learning by ruling and trade disputes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300672,10 July 2020,2020,Research Article,157.0

This question has received a lot of attention in recent years given the discord between the international nature of the global financial system and its regulation and supervision by national jurisdictions. An attempt to answer this question confronts two key challenges. The first challenge is to establish a causal link between a regulatory action and bank behaviour since both may be driven by confounding factors such as simultaneity and reverse causation.==== The second challenge is to identify the effect of changes in bank behaviour on economic activity.====I address these challenges by using micro-data to study the spillover of a specific macroprudential regulation in Spain to Mexico via the Mexican subsidiaries of Spanish banks. I find that the Spanish regulation, even though unrelated to credit conditions in Mexico, caused a contraction in household credit supplied by the subsidiaries of Spanish banks in Mexico. Mexican municipalities with a larger exposure to the subsidiaries experienced a larger contraction in household credit supply. Therefore, the variation in exposure to this contraction across Mexican municipalities provides a quasi-experiment to study the effect of drops in household credit supply on macroeconomic activity.====I use the variation across Mexican municipalities to show that localized contractions in household credit supply resulting from the Spanish regulation caused a contraction in loan volumes issued to the local non-tradable sector. Given the lack of direct data on sector-level investment and production, the localized drops in lending to the non-tradable sector are interpreted as a contraction in macroeconomic activity in the non-tradable sector of Mexican municipalities more exposed to Spanish banks.==== This unique combination of the ==== (a macroprudential regulation) and the ==== (lending to households) of the spillover has allowed me to study the macroeconomic effects of shocks in lending to households in an emerging economy.====The Spanish regulation was introduced in two waves in early 2012 by the Government of Spain to alleviate uncertainty surrounding the quality of the balance sheet of Spanish banks. This regulation imposed significant loan-loss provisions on Spanish real-estate assets held by Spanish banks as of December 2011.==== The provision requirements of the regulation met near universal compliance by June 2012. BBVA and Santander—the two largest Spanish banking groups—reported additional provisions of 4.4 billion and 6.1 billion euros in response to the regulation, respectively.==== Neither bank raised additional equity to cover the provision requirements given the elevated cost of equity during this period.====The effect of the Spanish regulation on the BBVA and Santander banking groups spilled over to the operations of their fully-owned subsidiaries in Mexico. Together, these subsidiaries accounted for 48% of mortgages and 44% of consumer credit issued by commercial banks in Mexico in June 2012. I find that these subsidiaries sharply increased their dividends (in absolute terms and as a share of their net operating income) in 2012. Coincident with this increase, the subsidiaries contracted lending to Mexican households in the immediate aftermath of the regulation.====Fig. 1 shows growth rates for commercial credit issued by Spanish and non-Spanish banks in Mexico during 2010–2013. There is a clear difference in the growth rate of consumer and housing credit issued by Spanish and non-Spanish banks after June 2012. I exploit the variation in this shock to household credit supply across Mexican municipalities as a quasi-experiment. I use a difference-in-differences specification to show that municipalities with greater exposure to Spanish banks experienced larger declines in the growth rate of household credit. Exposure to Spanish banks is measured by the share of Spanish banks in the household credit market (Spanish share) in June 2011, a year before the introduction of the regulation. I find that municipalities with a 10% higher pre-shock share of Spanish banks in the household credit market experienced a 2.3% higher drop in the growth rate of household credit after the introduction of the regulation during December 2012 to December 2013. I control for municipality characteristics using municipality fixed effects and observed municipality characteristics interacted with a ==== dummy in the baseline specification. In addition, I estimate a lower bound to the reported coefficient taking into account omitted variable bias using the technique suggested by Altonji et al. (2005) and Oster (2017). These checks show the reported coefficient to be very robust.====The reliance on an international source allows for a clean identification of the shock to household credit supply. This is because identification in this paper is based on two key factors—relevant aspects of the Spanish regulation were unexpected and second, unrelated to macroeconomic conditions in Mexico. Based on these factors, I argue that the contractions in lending to households at a municipality level are unlikely to be the result of expectations (as in Adelino et al. (2016)) or household demand (as in Gropp et al. (2014)). I provide evidence against these alternative hypotheses using lending data disaggregated at a bank-municipality level. The main benefits of using this additional data dimension are that it allows me to control for demand in a given municipality using municipality-time fixed effects and to show that the localized contractions in lending to households were specifically seen in lending from Spanish banks. This rules out alternate channels related to credit demand (such as a spillover of the crisis in Spain to Mexican municipalities more exposed to Spanish banks) since lower credit demand would lead to lending contraction by both Spanish and non-Spanish banks.====I use the shock to household credit supply to study the impact of localized contractions in household credit on macroeconomic activity in different economic sectors at a municipality level. As has been shown in studies by Mian and Sufi (2014), Di Maggio and Kermani (2017) and Mondragon (2018), changes in credit supply to households can lower aggregate demand and thereby affect economic activity in the non-tradable sector of the economy.==== I test whether the supply shock to household credit in Mexican municipalities also affected economic activity in any particular economic sector. In order to do so, I merge the data on lending to households with data on lending to 4-digit NAICS industrial sectors (279 in total) at a municipality level. I use credit at an industrial/sectoral level as a proxy for economic activity in that particular industry/sector. Credit issued by commercial banks to firms in Mexico is largely in the form of working capital (see Table 1(c)) and therefore a suitable proxy for economic activity.====As per the classification criteria in Mian and Sufi (2014) and Mondragon (2018), I treat industries in the retail and restaurant sectors as non-tradable at a municipality level.==== Mexican municipalities which experienced a larger contraction in lending to households also experienced a contraction in lending to the non-tradable sector.====As was done in the case of lending to households, lending data disaggregated at a bank-municipality level shows that localized contractions in lending to the non-tradable sector in high Spanish share municipalities was driven by comparable contractions from both Spanish and non-Spanish banks.==== This suggests that the contraction in lending to the non-tradable sector was not driven by a credit supply shock from Spanish banks. Consistent with the idea that contraction in lending to the non-tradable sector represents a drop in credit demand, I document a drop in the average interest rate of marginal, or newly issued, loans to firms in the non-tradable sector in high exposure municipalities. If the contraction was the result of a credit supply shock from Spanish banks, we would expect the average interest of marginal loans to increase.====On the strength of these results, I use ==== interacted with Spanish share as an instrument to measure municipality-level exogenous shocks to household credit supply resulting from the Spanish regulation. Based on this IV setup, the estimated elasticity of credit demand by the non-tradable sector to changes in household credit supply ranges from 1.2–1.8. The reported elasticity is highly robust. The elasticity estimated using an alternative Bartik-type shift-share instrument is remarkably close to that estimated using raw shares. The coefficient capturing the contraction in lending to the non-tradable sector is robust to WLS and the exclusion of small municipalities from the sample.====I have shown that the contraction in lending to the non-tradable sector, as measured on the treatment variable, is not driven by a credit supply shock from Spanish banks. However, did the Spanish regulation lead to a credit supply shock on lending to Mexican firms in general? Exposure to Spanish banks in the corporate credit market does not explain any municipality level changes in total corporate credit after the introduction of the Spanish regulation. This also holds true for municipality level credit to the tradable and the non-tradable sector. This null result is complemented by evidence from loan-level data from the Mexican credit registry for firms. Results based on a regression specification akin to Khwaja and Mian (2008) show that there was no change in the contractual terms of marginal loans offered by Spanish banks vis-à-vis those offered by non-Spanish banks during this period.====Thus while contributions such as Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004), Faulkender and Petersen (2006) and Jiménez et al. (2017) have focused on the impact of capital requirements on lending to firms, the results of my paper suggest that spillovers from macroprudential regulations may have asymmetric effects on lending to firms and households by affected banks.==== I posit two plausible hypotheses (differences in capital requirements and relationship distance between banks and different sectors of the loan portfolio) in Section 4.6 which may account for the null results on lending to firms. However, I lack access to loan-level data on lending to households in Mexico necessary to conclusively establish the existence of or test any hypothesis explaining such asymmetric effects.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the macroprudential regulation introduced by the Spanish Government in 2012. Section 3 describes the data and the empirical methodology used to measure the supply shock to household credit and the subsequent effect on the macroeconomy of Mexican municipalities.

Wang Zi,"College of Business, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China","Received 1 January 2018, Revised 1 June 2020, Accepted 10 June 2020, Available online 20 June 2020, Version of Record 17 July 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2020.103353,Cited by (8),I study the welfare implications of ,"In the era of globalization, corporate income tax is no longer solely a domestic policy since (i) multinational enterprises (MNEs) account for a large fraction of global production and (ii) corporate taxes have been shown to be influential for the spatial allocation of MNEs' activities.==== International corporate tax competition and cooperation have drawn increasing attention from researchers and policy makers.==== In the presence of multinational production (MP), what are the welfare and distributional implications of corporate taxes? What would occur if international tax treaties were abandoned? What would be the outcome if countries engaged in tax cooperation? These questions are key for understanding international corporate tax policies. However, there is currently a lack of tractable models that connect theoretical answers to these questions to data, a gap that this paper aims to fill.====In this paper, I quantify the aggregate effects of corporate taxes in the presence of MP and analyze noncooperative and cooperative corporate tax policies. To achieve these, I develop a quantifiable multi-country general equilibrium model that incorporates trade, MP, and salient features of the international corporate tax system. In the model, firms decide their production locations based on each country's corporate tax rates, wages, size, productivity, and trade and MP barriers to other countries. I use bilateral MP sales across 28 countries and their corporate tax rates to estimate the model's key parameters. Armed with the estimated model, I compute in multi-country general equilibrium the effects of the recent corporate tax reform in the U.S. and the potential tax reform in the U.K. after Brexit. I also compute Nash and cooperative corporate tax rates to shed light on the causes and consequences of international corporate tax competition and cooperation.====My model builds on the quantitative trade and MP model developed by Arkolakis et al. (henceforth ARRY, Arkolakis et al., 2018). In the model, firms can geographically separate their creation of differentiated goods (“innovation”) from production, allowing some countries to specialize in innovation and others to specialize in production. As in ARRY (2018), specialization in innovation or production depends on comparative advantage as well as geography. My model extends the ARRY model in two dimensions. First, I allow a country to levy corporate taxes on firms that produce there.==== In particular, I allow each ==== country to impose different corporate tax rates on firms originated from different ==== countries. In practice, the host country levies a local corporate tax on all firms producing there, and source-country-specific ==== on foreign multinational affiliates.==== Second, I allow firms to shift part of their profits to low tax countries. This extension captures the MNEs' tax avoidance and the differences between statutory and effective corporate tax rates due to profit shifting. With many countries, international corporate taxation, and profit shifting, the model still yields closed-form gravity equations of bilateral trade and MP flows. Based on these structural equations, I estimate model parameters and conduct counterfactual analysis.====I rely on special cases of my model to characterize analytically a country's incentive to manipulate its corporate taxes. The key mechanism in my analysis is the home market effect in innovation. Other things equal, firms tend to create differentiated goods (“innovate”) in a country that has low barriers to outward MP but high barriers to inward MP. Imposing higher corporate tax rates on foreign firms than on domestic firms, a country effectively increases its inward MP cost, inducing firm entry and boosting innovation.==== Since innovation is an increasing-returns-to-scale activity, countries gain from this home market effect in innovation. In the special case with two symmetric countries, I show that the unilaterally optimal tax rate on foreign firms is higher than that on domestic firms. In reality, we do not often observe such huge tax gaps between foreign and domestic firms. However, if we take all subsidies targeted to domestic firms into account, the optimal taxes in this paper would indeed be relevant to policy practices in many countries.====The parameters that govern how firms relocate their plants in response to changes in corporate taxes are key for my quantification. The model generates a structural equation that expresses bilateral MP flows as a function of bilateral corporate tax rates, frictions to MP, and source- and host-country-specific factors. Using data on MP sales and corporate taxes in 28 countries, I estimate the impact of bilateral corporate tax rates on bilateral MP sales, which yields an elasticity of MP entry with respect to corporate tax rates of 7.69. This estimate is in line with the elasticity of MP entry with respect to MP costs that has been estimated in ARRY (2018) using alternative strategies.====The model is then calibrated to match data on bilateral trade and MP flows across 28 countries and the profits shifted by the U.S. MNEs documented in Bruner et al. (2018). I use the calibrated model to quantify the impacts of two corporate tax reforms. First, the United States reduced its local corporate tax rate by 13 percentage points in 2017. My quantitative analysis suggests that this tax cut increases the real income in the U.S. by about 1% but decreases the average real income of other countries by 0.075%. Moreover, the U.S. innovation workers gain more from this tax cut than the U.S. production workers. Second, I consider the potential corporate tax reform in the United Kingdom after Brexit. Motivated by Brexit, I increase trade and MP costs between the U.K. and the EU countries by 5%. This will reduce the real income in the U.K. by 1.7%. However, if the U.K. reduces its corporate tax rate by 12 percentage points, then its welfare loss from Brexit will shrink to 1.2%. In other words, the U.K. tax cut could compensate about one third of the welfare loss led by Brexit.====I then investigate non-cooperative corporate taxes across countries, starting by considering ==== corporate taxes, i.e., the corporate taxes countries would impose if they do not fear any retaliation. Consistent with the analytical results, each country can gain considerably at the expense of other countries by imposing higher corporate tax rates on foreign firms than on domestic firms. The average optimal corporate tax rate on domestic firms is −2.47%, whereas the average optimal corporate tax rate on foreign MNEs (local corporate tax + NRDW tax) is 33.5%. Although we do not observe negative corporate taxes in reality, this result can be justified by industrial subsidies that target on domestic firms. Comparing to the factual equilibrium, these taxes lead to the average 1.6% welfare gain in the tax-imposing country and the average −0.05% welfare loss in other countries.====I turn to analyze ==== corporate taxes among eight major countries in MP activities.==== The average Nash corporate tax rates are −1.56% on domestic firms and 38.7% on foreign firms. Tax competition distorts tax structure in participation countries, reducing MP and resulting in welfare losses: five out of eight countries incur welfare losses relative to the factual equilibrium, whereas all eight countries incur welfare losses relative to the tax-free equilibrium. Interestingly, in the absence of profit shifting, tax competition would lead to much larger welfare losses for participation countries. This is because the effective Nash corporate tax rates on foreign firms would be higher if these firms cannot shift their profits to low tax countries.====Finally, I investigate ==== corporate taxes across eight countries involved in tax competition, i.e., the taxes these countries would impose under efficient tax negotiation. The results show that tax cooperation decreases corporate tax rates dramatically in all participation countries, triggering firm entry and benefiting everyone. Tax negotiation starting from factual taxes increases the real income in each participation country by 0.98%. Notably, the factual corporate taxes on foreign firms are much closer to ==== taxes than to ==== taxes, which highlights the effectiveness of international tax treaties that coordinate corporate taxation across borders.====To the best of my knowledge, this is the first quantitative analysis of corporate taxation in a multi-country environment with MP. Theoretical studies, including but not limited to Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986), Wilson (1986), Kanbur and Keen (1993), Gordon and MacKie-Mason, 1995, Gordon and Hines (2002), Johannesen, 2016, Devereux (2014), and Devereux, 2008, analyze welfare implications of corporate taxes for both tax-imposing countries and other countries. These models illustrate the ==== effects of international tax competition on MP and welfare, but work with a small open economy or two countries. Hence, it is difficult to bring those models to data and assess their ==== importance. This paper incorporates corporate taxation into a multi-country general equilibrium model with trade and MP and quantify its welfare implications.====My model builds on the quantitative MP model developed by ARRY (2018). A nice feature of their model is that they allow export-platform FDI but still obtain analytical gravity equations for aggregate trade and MP flows. However, ARRY (2018), together with other quantitative MP models such as Ramondo and Rodriguez-Clare (2013), Tintelnot (2017), and Irarrazabal et al. (2013), focus on the welfare effects of MP without considering corporate tax policies. I extend ARRY (2018) by introducing the international corporate tax system summarized by Huizinga and Voget (2009) and the MNEs' profit shifting documented in Bruner et al. (2018).====My work is also inspired by the international commercial policy literature in the spirit of Bagwell and Staiger (1999). In particular, I calculate optimal taxes, Nash taxes, and cooperative taxes just like trade policy researchers calculate optimal tariffs, Nash tariffs, and cooperative tariffs. The quantitative techniques I use here to compute Nash and cooperative taxes draw from the quantitative techniques in Ossa (2014) that are used to study tariff wars and tariff talks. Ossa (2016) also uses similar techniques to analyze subsidy competition among the U.S. states. My work is the first attempt in applying this technique to assess international corporate taxation. Nash taxes and cooperative taxes are both extremes that are useful to understanding international tax conflicts and treaties in reality.====The structural estimation in this paper is related to empirical studies on the effects of corporate taxes on the spatial allocation of MNEs' activities. Barrios et al. (2009) show that host and parent country corporate taxes have a negative impact on the location of new foreign subsidiaries. Huizinga and Voget (2009) apply the gravity model to estimate the impact of international double taxation on bilateral numbers of merger and acquisition. Huizinga et al. (2014) find that international double taxation of foreign-source bank income reduces banking-sector FDI. My empirical estimates are consistent with their findings and are used as an input for my quantitative analysis.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework describing the economic environment and the equilibrium given corporate tax rates. Section 3 characterizes the welfare implications of corporate taxes in special cases. In section 4, I structurally estimate the model's key parameters and calibrate the model to data on 28 countries. Section 5 quantifies the aggregate effects of corporate tax reforms in reality. Section 6 investigates the consequences of potential tax wars and tax talks among eight major countries in MP activities.

I embed portfolio choice in a multi-country, multi-sector model in order to explore how sectoral productivity differences affect a country's risk exposure and hence influence home bias. The model predicts that investors from highly specialized economies who want to hedge their risk have a strong incentive to avoid domestic assets. I confirm the prediction with the data by finding that home bias is negatively correlated with a country's degree of industrial specialization. This finding unveils the interaction between intranational risk hedging across sectors and international risk hedging across countries.","International finance models typically show that investors can reap substantial benefits from international portfolio diversification. Yet the data indicate that domestic equity accounts for a predominant share of investors' portfolios, despite the current integration of the world capital market. The phenomenon of “equity home bias,” documented by French and Poterba (1991) and Tesar and Werner (1995), continues to be a perplexing puzzle in international economics.====Various attempts have been made to examine home bias. Besides informational and institutional frictions that prohibit capital flows, investors' desire to hedge their risk has been proposed as an explanation for why it is optimal to deviate from portfolio diversification.==== However, most of these studies abstract from industrial structure and as a consequence ignore productivity differences across sectors. In this paper I contend that heterogeneity in sectoral productivity significantly influences the pattern of risk hedging by investors and their portfolio choices. I identify and explain the novel fact that home bias is stronger in countries with more diversified industrial structures.====In order to better understand why industrial specialization may drive the variation in home bias across countries, I build a model in a multi-country, multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) setting. The model embeds Eaton and Kortum (2002)’s framework to capture the effect of productivity on sectoral size and trade volumes, which in turn influence a country's risk exposure. To obtain an analytical solution to the portfolio choice problem in the baseline two-country, two-sector model, I follow the approach developed by Coeurdacier (2009), who derives investors' optimal asset holdings by analyzing the covariances between asset returns and macroeconomic variables. In solving for equity holdings in an extended quantitative framework, I employ the method of Devereux and Sutherland (2011), who use a higher degree of approximation of investors' objective function to capture portfolio behavior.====The solution to the model enriches our understanding of investors' risk-hedging pattern and hence their portfolio choices. In this multi-sectoral setting, investors are able to hedge their risk not only by holding assets in different countries (inter-country risk hedging) but also by holding domestic assets in different sectors (intra-country risk hedging). If the covariance across domestic assets ensures efficient risk hedging, there is less need for investors to hold foreign equities. Thus there is an interesting interaction between the choice of sectors and the choice of countries.====The interaction predicts that industrial specialization has a negative effect on home bias. More industrially-diversified countries exhibit higher degrees of intranational risk hedging such that sectoral shocks in an individual industry do not affect the whole economy in a substantial way. In contrast, highly specialized countries incur greater risks because they have few productive sectors. In those countries there is limited intranational risk hedging since, once the key industries are in peril, other domestic sectors cannot work as a buffer in the economy. Thus, to hedge their risk, investors hold fewer domestic assets and rely more heavily on international risk hedging by holding foreign assets.====To account for intra- versus inter-national risk hedging patterns, I empirically test the relationship between equity home bias and countries' industrial specialization proxied by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). The home bias index I construct uses proprietary financial datasets including Factset/Lionshare and Datastream, while HHI uses the UNIDO sectoral data. After constructing the two indices, I document a robust negative correlation between them: when institutional features and country sizes are controlled for, a 1 standard deviation increase in HHI is associated with a 0.25 standard deviation decrease in home bias.====In the numerical part of this paper, I extend the baseline model to a quantitative framework that covers a large set of countries and industries. I estimate sectoral productivity and trade cost consistent with the model and trade data. After that, I solve for investors' portfolio choices given the industrial structure. The model performs well in predicting trade volumes and factor prices. Furthermore, it replicates the negative correlation between home bias and industrial specialization observed in the data. After evaluating model performance, I simulate a counterfactual scenario absent sectoral productivity differences and find the resulting home bias to be notably higher than in the original case. This result, reflecting the benefit of intranational risk hedging arising from industrial diversification, reinforces the importance of incorporating rich industrial structures in studying equity home bias.====This paper extends the literature that relates investors' risk-hedging motives to equity home bias by adding the sectoral productivity dimension. Coeurdacier and Rey (2013) provide a comprehensive survey of the literature. Baxter and Jermann (1997) argue that home bias is more puzzling when labor income risk — due to the positive correlation between domestic labor and capital income — is taken into account. Cole and Obstfeld (1991), Coeurdacier (2009), and Kollmann (2006) introduce real exchange rate risk by including one tradable good from each country. Unlike previous work, my model allows for multiple sectors of production within countries and intra-sectoral trade across countries. Investors not only choose assets based on the country of issue but also the sector, and thus have more ways to hedge against the two risks. My model is also a more general case of Tesar (1993) and Collard et al. (2007), who have one tradable and one nontradable sector in each country. I impose high trade costs on certain sectors to capture their nontradability in the quantitative framework. Moreover, this paper is related to the work of Heathcote and Perri (2013) and Steinberg (2017), who link portfolio diversification to trade openness. Unlike their models with taste preference as the main driver of trade, I provide more micro-foundations using a Ricardian multi-sectoral framework. This approach is in line with recent research that examines the macroeconomic implications of trade structure, such as Eaton et al. (2016).====The analysis in this paper also complements the literature on the interaction of risk sharing and industrial specialization. This strand of literature can be traced back to Helpman and Razin (1978), who argue that the increased benefits of specialization can be achieved by trade in assets to insure against production risk. More recently, Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2003) and Koren (2003) find empirical support for the positive impact of financial integration on trade specialization. Here I focus on the influence of industrial structure on asset positions by studying how trade specialization affects portfolio diversification. All of these works, which examine the interplay between international goods and capital flows, are particularly important for understanding the patterns of globalization.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes and solves the baseline model.

An empirical VAR estimation shows that a news shock has a larger contemporaneous impact on sovereign credit spreads than a comparable shock to labor productivity. A quantitative model of news and sovereign debt default with endogenous maturity choice generates impulse responses and a variance decomposition similar to the empirical VAR estimates. The dynamics of the economy after a bad news shock share some features of a productivity shock and some features of sudden stop events. However, unlike during sudden stop episodes, long-term debt does not shield the country from bad news shocks, and it may even exacerbate default risk. Finally, an increase in the precision of news allows the government to improve its debt maturity management, especially during periods of high stress in credit markets, and thus face lower yield spreads while increasing the amount of debt.","Several financial crises in emerging and advanced economies have highlighted how shifts in expectations about the future path of the economy affect sovereign debt decisions and prices, reinforcing the view that news about future fundamentals are a relevant driving force in international credit markets. Our paper analyzes the extent to which changes in expectations driven by news matter for sovereign credit risk dynamics, and how the effect depends on the maturity of sovereign debt.====The role of news about future productivity for sovereign credit events is illustrated in Fig. 1. The plots in the figure show the evolution of labor productivity and country risk around sovereign financial distress episodes.==== The sample contains 20 years of data for 12 emerging economies. The analysis focuses on episodes involving significantly high country risk. We define a debt crisis, or high country risk event, as a period in which the EMBI+ doubles relative to the previous year. The main takeaway from the figure is that country risk reacts ==== any sharp reduction in productivity, suggesting that bond prices may be responding to news about ==== productivity.====We complement the suggestive evidence offered by the figure with a more formal empirical analysis, estimating a panel-VAR that follows the identification strategy of news shocks introduced by Beaudry and Portier (2006). Our results show that news shocks have a significant contemporaneous effect on country risk, and that such effect is larger than that of a labor productivity shock of similar magnitude.====The empirical VAR results provide us a motivating starting point to study the role of news for sovereign debt dynamics, and we advance our analysis further by developing a structural model with news, debt maturity choice, and default risk.====Our contributions can be framed in terms of the answers to three questions: First, we consider different sources of macroeconomic fluctuations in small open economies, so every period our model economy receives shocks to productivity, credit markets access (sudden stop), and a noisy signal about next period productivity (news shock). Thus, a natural question that arises in this context is: ==== The economic dynamics after a bad news shock share some features of a response to a productivity shock and other features of a response to a sudden stop event. In particular, after the realization of bad news, the country experiences an immediate jump in the default probability as in the case of a bad productivity shock, though significantly smaller. The reason for the smaller response of the default probability is that the anticipation of averse future fundamentals allows the country to reduce its liabilities ahead of the decline in productivity. This deleveraging is nevertheless smaller than the one that typically follows a sudden stop episode, so the default probability remains elevated long after the bad news shock occurs. Thus, an important first contribution of our study is that it helps understand how different key sources of macro fluctuations affect sovereign debt and default risk dynamics in small open economies.====To moderate the impact of shocks on the economy, sovereigns manage their sovereign liabilities. The debt management process involves not only decisions about the total amount of debt but also, crucially, about when the debt is due. Then, our second question is: ==== Our study is the first to analyze news shocks in a sovereign default model with long-term bonds, so it is well equipped to address the question. Intuitively, as bad news increase the cost of borrowing, countries limit their debt issuance after a bad news shock. Accordingly, after receiving bad news, countries reduce their debt in the amount of payments due that period. As the due payments are smaller the longer the maturity, there is less default in the period of a bad news shock when the country has longer debt maturity. While this intuitive line of thought suggests that long maturity shields countries from bad news shocks, such conclusion would be misleading because the reduced deleveraging in the period of the shock implies that there is higher default in the period after the news shock. In fact, we find that long debt maturity implies a larger default probability in the following years, which yields a higher cumulative default probability.====The answers to our first two key questions indicate that debt maturity choice is a very relevant dimension of a country's response to news shocks. The main advantages of an endogenous maturity approach over a fixed-maturity setup for the purpose of our study can be summarized as follows: First, our analysis focuses in part on comparing the macro dynamics following news shocks to those following sudden stops. As sudden stop episodes are periods during which the country cannot issue new debt, to best capture these episodes we need a model in which maturity can change over time. In our setup, during a sudden stop, the country is faced with the choice of defaulting or making payments. If the country decides to make the payments, maturity naturally decreases by one period per year. To keep maturity fixed, the country must issue bonds every period, which by definition is not possible during a sudden stop. Thus, to implement a sudden stop as a period during which the country cannot issue new external debt, the model should accommodate maturity changes. Second, after calibrating the model with endogenous maturity, one can obtain the maturity in the stationary distribution and fix it at that level. With that fixed maturity, most moments are similar to the model with endogenous maturity. However, without solving the model with endogenous maturity, we do not know what maturity we should set given the calibration (for more details, see the Appendix and the references therein to the Online Appendix). Also, as shown in Sánchez et al. (2018), models with exogenous maturity often fix it at a level that is much higher than what the government would choose given the calibrated shocks in the economy, and more broadly, the economic environment. In particular, higher risk aversion and sudden stop shocks are necessary to sustain long maturity as an equilibrium choice. Moreover, several key moments would be different at alternative fixed maturities, suggesting that the level we impose as the fixed maturity would affect the calibrated parameters targeting these moments. Third, having endogenous maturity enables us to exploit the variation in the maturity dimension in the model, for instance comparing default probabilities across maturities, or comparing economies with different equilibrium maturities (there must be a reason for the difference in maturities, it cannot just be imposed) by varying the probability of a sudden stop shock. Fourth, we can compare the cyclicality of debt maturity in the model and the data. In our model with endogenous long-term debt, higher productivity decreases the cost of long-term borrowing due to a lower future default probability, despite the effects of debt dilution. As in the quantitative default literature, the cost of default in the model is more severe with higher productivity, reducing even more the default probabilities in those states, which makes long term debt less costly, and hence increases its correlation with output.====After analyzing the role of debt maturity when assessing a country's response to news, we use the model to understand the role of a key property of news. Specifically, our third main question can be formulated as follows: ==== In the benchmark calibration, the precision of news is calibrated such that the model replicates the dynamics of labor productivity after a news shock as estimated in the data. We then vary the precision of news and analyze key changes in the long run statistics of the economy and on the dynamics after a news shock. We find that as news precision increases, the sovereign manages debt better, increasing the level of indebtedness with similar or even lower spreads, especially during distress periods. These spreads become less negatively related with output because there is more deleveraging in anticipation to bad productivity, and the countries can reduce the volatility of consumption.====For completeness, we evaluate if our model can replicate the key long run debt statistics and dynamics observed in emerging economies while addressing the three main questions described above. We find that the calibrated model closely mimics the indebtedness and default features documented for emerging countries. Our framework also captures several moments of the debt profile of these economies, such as the level and dynamics of debt duration, maturity, and spreads for different debt maturities. Furthermore, we compare the impulse responses of the model with empirical counterparts estimated with a structural panel-VAR with data for emerging market economies. We find that the model's implications for the dynamics of debt and default risk leading to sovereign debt crises are similar to the data. Incorporating news shocks calibrated to replicate the VAR dynamic relationship between TFP and EMBI does not alter materially the fit of an otherwise standard sovereign default model for standard statistics of emerging markets business cycles. Thus, the quantitative model offers a structural interpretation of our empirical findings.","News, sovereign debt maturity, and default risk",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300684,17 June 2020,2020,Research Article,161.0
McCalman Phillip,"Deaprtment of Economics, University of Melbourne, Australia","Received 30 January 2019, Revised 22 May 2020, Accepted 22 May 2020, Available online 3 June 2020, Version of Record 10 June 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2020.103348,Cited by (2),A central prediction of ==== models is that increased integration leads to specialization. This mechanism has been used to gain insight into the location of ==== due to trade liberalization have especially large welfare benefits for low income consumers.,"The notion that international integration leads to specialization/concentration of production is ubiquitous in trade models. At the industry level, production is specialized/concentrated in countries according to comparative advantage. Within industries, international trade leads to a reallocation of production toward more efficient firms. And in a more recent literature that considers a firm's product range, international trade is a force that leads a firm to rationalize its product portfolio. While it is easy to find cases where firms have reduced their product range as foreign competition increases; nevertheless, there are a number of important examples that run counter to this wisdom.====Consider the “Quartz crisis” in the Swiss watch industry. The introduction of cheap reliable electronic watches in the 1970's by Japanese firms reduced the number of Swiss watchmakers from 1600 in 1970 to 600 by 1983. This reduction is attributed to a continued focus on traditional high quality mechanical watches. 1983 proved to be a pivotal year for the Swiss watchmaking industry. While continuing to produce high end watches, the Swiss industry launched the Swatch aimed at the low end of the market. Contrary to the standard prediction, this cheap plastic watch was an extension of the product range rather than a contraction. Moreover, by the early 1990's, the Swatch was the world's best selling watch.====The Swatch isn't an isolated example. It turns out that the pairing of low end product line extensions and increased competition is observed frequently enough for the business literature to give it a name/s; “fighter brands” or “flanker brands”.==== Take, for example, the introduction of GM's utilitarian Saturn range of small cars in response to the increased US market share of Japanese producer's in the 1980's. This move by GM confounded many industry commentators.==== Especially when compared to the behavior of other incumbents; Peugeot, Renault, Alfa Romeo and Fiat all exited the US market, while Ford and Chrysler stuck with their traditional line-ups. Analysts have also puzzled over behavior in the desktop laser printer market. Why would firms already offering a high quality 10 pages per minute (ppm) printer introduce a lower quality 5 ppm at the same time the number of competitors increased from a handful to over 40? (see Deneckere and Preston McAfee (1996) and Teisberg and Clark (1994)). These examples raise a series of questions. Why do some firms expand their offerings and not others? Why do we observe these extensions only some of the time, while we observe product line rationalization at other times? Do these outcomes have different welfare implications? Are these differences big?====The common thread running through these examples is that entry/competition is associated with some incumbents extending their product range into the low end of the market, a segment they had not been serving. The emphasis on market segments points to a role for consumer heterogeneity; a dimension that has previously been overlooked in the international trade literature. The aim of this paper is to help fill this gap. Moreover, understanding why and when the length of product lines are varied allows for a welfare evaluation of their consequences.====The “versioning” strategy pursued by firms in the examples above is a form of second degree price discrimination, and is also the basis of the model developed below.==== This sales technique is applied in settings where a firm is aware of the distribution of consumer types in the economy but does not observe the type of any given consumer. In this sense, the new margin being added to trade models is the ability of firms to design a menu of options for consumers.==== The purpose of a properly designed menu is to motivate consumers to select items in a fashion consistent with their type.====This behavior has been studied previously in a monopoly setting.==== In contrast, our model considers firms that compete in a monopolistically competitive manner, and additionally, these firms differ in their productivities.==== Together these features form a tractable model which generates a rich set of equilibrium possibilities, including either the expansion or contraction of product lines from seemingly similar shocks that increase competition.====The three dimensions of the model (versioning, monopolistic competition and firm heterogeneity) all retain characteristics familiar from other applications, and it is their interaction that generate the rich results. A key prediction of “versioning” is that offering a low end product comes at the expense of rents foregone from high value customers. For example, offering a low end version (5 ppm printer) provides a viable outside option for the high end customer (who the 10 ppm printer is aimed at) and the price of the high end version needs to reflect this alternative. The foregone rents (or information rents captured by the high types) are an implicit cost of serving the low end, with this implicit cost driven by the difference in valuation between the high and low type for the low end product.====In a monopoly setting this difference in valuations is exogenous, while under monopolistic competition this difference depends on the intensity of competition in each segment; hence, it is endogenous. To accommodate this feature, a translated CES structure is adopted, partially for analytic convenience, but mostly for the type specific choke price it generates.==== The analytic convenience is due to a symmetric demand system across varieties within a type. Combined with the type specific choke prices, this implies that the implicit cost of serving the low type, while endogenous, is the same for all firms.====The cost that differs across firms is the marginal cost of production. Without an implicit cost, the decision to serve a market segment is based on the comparison of the marginal cost (explicit cost) and the segment's choke price. This is the familiar “selection” mechanism. With an implicit cost, the decision to serve the low end deviates from marginal cost. Moreover, the impact of the implicit cost is most pronounced for the higher productivity firms; low productivity firms do not possess an marginal cost that would enable them to serve the low end of the market (their marginal cost is greater than the low end choke price).====The resulting equilibrium is characterized by firms that offer product lines of differing length. Furthermore, the extent to which any firm chooses to (under-) serve the low end of the market is conditional on surplus available in the high end of the market; which itself depends on the degree and nature of competition. This setting provides enough richness to allow insight into why we sometimes observe a set of incumbents extending their product lines, others do nothing and some exit. Yet, in seemingly very similar circumstances we observe a set of incumbents rationalizing their product lines, others do nothing and some exit. Which outcome arises turns on the size of the endogenous implicit cost.====Intuitively, a less competitive environment results in residual demand functions that allow large rents to be extracted by firms. This is especially true at the high end of the market. However, this generates a large implicit cost; hence, only firms with a low explicit cost would consider serving the low end (and even they may not be interested). A shock that induces entry (decline in trade barriers/entry costs, an improvement in technology or market growth) changes the location of the residual demand curves. In particular, the high end residual demand curve shifts in. What about the low end? Consider an extreme situation where in the initial equilibrium no firm serves the low end of the market (so it's residual demand is not altered by competition and exists as a latent market segment). Then the inward shift of the residual demand curve at the high end reduces the implicit cost of serving the low type. At some stage this process will induce the best firms to enter the low end of the market. This is a very pro-competitive outcome; the high productivity firms always had the capability of serving the low end, but they chose not to. The end result is increased competition coinciding with product line extensions. Consistent with the seemingly confounding behavior in the watch, auto and printer markets.====If instead we consider a setting where competition is already intense, then the rents available are smaller. This produces a relatively small implicit cost. A shock that induces entry once again shifts in the residual demand functions. However, the change in implicit cost won't be large. Consequently, the “selection” mechanism dominates; Do I have a marginal cost lower enough to operate? Do I have a low enough cost to serve the low end? Since the shock shifts the residual demand curves inward, the answer to these questions for a set of incumbent firms will now be no. Some firms exit and some rationalize their product lines as competition increases. Now increased competition and product line rationalization coincide.====The differing predictions also generate differences in the magnitude of welfare changes. If product line rationalization is a feature of the equilibrium response, then the welfare benefits reflect tougher selection into the market; gains arise as high cost firms are replaced by lower cost firms. However, if a set of firms extend their product lines, this has a disproportionately large impact on the welfare of the low income consumers.====There are two sources to this gain; the usual gain from overall selection into the market, along with a new extensive margin gain that occurs exclusively for the low income segment. This new margin can result in a substantial boost in welfare. In particular, based on standard parameter choices, this new margin can predict gains from trade for the low income group to be over 10 percentage points larger than those implied by selection alone. The size of these benefits point to an important new dimension, that of the distribution of gains, in the search for the elusive pro-competitive effects of trade.====The mechanism I emphasize differs from the usual incentives assumed to underlie multi-product firms. One popular motivation is based on core competency; a firm is good at producing a specific variety and this aptitude carries over imperfectly to nearby varieties.==== In these models, the varieties are distinct, so a consumer would be willing to add all of them to their within sector consumption basket – the emphasis is on firms introducing additional horizontally differentiated varieties. A related approach assumes that a firm receives a random draw for capabilities across multiple goods/sectors. In this case, each firm produces at most one good in each “nest” of the utility function.==== To focus on the independent operation of the extension/selection mechanism, I rule out each of these standard motivations by assuming that firms cannot adapt to produce a related but distinct variety and that their capability is only within a single sector. Instead I highlight the ability of a firm to produce different versions of its variety. This captures Hewlett-Packard offering high and low end laser printers; both embody similar technology and the choice of the consumer is within variety. Hence, I focus on vertical product lines rather than horizontal product lines (the subject of the previous literature).====To derive and develop these results the paper has the following structure. First, a closed economy model is introduced. The equilibrium must satisfy the familiar free entry and zero cut-off profit conditions. The new dimension is that both of these conditions depend not only on the maximum cost consistent with survival in the market but also a separate lower maximum cost that defines the minimum efficiency level necessary to serve the low income segment. As is standard in the literature, the perturbation considered is variation in market size. Small markets have less competitive outcomes and are the most likely to be associated with product line extensions. An open economy version of the model is then considered. Changes in trade costs provides a realistic source of variation in the degree of competition. In line with the closed economy results, high trade barriers are consistent with less competitive outcomes and therefore are most likely to be associated with product line extensions when trade barriers are reduced. Additionally, insight is also gained into which firms add low end options in the domestic market, and which firms expand in their export markets at the low end (over and above what would be expected from changes in market access). When trade barriers are unilaterally reduced, welfare benefits occur in the short run, and also in the long run, provided the reduction in trade barriers is sufficiently large, a finding that contrasts with the existing literature. In all these cases, product line extensions disproportionally benefit the low income segment of the market, gains which directly stem from the pro-competitive effect of either unilateral or reciprocal trade liberalization.","International trade, product lines and welfare: The roles of firm and consumer heterogeneity",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300647,3 June 2020,2020,Research Article,162.0

Moreover, input tariff reductions widen both the income and the health gaps between skilled and unskilled workers. Further welfare analysis indicates that ignoring health outcomes would substantially underestimate the welfare disparity between skilled and unskilled workers.","Can intermediate input trade liberalization affect worker health in a developing country like China, and if so, how? Do the impacts differ between skilled and unskilled workers? What are the welfare implications of input tariff reductions once health factors are taken into considerations? In this study, we aim to investigate these important yet unsettled research questions using China's World Trade Organization (WTO) accession as a natural experiment.====We focus on China for several reasons. First, China is the world's largest exporting economy and also has the largest working population. Understanding the health outcomes of its trade policy and the welfare implications is a research issue of first order importance. Second, China's WTO accession offers an ideal setting to examine this issue. As a nation-wide event, it is exogenous to individual firms. But due to differences in initial industry composition of labor, its impact varies across Chinese prefectures. We can exploit this regional variation to identity its impact on worker health. Third, because of weak labor protections, the adverse health effect of trade liberalization is likely to be more pronounced in China compare to advanced economies. Our findings thus would also be relevant for assessing welfare implications of trade liberalization for other developing countries that want to modernize.====We start our analysis by documenting four stylized facts regarding China's input tariff reductions and changes in Chinese manufacturing workers' health status following its WTO accession. Drawing evidence from Chinese trade data and the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) database, we show that following China's WTO accession: (1) import tariffs are reduced substantially, and the reductions apply mainly to imported intermediate inputs; (2) manufacturing workers are more likely to experience illness or injury; (3) manufacturing workers also work longer hours and receive higher wage incomes; (4) both the income gap and the health gap between skilled and unskilled workers widen.====To rationalize these facts and to motivate our empirical exercises, we first build an illustrative model linking input tariff reductions to firm behavior, workers' supply of labor, and their health status. In our model, firms choose the number of workers and each worker's optimal working time. The optimal working time and the employment mass are substitutes and are both decreasing functions of the wage rate. To hire workers, firms need to pay a search cost (e.g., Helpman and Helpman and Itskhoki, 2010; Helpman et al., 2010). The impact of a reduction in input tariffs on firms' demand of working time can be illustrated intuitively using a simple diagram (Fig. 1). A reduction in input tariffs lowers a firm's marginal costs and increases its profit. The demand curve for working time is accordingly shifted to the right.====Workers in our model choose optimal working time to maximize their utility. The supply curve of working time is an increasing function of the wage rate. Based on existing findings in the labor economics literature (e.g., Juhn et al., 1991, Juhn et al., 2002), we assume that the elasticity of labor supply to the wage rate is lower for skilled workers. As a result, in Fig. 1, the supply curve of working time for skilled workers is steeper than that for unskilled workers. Consequently, a rightward shift of the demand curve following trade liberalization has differential effects on skilled and unskilled workers. While equilibrium working hours and wage increase for both types of workers, the increase in working hours (wage) for unskilled workers is larger (smaller). Since longer working hours lead to a higher probability of getting injury or illness (e.g., Rod et al., 2017; Hamermesh et al., 2017; Berniell and Bietenbeck, 2018), both the income gap and health gap widen following trade liberalization.====We then put the predictions of our theoretical model into a test. Following the literature (e.g., Amiti and Konings, 2007; Topalova, 2010), we construct a prefecture-level input tariff shock measure using Chinese provincial-level input-output table and the prefecture-level initial industry composition of labor. Employing the CHNS database, we find strong empirical evidence supporting our model's predictions. We show that manufacturing workers in Chinese prefectures that had a larger exposure to input tariff reduction shocks experienced a significantly higher likelihood of suffering from illness or injury. This finding is not affected by controlling for other trade shocks and pollution variables. It is also robust to using only the two waves of the survey data closest to China's WTO accession. In a comprehensive set of tests, we also rule out the possibility that our results are driven by pre-existing trends. Additional evidence from the placebo tests lends further support to our hypotheses.====We then move one step forward to examine the differential effects of input tariff liberalization on workers with different skill levels. We show that input trade reductions not only widen the income gap between skilled and unskilled workers but also have a significantly larger adverse effect on health conditions of the unskilled. To shed light on the underlying channel, we also investigate the effects of input tariff reductions on daily working hours. Consistent with our theoretical model, we find that input tariff reductions also have a significantly larger effect on working hours for the unskilled.====Finally, we conduct a welfare analysis based on our model and the empirical results. We find that taking the health effect into consideration is quantitatively important for correctly calculating the welfare disparity between skilled and unskilled workers. The welfare disparity becomes significantly larger if health factors are accounted for. For instance, consider workers with above compulsory level education and those with compulsory level education or below, ignoring the differential effects on health would result in an underestimation of welfare disparity by 17.44%.====Our study contributes to the relevant literature in the following aspects. First, a growing literature has recently started to examine the health effects of trade shocks. Existing contributions have focused primarily on the health effects of import competition or export expansion.==== For example, McManus and Schaur (2016) find that the growth in Chinese imports in the U.S. significantly increased worker injury and illness rates in competing industries. Pierce and Schott (2016a) show that U.S. counties more exposed to an exogenous trade liberalization exhibit higher rates of suicide. On export expansion, Oster (2012) finds that exports affect the incidence of HIV in Africa. Hummels et al. (2016) show that Danish workers experience worse health outcomes as exports increase. Bombardini and Li (2016) is perhaps the only existing study that focuses on China. The authors identify a pollution channel through which the expansion in exports affect infant mortality rates in China during the period of 1990–2010.====Our paper departs from existing studies in several key aspects. First, while existing work studies import competition or export expansion, we analyze the health effects of input tariff liberalization. Second, existing studies examine mainly rich countries. Our focus here is on China. The trade shocks caused by its WTO accession are large in magnitude and their health implications remain under-explored. Third, we also examine the heterogeneous effects across different skill levels and take them into consideration in our welfare analysis. Finally, our study is closely related to Hummels et al. (2016). In addition to the differences mentioned above, the empirical strategies adopted in the two studies are also quite different. Hummels et al. (2016) use Danish matched employer-employee data and an IV approach to identify the health effect of exogenous changes in firm exports. Ours employs the CHNS data and follows the approach of Amiti and Konings (2007) to exploit prefecture level variations in input tariff shocks.====Second, there is also a large literature that examines the effects of China's WTO entry on outcomes in China and on its trading partners. For example, Han et al. (2016) study the role of market structure in determining the distributional effects of trade liberalization in China. Brandt et al. (2017) examine the effects of China's WTO accession on the evolution of markups and productivity of its manufacturing firms. Erten and Leight (2020) and Facchini et al. (2019) study the impacts of the reduction in trade policy uncertainty associated with China's WTO accession on structural transformation in China and China's “Great Migration”, respectively. Feng et al. (2017) explore how the trade uncertainty shock affects firm exports in China. Our study differs from these existing contributions by focusing on the health effects of China's trade liberalization.====Previous studies have also paid attention to China's rise in trade on its trading partners (e.g., Autor et al., 2013, Autor et al., 2015; Autor et al., 2014; Acemoglu et al., 2016; McManus and Schaur, 2016; Pierce and Schott, 2016a, Pierce and Schott, 2016b). Whereas they investigate mainly the benefits and costs of the China trade shock on its trading partners, we show that China's rise in trade also has important health consequences on its own manufacturing workers.====Third, our paper is related to the literature that examines the impacts of greater access to imported intermediate inputs on firm performance. Existing studies in this literature have explored the impacts of access to imported inputs on several aspects of firm performance, including total factor productivity (e.g., Amiti and Konings, 2007; Kasahara and Rodrigue, 2008; Halpern et al., 2015), product scope (e.g., Goldberg et al., 2010), and export quality (e.g., Bas and Strauss-Kahn, 2015; Fan et al., 2015, Fan et al., 2018). We add to this literature by offering new results on worker health.====Our work also contributes to the literature on globalization and income inequality between skilled and unskilled labor. Previous studies have examined the effects of trade liberalization on income inequality in various counties. For example, Han et al. (2012) show that trade liberalization increases income inequality in China. Feenstra and Hanson (1999) find that wage inequality increases in the United States after outsourcing. Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007) document that wage inequality rises in many developing countries following trade liberalization. Helpman et al. (2010) predict that trade liberalization first increases wage inequality and then decreases it. Existing work has also explored the underlying mechanisms for the increased inequality across education levels, including the need for skill upgrading due to new technology adoption (Bustos, 2011), product quality upgrading (Verhoogen, 2008), and increasing relative demand for services of more skilled labor (Brambilla et al., 2012). In addition to education, related studies also find that worker industry affiliation (Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2005) and firm affiliation (Amiti and Davis, 2012) play important roles in determining the trade effects on income inequality. Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007) and Pavcnik (2017) provide detailed reviews of the literature. As a complement to existing studies, we show that input trade liberalization increases not only wage inequality but health disparity as well.====Finally, it is important to acknowledge that trade liberalization can affect worker health through several different channels, such as other policy changes associated with trade liberalization and the pollution channel identified in Bombardini and Li (2016). We thus would like to emphasize that our focus in this study is on only one channel, the input tariff reduction channel. Nonetheless, in our empirical analysis, we will try to control for other potential channels.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers some background information on China's WTO accession and presents some stylized facts. In Section 3, we build a simple model to explain the stylized facts and to guide our empirical exercises. Section 4 describes our data and empirical strategy, and Section 5 provides our main empirical results. In Section 6, we conduct a welfare analysis based on our model and empirical results.

By examining export data from Chinese customs, we find persistent lexicographic biases in firm-level export records. Firms whose names are lexicographically earlier in the Chinese-character rank export more to countries that have greater language proximities to Chinese, while firms whose names are lexicographically earlier in the English-romanization rank export more to countries that have greater language proximities to English. The lexicographic biases signify linguistic visibility as a source of comparative advantage in ====.","The name of a firm sets its identity. Firm names may serve business functions such as signaling locations, products, or brands, but their main function is to distinguish firms from each other. Firms are searched for and recognized by potential clients by name. Having a name with a lexicographically earlier initial (such as A) has been found to be advantageous in quasi-business activities, including charitable solicitation (Meer and Rosen, 2011), stock picking (Jacobs and Hillert, 2016; Itzkowitz et al., 2016), and academic publishing (Einav and Yariv, 2006; Ray and Robson, 2018). Sales is a core business in any firm, and we are interested in how the lexicographic ranks of firms affect their sales.====We choose Chinese firms as our research subject for three reasons. First, unlike Indo-European languages, Chinese is culturally isolated from most other languages in the world. Therefore, the cultural connotations conveyed by the names of Chinese firms are unlikely to influence their foreign sales. Second, every Chinese firm has two lexicographic ranks, one based on its Chinese-character name, and the other based on its English-romanized name. This doubles the data variations and provides identification benefits. Third, Chinese firms export to many foreign markets. Linguists have constructed language proximities between every language (such as Chinese or English) and all other languages in the world. Combining the foreign markets of Chinese firms with the world language proximity matrix, we can estimate the impacts of lexicographic ranks on sales across foreign markets that speak different languages.====Here is an example that illustrates our identification strategy. Take the Chinese electronics giant ====, for instance. Its Chinese name, as shown in Fig. 1, has two characters. Just as in English, the initial (first character) in its name determines the lexicographic ranks of this firm in relation to others. The first character has a ==== determined by the Chinese lexicography (number of strokes), and a ==== determined by the English lexicography (modern English alphabet). By interacting (i) the character rank with every foreign market's language proximity to Chinese, and (ii) the romanization rank with every foreign market's language proximity to English, we formulate a dual difference-in-differences strategy to estimate how a lexicographically earlier (according to either rank) firm name generates advantages in foreign markets that speak more proximate (to either language) languages.====We find that firms with lexicographically earlier character names export more to destination countries that have greater language proximities to Chinese, while firms with lexicographically earlier romanized names export more to destination countries that have greater language proximities to English. Such lexicographic biases are especially strong among exporters with low visibility in their businesses. Quantitatively, when an exporter moves down the lexicographic ranks from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile, and meanwhile the foreign market's language proximity increases from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile, its export volume decreases by one to 3%.====The lexicographic biases stem from language-related information frictions in global business. In countries whose languages are linguistically remote from Chinese, learning and using Chinese is costly. The harder it is for locals in a given country to learn and use Chinese, the less likely the local importers in that country are to be biased by the Chinese-character lexicography. The same reasoning applies to English, which is more widely used than Chinese outside of Asia and has an even stricter lexicographic order than Chinese. The harder it is for a foreign market to learn and use English, the less likely its importers are to be biased by the English alphabet.====The contributions of our paper are threefold. First, our results imply that lexicographic biases are more pervasive than have been documented in the literature. The lexicographic biases documented currently are limited to English language and Anglo-cultural environments (Einav and Yariv, 2006; Jacobs and Hillert, 2016; Itzkowitz et al., 2016; Meer and Rosen, 2011; Ray and Robson, 2018). The fact that Chinese is not as widely used as English does not eliminate the lexicographic biases caused by the Chinese-character lexicography in overseas markets. Lexicographic biases are also not limited to the “new economy.” Charitable solicitation, stock picking, and academic publishing, as covered in the literature, are highly computerized and thus heavily affected by automated alphabetic sorting done by machines. International goods trading is far less machine-driven. Notwithstanding the use of the internet in international trade, samples of goods are physically examined, prices are orally negotiated, and business skills are needed to make deals in global trade practices. Finding similar lexicographic biases in this traditional business context is noteworthy.====Second, this study advances our understanding of the role of language in international trade. Languages influence information flows, trust, and trade costs. The literature has shown that whether two countries share a common language has a tremendous impact on their trade with each other (Melitz, 2008; Egger and Lassmann, 2012; Melitz and Toubal, 2014; Egger and Lassmann, 2015; Egger and Toubal, 2016), and that translation costs are an important trade barrier (Lohmann, 2011; Molnar, 2013; Brynjolfsson et al., 2019). Extending this literature, our study identifies having an earlier lexicographic rank as a visibility advantage for exporting firms. The lexicographic biases found in our study are bilateral. Heuristically, is exporter A advantaged over exporter Z in terms of visibility? The answer is yes if the importer's language is proximate to English. Think about an importer who faces a long list of foreign exporters to contact. If she happens to speak English, exporter A is more visible to her eyes, and therefore more likely to be contacted and to have deals arranged. This advantage is relative, since the visibility advantage of exporter A does not exist in foreign markets where the languages spoken by importers have nothing in common with English.====Lastly, this paper sheds light on how searches are conducted in international trade. The literature has examined various search mechanisms, through profitability updating (Rauch and Casella, 2003; Albornoz et al., 2012), foreign marketing (Arkolakis, 2010), sequential searching (Allen, 2014), and networking (Rauch, 1999, Rauch, 2001; Rauch and Trindade, 2002; Rauch and Watson, 2004; Chaney, 2014). There has been less understanding about what information on firms is being searched. The names of firms establish their a priori identities. They are unique and searchable, but should not matter in their own right if information is symmetric.==== We show that the names of firms do matter significantly in both economic and statistical senses, indicating that the information in international trade is less symmetric than expected, and probably far less symmetric than what most trade models assume.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our customs data, the Chinese language and its dual-lexicographic system, and language proximity measures across countries.

Trade creates value, in part, by offering a mechanism for risk sharing, and risk sharing is most effective when both parties are uninformed.","In any discussion of frictions in cross-border trade, inevitably one that arises concerns information and uncertainty. Portes and Rey (2005) show that the volume of phone calls between two countries predicts how much they trade. Gould (1994) and Rauch and Trindade (2002) argue that immigrants trade more with their home countries. The argument is so simple that it needs no formalization: information frictions create uncertainty, and this uncertainty deters risk-averse exporters. In this paper, we show that uncertainty can fuel more trade in a simple general equilibrium trade model.====Anecdotal evidence suggests that the effects of uncertainty on trade are far from clear. There has been increased uncertainty about the future international trading environment, with the United States government adopting a hostile stance to existing trade agreements and others threatening retaliation. In particular, measures of policy uncertainty have increased dramatically since late 2016; see, e.g., Fig. 1. Despite this uncertain environment, U.S. exports have grown by 17% since early 2016.====In a simple general equilibrium trade model with information frictions, we show how outcomes of this nature—uncertainty-fueled booms in trade—are possible. We deliver two insights about the relationship between uncertainty and international trade. The first concerns mechanics: Uncertainty increases both the mean and the variance in the returns to exporting. The implication is that trade can increase or decrease with uncertainty, depending on preferences over these different forces. Under general conditions on preferences, we characterize the importance of these forces using a sufficient statistics approach. Once one understands certain risk, prudence, and temperance properties of preferences, changes in mean and variance are sufficient to characterize the change in trade flows to aggregate uncertainty. In the commonly used CES case, these sufficient statistics simply boil down to functions of the elasticity of substitution across home and foreign varieties, or “trade elasticity.”====The second insight regards interpretation: Uncertainty facilitates cross-country risk sharing and, hence, more trade. When uncertainty is high, other countries do not realize that bad states of nature are prevailing domestically. Their exports provide the home country with lots of goods in exactly the states in which consumption is most needed. In contrast, when uncertainty is low, this risk-sharing mechanism is muted; informed countries substitute away from trade in states in which they would prefer to not insure their trading partner. Thus, one interpretation of our results is that uncertainty-fueled increases in trade occur because risk sharing is most effective when both parties are uninformed.====The role of theory is to clarify thinking. Thinking about uncertainty and trade has been focused on one channel. The model uncovers multiple ways in which trade and uncertainty are related. The results guide our thinking about what constitutes aggregate uncertainty and what its cross-border effect might be. Our results do not prove that uncertainty increases trade. But if uncertainty is a trade barrier, the results teach us that many standard parameterized trade models are logically inconsistent with that finding. Either our thinking about uncertainty and trade, or our models, should change.====We demonstrate these results in a standard, simple general equilibrium trade model—a two-good, two-country Armington model. We introduce cross-country uncertainty in the most obvious way: Each country experiences a random shock that affects its export choice. Home firms observe home shocks perfectly. Foreigners observe foreign shocks perfectly. But each group observes the other's shocks imperfectly, with a noisy signal. Then every firm chooses how much to export to an international market. The international relative price clears that market, goods are immediately shipped to their destination country, and agents consume.====In our model, uncertainty is about another country's endowment. But endowment risk is a simple economic primitive that is a stand-in for many other sorts of uncertainty. For example, uncertainty about the quality of foreign exports or preference shocks is isomorphic to the model we wrote down. Similarly, the endowment could represent production, net of deadweight “iceberg” losses, created by trade policy. Trade policy uncertainty creates randomness in the residual supply. What matters to an exporting firm is not the source of uncertainty or the quantity or quality of foreign exports; it cares about the distribution of the relative price of their good. Section 3 establishes that the key to our results is that this relative price has a distribution that is right-skewed. Such a distribution arises naturally in this context because terms of trade are never negative, but can be arbitrarily large. If some uncertain outcome makes the right-skewed terms of trade more variable, it raises risk—but, under some plausible conditions, also raises the average relative price. These competing mean and variance forces are central to our analysis, and arise in settings in which aggregate uncertainty affects trade.====Our analysis proceeds in several steps. First, we consider the effects of uncertainty on the terms of trade. The key insight is that—in general equilibrium—uncertainty affects not only the volatility, but also the expected terms of trade. Mathematically, the mechanism is that uncertainty impairs home agents' ability to condition their exporting behavior on the foreign country's state (and vice versa). As a result, home and foreign exports covary less. In equilibrium, the terms of trade depend on the ratio of home and foreign exports. If home and foreign exports are always proportional, the terms of trade are constant. Less coordination creates more volatile terms of trade. The mechanism encodes the conventional wisdom that uncertainty deters risk-averse exporters from exporting.====This conventional wisdom, however, is incomplete. A fall in export covariance causes the numerator and denominator of the terms of trade to covary less, while always remaining positive. This results in terms of trade that occasionally reach a very high level, but never fall below zero. When such a positive ratio varies more, its mean increases. Thus, high uncertainty, which results in more volatile terms of trade, also increases the expected level of the terms of trade, making exporting more lucrative on average.====The effect of information on the risk and the expected return from exporting permeates a broad class of general equilibrium trade models. However, how risk and return affect the incentives—to export and which effect dominates—depends on preferences and their parameters. While our analysis ultimately identifies fundamental features of preferences that cause information to affect trade volumes one way or another we begin with a specific but commonly used form of preferences to identify these forces in a well-understood setting and build intuition for how and why they arise. With constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences, these comparative statics boil down to functions of the elasticity of substitution across home and foreign varieties. If goods are highly substitutable, the risk effect dominates and information frictions decrease trade. When goods are less substitutable, the rise in the expected terms of trade more than offsets the increase in risk, and firms choose to export more when information is less precise. In other words, uncertainty facilitates trade.====With other preferences outside the CES class, the same forces are at play, but may result in different net effects on trade volume. One possibility is that the increase in the terms of trade can reduce exports. The logic is that if I am expecting to get lots of the foreign good back in return for my exports, and I like a balanced consumption bundle, then I should export less when the relative price of my good rises. Otherwise, I will have too much of the foreign good to consume. Another possibility is that when the terms of trade become more uncertain, an agent chooses to export more for purely precautionary reasons. Our general results characterize preferences where substitution or precautionary effects dominate. We can distinguish these well-understood substitution and precaution effects from our equilibrium terms of trade effect.====These arguments have a tight link to risk-sharing and insurance motives. We point out how the change in covariance, which governs risk sharing, affects the mean return to trade. How uncertainty actually affects trade volume depends on which of these forces—the increase in risk or increase in return—dominate. One obvious reason that uncertainty might encourage more trade is that agents have precautionary motives to trade. Agents who export, not knowing how much of the foreign good they will get in return, might export more to make sure they get enough of the foreign good back. For preferences with the right type of curvature, precautionary exporting emerges. But even when preferences do not normally induce precautionary behavior, we show that equilibrium movements in the terms of trade can induce countries to export more in the face of more mutual uncertainty. Just as borrowing constraints can change interest rate dynamics to induce precautionary behavior in a savings problem, equilibrium movements in the terms of trade can induce precautionary exporting in trade models with a wide range of non-precautionary preferences.====In other words, the terms of trade vary, in such a way as to share risk between countries (Cole and Obstfeld, 1991). When uncertainty is low, the terms of trade vary less and pose less risk to the exporter. But terms of trade that are not variable cannot hedge risk effectively. As uncertainty rises, and the terms of trade are less predictable, they also covary more negatively with endowments, so as to hedge each country's risk. This is what makes trade more attractive.====Our results rely on the assumption that there are no financial instruments or contracts that formally share risk. Just as in Newbery and Stiglitz (1984), we eliminate such instruments because we cannot logically study uncertainty if all uncertainty can be hedged and thereby effectively eliminated. We relax this restriction and describe the average amount of trade in settings in which some agents can write fully state-contingent contracts and others cannot. We find that allowing more risk-sharing works just like reducing uncertainty. If you can condition exports on the realized price, then it is just like knowing the price. Both reduce the average amount of trade.====Our results are most applicable to existing trading relationships. Our argument does not apply when two countries are new trading partners and many new trading relationships are potentially being formed. The reason is that new trading relationships surely involve fixed costs to set up. Uncertainty affects the willingness to bear those fixed costs in a way that is not captured by this model. However, much of the world's trade takes place between trading partners that are already established, like the U.S. and Mexican car manufacturers. The question there is not whether to start exporting, but how much to trade within an existing relationship. This question is a natural starting point because the setting is simpler, but also because the answer is more surprising.",Can global uncertainty promote international trade?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300635,30 May 2020,2020,Research Article,165.0

We exploit firm-level panel data on product and process innovation activities in the United Kingdom and find that the large, unanticipated, low-skill labor supply (immigration) shock generated by the 2004 expansion of the European Union to Eastern European countries increased process innovation and reduced product innovation, with overall innovation activity going up. This implies that the innovation response to labor supply shocks may be more nuanced than the previous literature has suggested. Both of these effects are increasing in the low-skill intensity of firm production. In addition, the reduction in product innovation is lessened for firms whose output is sold locally, which is consistent with a demand side effect generated by the labor supply shock.","The impact of immigration on local economies is the subject of a large literature. Among other important findings, there is strong evidence that even large inflows of immigrant workers produce little impact on native employment rates and wages (see Card (2012) for a discussion). Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this. For instance, it has been shown that native and immigrant workers in many cases have complementary skills, even within low-education skill categories, which leads to productivity gains when these workers are used together (Peri and Sparber, 2009). At the firm level, there is evidence that firms alter their production methods to use the now more abundant factor more intensively (e.g., Dustmann and Glitz (2015) and Lewis (2013)) while, possibly at the same time, adjusting their capital stock or adopting new technologies in response to the labor supply shock (e.g., Lewis, 2011; Lewis, 2013; Lafortune et al., 2019; Ottaviano and Peri, 2012), both of which may mitigate any local wage and employment effects. More generally, Acemoglu (1998) argues that firms will respond to changing skill supplies and premia by re-optimizing over the technologies used. In this paper, we explore two channels of firm response to labor supply shocks, namely, changes arising from process innovations and changes in firms' products due to product innovations, both of which may impact the distribution of output and employment within and across firms, with subsequent welfare consequences for workers.====There is little extant literature that separately relates labor supply shocks to process or product innovations, though Lewis (2013) outlines a range of potential firm responses, some of which are consistent with the mechanisms we present here.==== This gap in the literature is somewhat surprising, as process innovations have been shown to be a key aspect of the firm response to technology adoption==== and international trade,==== suggesting that labor supply shocks may also induce these types of responses. Here we provide evidence to this effect.==== In addition, we provide new evidence on the role that labor supply shocks play in firms' decisions regarding optimal product scope and quality (product innovations).====Generally speaking, the welfare consequences of process and product innovations are likely to be of first order importance, via well-known channels. Falling production costs due to process innovations will typically lead to price reductions and corresponding welfare gains. Relatedly, Cortes (2008) shows that immigrants reduce prices of immigrant-intensive output, though in that case it is by reducing wages, and hence production costs. The channel we explore in this paper is an additional potential mechanism through which production costs and prices may fall due to increased immigration, in this case via increased process innovation. At the same time, increased process innovation may straightforwardly raise worker incomes by increasing firm productivity (e.g., see Huergo and Jaumandreu (2004) or Bloom et al. (2016)). And finally, product innovations should lead to a fall in the price index, and will thus increase welfare, by expanding the range of available product varieties or reducing quality-adjusted prices (e.g., see Feenstra (1994) or Eizenberg (2014)).====At the level of the firm, Table 1 presents estimates of “innovation premia”, which are the estimates from a simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression of firm outcomes on an indicator for either product or process innovation (Section 4 describes the dataset). We alternately report estimates with and without firm fixed effects. Overall, we see that both product and process innovation are associated with greater firm revenue and employment, and more R&D. In addition, product innovation is associated with greater output and employment relative to process innovation. Though these estimates are clearly not identified, they are suggestive of an important role for innovation in firm outcomes, consistent with a large literature. We return to these correlations in our discussion of the empirical results in Section 6.====We exploit the expansion of the European Union (EU) to Eastern Europe in 2004 as a differential, and large, shock to the supply of low-skill labor across UK local labor markets. This large inflow of immigrants to the UK was mostly unanticipated since, historically, the UK was a low-immigration country and expert predictions of the potential inflows due to the expansion were quite small. Using firm-level panel data on product and process innovation activities, we estimate difference-in-differences specifications that produce consistent results. We first find that the immigration shock increased process innovation, on average. Noting that firms are likely to respond to supply shocks very differently, we then explore heterogeneity in the response, finding that the response was increasing in firms' low-skill production intensity as well as firm size. We also find that product innovation ==== in response to the migration, an effect that is greater within low-skill intensive firms but smaller for firms whose output is sold locally. We interpret this last finding as evidence on the importance of a demand side effect.====Existing research on the impact of labor supply shocks on innovation has typically focused on the impact of high-skill immigrants on patenting and overall knowledge creation. For instance, Stuen et al. (2012) exploit a shock to the supply of foreign doctoral students in science to measure their impact on knowledge creation in the U.S., finding a large, positive impact. Hunt (2011) also looks at the impact of immigrant students and finds that they patent at twice the rate of natives and are more concentrated in research-intensive fields such as science and engineering, but do not crowd out native innovation. Kerr (2013) provides a comprehensive review of studies looking at skilled immigration and innovation outcomes as proxied by patenting and firm starts. For the U.S., immigrants are found to play an important role in maintaining the country's position as the technological leader in many fields, and particularly across STEM fields, with Chinese- and Indian-born innovators being especially important in these areas. Another strand of work argues that diversity among high-skill workers leads to higher levels of productivity and innovation, because diversity implies the interaction of complementary workers (see, for example, Ozgen et al. (2013)).====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some stylized facts. In Section 3 we present a conceptual framework to guide the empirical analysis. Section 4 describes the data.

For this, we propose a ==== in the formal sector, are key to obtain a countercyclical informality rate. In our model, the presence of an informal sector might help to mitigate the impact of a stringent labor regulation on employment and consumption fluctuations. In that sense, it adds flexibility to the economy in its adjustment to shocks, but at the cost of a lower productivity and an excess TFP and output volatility. Reducing the burden of labor regulation to the formal sector might achieve the goal of reducing output volatility while improving at the same time the efficiency in the allocation of resources.","One key difference between emerging and developed countries is the incidence of informality, broadly defined as the set of labor relations that occur outside the scope of regulation involving employment protection or preclude the access to social security benefits. Perhaps in response to a more rigid labor regulation and a weaker enforcement of it, the size of the informal sector is much larger in emerging economies (Loayza, 1996; Schneider, 2007). Our goal is to study how regulation and informality affects the adjustment of the economy and its labor market in response to macroeconomic shocks.====Table 1 serves as a motivation by assembling business cycle facts and labor market indicators for a set of emerging and developed countries. The comparison is stark. Relative to developed countries, emerging economies feature high output volatility but smaller employment fluctuations with respect to output (columns 1 and 2). This apparent rigidity shows up in more restrictive labor regulations, measured as a larger number of weeks of wages paid in the event of a separation (columns 3 and 4). The last two columns suggest that the consequences of these regulations might be pervasive, as a larger fraction of employment in emerging economies works under informality conditions.====Cross-country comparisons though helpful are also superficial in their nature. A more concrete assessment of the adjustment of the labor market requires the identification of the relevant occupational categories and a careful analysis of the flows among them. We take Mexico as a benchmark country owing to its high incidence of informality and the availability of granular data to construct labor market gross flows for the period 2005–16. Our main empirical contribution is to provide a comprehensive characterization of the labor market dynamics in Mexico along the business cycle.====As documented elsewhere, we show that the share of informal workers in overall employment (the informality rate) is countercyclical. However, we challenge the view of this rising share as resulting from a reallocation of workers from the formal to the informal sector in recessions. We document that informal employment (divided by working-age population) falls slightly at the onset of recessions only to recover quickly afterwards, while formal employment carries the chief burden. A procyclical labor force participation and a countercyclical unemployment help to reconcile this asymmetric response.====We construct gross flows for the Mexican labor market and show that informal employment responds weakly to the business cycle as a result of job destruction to inactivity partially offsetting job reallocation from the formal sector. The plunge of formal employment during downturns is explained by the feeble job creation from unemployment and inactivity together with some job reallocation towards the informal sector. All in all, formal job creation from inactivity drives most of the fluctuations in the overall employment rate. The view that we challenge has ignored the role of the participation margin and placed excessive emphasis on informality as a buffer.====These facts point to a rich mechanism of employment adjustment over the business cycle in emerging economies. Our second contribution is to propose a business cycle model for a small open economy, including both formal and informal (self-employment) sectors, search frictions in the formal labor market, and endogenous participation in the labor force. As part of the institutional arrangement, we include payroll taxes and firing costs adding to the labor cost in the formal sector.====The model generates business cycle fluctuations in response to two shocks: an aggregate technology shock and a foreign real interest rate shock. We calibrate the model to key moments of the Mexican economy in 2005–16 and show that our baseline economy is consistent with the observed dynamics of different occupational categories. In particular, the model delivers a countercyclical informality rate, even with neutral technology shocks. Moreover, fluctuations in the informality rate are driven by job creation in the formal sector, as suggested by the empirical evidence.====In the model, a negative technology shock reduces output and employment but has almost no impact on the informality rate. In contrast, an increase in the foreign real interest rate is contractionary only to the formal sector, acting through a fall in the present value of a job for a formal entrepreneur by increasing the rate at which future payoffs are discounted. This makes posting a vacancy less profitable, similar to the argument spelled out in Hall (2017). Because of regulation formal labor relations last longer than in the informal sector, in agreement to the data.====The interaction between the two shocks account for one of our main empirical contributions: a countercyclical informality rate driven mostly by fluctuations in formal employment. As a supplement, our model delivers a countercyclical foreign real interest rate, even though we assume independent processes for the two aggregate shocks, making consumption more volatile than output and thus matching a well-known regularity in emerging economies.====We use the model to ask two policy questions: What are the effects on the informal sector and the business cycle of taxing informal earnings? And, what is the impact of reducing the burden of labor regulation on the formal sector instead? We show that, confronted with similar shocks, the economy with a formalization policy acting as a stick to informal workers (rather than a carrot to formal employment) would feature higher volatility in consumption, but smaller fluctuations in employment, output, and measured total factor productivity (TFP). Informality thus provides a margin of adjustment in the presence of a stringent labor regulation at a cost in TFP volatility.====As to the second question, an economy with lower costs of formality would feature, in steady state, a larger pool of formal workers. The long-run TFP effects of reducing the size of the informal sector would be large, around 5–6%. Moreover, this economy would exhibit larger volatility in employment but smaller TFP fluctuations. The effects on productivity are large enough to pull output volatility downwards. The results of this exercise are broadly consistent with Table 1.====We borrow from a recent literature on informality and business cycles. Restrepo-Echavarria (2014) and Fernández and Meza (2015) use two-sector models with competitive labor markets and argue that the reallocation of labor between sectors is important to understand business cycles in emerging economies. By requiring different technology shocks in each sector, they highlight the role played by informality in cushioning overall employment drops. The lesser demand for formal employment in response to a negative technology shock is partially offset by an expansion of the informal sector. Horvath (2018) adds interest rate shocks and a working capital constraint to the purchase of labor services, limiting the access to credit to firms in the formal sector.====None of the previous models allow for unemployment. Albrecht et al. (2009) add an informal sector to a standard matching model to assess the impact of labor market policies on steady state outcomes only. Bosch and Esteban-Pretel (2012) use a matching model to analyze creation and destruction of formal and informal jobs over the business cycle. Finkelstein Shapiro (2014) argues that the presence of idle resources in recessions favors a recovery led by the self-employed.====One way to place our work in the literature is by looking at the informality rate. The existing work has focused on the numerator (informal employment). Fernández and Meza (2015) reduce the labor market dynamics to the reallocation of labor between sectors, abstracting from flows to/from nonemployment. Finkelstein Shapiro (2018) gives a major role to unemployed workers engaging in self-employment during recessions. Our departure is guided by our finding that job creation from inactivity drives the bulk of movements in the employment rate (the denominator).====The paper is organized as follows (detailed discussion on some specific topics is available in the online appendix). In Section 2 we document the cyclical properties of the Mexican labor market. Next we build a model of business cycles for a small open economy, adding labor market frictions and informality, modeled as a self-employment option. The model is calibrated and compared to the data in Section 4 and its performance is then evaluated against some alternative explanations. In Section 6 we use the model to answer the two policy questions.

Long run efficient capacity allocation yields long run gravity, equivalent to the standard structural gravity model. The estimated short run ","Gravity models of trade fit cross sections of bilateral trade flows very well, but suggest puzzlingly stable bilateral resistance to trade. Coe et al. (2002) define the ‘Missing Globalization Puzzle’ as “the failure of declining trade-related costs to be reflected in estimates of the standard gravity model of bilateral trade” (p.1). Their reference to “declining trade-related costs” presumably means the big improvements in transportation and communications technology over the past 60 years. Disdier and Head (2008) focus on the secular invariance puzzle posed by non-declining distance elasticity estimates. Cyclic invariance of gravity estimates poses a related puzzle in light of the pronounced cyclic variation of shipping rates and delivery lags.====The short run gravity model and its application give an answer to the invariance puzzles. Trade costs rise with volume in the short run due to diminishing returns to a variable factor paired with a bilaterally specific fixed factor. Under plausible restrictions, log-linear gravity results as a static equilibrium structure, with bilateral costs that endogenously shift across destinations and over time. They also shift as bilateral capacities (marketing capital allocations) move over time. Time-invariance of estimated cross-section gravity elasticities arises because the standard gravity co-variates effectively control for time variation of the omitted bilateral capacity variables. The estimated model implies that reallocation of marketing capital toward cross-border trade increased world manufacturing trade 75% during the globalization period 1988–2006. Here is the missing globalization.====The structure of the model makes natural a new question – how far might globalization (defined as marketing capital reallocation) go? Long run efficient allocation is defined as the allocation such that no costless reallocation can raise capital income. Counterfactual long run equilibrium allocation of marketing capital implies world manufacturing real income gains of a bit less than 1% in 2006. Starting from earlier years, the gains generally decline from a bit over 2% in 1989, consistent with overall adjustment toward a long run target.====Short run gravity nests the standard (long run) gravity model where the long run is attained by the efficient allocation of marketing capital.

An interpretation of bilateral marketing capital is origin-destination-specific investment in bilateral links.==== ==== is the buyers' short run incidence elasticity, the fraction of a 1% rise in trade cost that is paid by buyers in short run equilibrium.==== ==== is a combination of the elasticity of substitution in demand and the elasticity of supply, itself micro-founded in the joint supply of output delivered to many destinations at increasing cost due to diminishing marginal product of a variable factor on each link. The model encompasses heterogeneous productivity, of industries (as in (Eaton and Kortum, 2002)) or of firms (as in (Chaney, 2008)). If ==== is at long run efficient levels for all bilateral trades (shares that perfectly match long run bilateral trade shares), short run gravity trade flows equal their long run gravity values.====The key conceptual object introduced in this paper is the micro-founded incidence elasticity parameter ==== ∈ (0,==== ====1) in (1). ==== is the proportion by which the short run trade elasticity is reduced from the long run trade elasticity. We seek an estimate of ==== from the movement of bilateral trade patterns over the era of globalization, 1988–2006, when traders everywhere plausibly increased efforts to find foreign counter-parties.====Inference of ==== requires disentangling the speed of adjustment of ==== from the effect of ==== changes on bilateral trade changes. Thus some dynamic structure is needed. There is no settled theory of trade link dynamics. Our approach combines two simple ad hoc dynamic devices with the short run gravity model. We lean heavily on structural gravity and associated regularities of geography while being agnostic about dynamic structure in our panel data. In contrast, Sampson (2016) develops and calibrates a technology flows structural dynamic gravity model, made feasible only by assuming uniform sized countries and uniform trade costs.====A reduced form dynamic approach to measuring the effect of globalization uses cross-border-time fixed effects with panel gravity data as controls. The estimated cross-border-time fixed effects turn out to move smoothly over time. In the context of the short run gravity model, this suggests that a single dynamic adjustment parameter ==== combines with ==== to fit the data. An external estimate of the adjustment parameter yields an estimate of ====. An alternative ==== structural dynamic device with a single adjustment parameter (explained below) infers the effect of globalization from lagged dependent variables, with standard treatments for endogeneity. The same external value of the speed of adjustment parameter ==== combined with the estimated structural model yields another estimate of ====. Using the results of the two estimation approaches simultaneously yields a third estimate of ==== along with speed of adjustment parameter ====.====The various estimates of ==== are reasonably close to each other and relatively insensitive to the methods of obtaining ====. This empirical success is presumably because the era of globalization is so dominated by smooth adjustment toward greater cross-border trade that any plausible dynamic model with a constant rate of adjustment comes close to the trade data. Concerns about the ==== dynamic devices are thus mitigated. Our estimation procedures locate the key structural parameter ==== ∈ (0.194,0.417), with a preferred value 0.27. In all robustness checks ==== is significantly far below 1, statistically and economically. The consistency of results on ==== and the goodness of fit indicate that a parametric incidence elasticity comes close to the data. Beyond the present paper the results suggest the usefulness of short run gravity in modeling bilateral trade even in eras where dynamic adjustment may be more complex.====Application of the model to manufacturing trade data for 52 countries yields a good fit with intuitively plausible parameters. Our reduced form specification finds highly significant declining cross-border-time effects associated with rising investment in cross-border capacities relative to domestic capacities.==== Globalization, interpreted as growing cross-border trade capacity, increased trade volume by 75%, the headline number noted above. Treating trade to and from China separately implies that globalization raised cross-border trade with China by 400%. The separate China treatment has no statistically significant effect on estimates of the cross-border-time trade effect of globalization on non-China pairs of partners (the point estimate falls from 75% to 69%). In contrast, the benchmark standard panel model of cross-section gravity regressions reproduces time invariant coefficients of trade cost proxies. Interpreted in the lens of the short run model, invariance arises because changes in bilateral capacities are proxied well by the standard origin and destination fixed effects along with bilateral iceberg trade cost controls. Essentially, the missing globalization hides in the exporter-time fixed effects.====The focus of the paper on globalization as marketing capital reallocation naturally leads to the question of how far globalization can go. The answer uses the estimates of ====, ==== and the other gravity parameters to quantify the potential real income gain from the long run allocation of marketing capital – the efficient allocation absent adjustment costs. The short run static equilibrium is compared to the long run counterfactual static equilibrium in 2006 holding constant the 2006 endowments, preferences, trade costs and parameters and reallocating marketing capital in each origin such that returns are equalized across destinations. Gains from long run globalization are significant but become relatively small toward the end of the globalization era: world real manufacturing income gains range from 2.15% in 1989 to 0.57% in 2006. The trend suggests movement toward long run allocation, consistent with the era of globalization. Also consistent with the reallocation story, the shortfall of cross-border marketing capital ==== following major liberalization events in the mid-90s (the WTO, NAFTA and the eastward expansion of the EU) and 2000 (the permanent WTO accession of China). In the lens of the model, the ‘permanent’ implementation increases the gap between current cross-border marketing capital allocation and its counterfactual long run allocation in 2006.====Our results also contribute to the literature on measuring trade elasticities. Short run gravity, given by (1), generates a simple prediction about the relationship between short run (====) and long run (====) gravity elasticities denoted ====:====where ==== denotes any bilateral gravity covariate. Cross-section gravity elasticity estimates are usually interpreted as long run elasticities.==== For the tariff factor covariate, ==== is the long run trade elasticity. Cross-section (i.e. long run) trade elasticity estimates usually range between 4 and 12. Our estimates of ==== are around 1/4 and suggest a range for short run trade elasticities between 1 and 3.====Eq. (2) is a time-invariant relationship between short run and long run trade elasticities. The related macro literature in contrast links short run time-varying to static long run elasticities. Ruhl (2008) reconciles the difference between short run and long run elasticities in a model based on cyclical fluctuations being temporary whereas trade cost changes are permanent. Arkolakis et al. (2011) offer an explanation capable of handling the many country gravity context. A fraction of boundedly rational (myopic) consumers switch to cheaper suppliers at each point in time. In contrast, our model assumes perfectly efficient spatial equilibrium given the marketing capital allocation.====Closest to our model, Crucini and Davis (2016) explain the discrepancy between the short run and long run elasticities with distribution capital that is specific to the origin of the good, domestic or foreign. They calibrate a two country real business cycle model to moments of price dispersion data for 6 sectors in 13 US cities. In comparison to our model, theirs allows for CES production of distribution services whereas ours restricts the elasticity of substitution to 1 (i.e., Cobb-Douglas). Our simplification buys time-invariance of the short run trade elasticity, so we can identify parameters off the variation of multi-country bilateral trade over time using structural gravity estimation. From a broader perspective, as we demonstrate in Section 3, our short run gravity model belongs to the wide class of models described in Arkolakis et al. (2012). Thus short run gravity opens a way to introduce short run adjustment considerations to current practice in general equilibrium trade policy simulation analysis. The experiments that we offer in Section 4.4 offer two specific examples.====Section 2 presents the basic theoretical model of joint trade costs of production and delivery to many destinations. Section 3 applies the model to the multi-country setting, yielding the short run gravity model. Section 4 develops and tests two complementary empirical versions of the model. Supplemental online Appendix A shows that the basic model encompasses heterogeneous productivities (as in (Eaton and Kortum, 2002)) and heterogeneous firms (as in (Chaney, 2008)).

Using rich firm-level data, we document a comprehensive set of facts on entry, exit, and growth of new exporters and new MNEs. Guided by these facts, we build a model based on the standard proximity-concentration trade-off extended to incorporate time-varying firm productivity and sunk costs of MNE entry. The calibrated version of the model goes far in matching cross-sectional and dynamic moments of the data on exporters and MNEs. Our results point to much higher sunk costs for MNE than for export activities. Finally, we show how including the choice to become an MNE affects the predicted export dynamics after a trade liberalization episode.","Exporters' life-cycle dynamics are important to understand the long- and short-term effects of economic shocks and trade policy changes. In consequence, they have been extensively studied. However, exporting is only one possible option for firms to serve a foreign market. Firms may also choose to become multinational enterprises (henceforth, MNEs). Despite the overwhelming importance of these firms in the data, we know comparatively little about the life-cycle dynamics of MNEs and their possible interaction with exporter dynamics.====This paper studies the life-cycle dynamics of exporters and MNEs. We exploit data on domestic firms, exporters, and MNEs from France and Norway and complement them with data on MNEs from Germany. Using these rich firm-level data, we first provide a comprehensive set of facts on the life-cycle dynamics of new exporters and new MNEs. First, the exit rates of new exporters in a foreign market are two to three times higher than those of new affiliates of MNEs in the same market. Second, conditional on survival in the market, average sales growth is similar for new exporters and new MNEs. However, the export growth profiles of exporters that switch to serving the market as MNEs are steeper than those of exporters that do not switch to MNE status. Finally, the exit rates of exporters at age one exhibit gravity—they are strongly correlated negatively with foreign market size and positively with distance—whereas those of young MNE affiliates are uncorrelated with these foreign country characteristics. In contrast, entry rates do not present stark differences in their gravity patterns between the two groups. Our findings are strikingly very similar across the three economies under study, despite their different size and structure.====Guided by the facts, we develop a dynamic model of trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) based on the static model of the proximity-concentration trade-off in Helpman et al. (2004, henceforth, HMY). We introduce dynamics into the model by assuming that firm productivity evolves according to a Markov process and that MNE activities face a sunk entry cost. The model preserves the ranking of the export and MNE choice from the static model: the most productive firms become MNEs; firms with intermediate productivity levels become exporters; and the least productive firms serve only their home market. The sunk costs of MNE activities lead to a band of inaction, a range of productivity levels where existing MNEs do not exit a market, but non-MNEs with the same productivity do not enter. We show that the model is rich enough to ==== capture the facts we document.====In the calibrated version of the model, we incorporate sunk export costs and assume that fixed and sunk costs for both MNE and export activities are heterogeneous at the firm-destination level. We evaluate the ==== fit of this model where HMY is coupled with dynamics features of Roberts and Tybout (1997). Although we do not target the exit and growth profiles of new exporters and new MNEs, nor the transition probabilities between domestic, exporter, and MNE status, the calibrated model captures the patterns observed in the data fairly well.====Our calibration shows that sunk MNE costs are much higher than sunk export costs: conditional on entry, the average sunk MNE cost across destinations represents 21.4% of the median French MNE's affiliate annual sales, while the average sunk export cost across destinations is less than 1% of the median exporter's annual sales to a destination. Similarly for Norway, conditional on entry, the average sunk MNE cost across destinations represents 26.8% of the median Norwegian MNE annual affiliate sales, with a very small estimated sunk export cost per destination. Across destinations, the average fixed cost for an affiliate represents about 10% of the median Norwegian MNE affiliate sales, whereas the annual fixed export cost represents around 15% of the median Norwegian annual export sales to a destination. The median affiliate sales, however, are two orders of magnitude larger than the median export sales.====We evaluate the predictions of our calibrated model after a hypothetical trade-liberalization episode. We compare the predictions of our model with both exporters and MNEs to a calibrated version of the model with only exporters. Enriching the canonical dynamic model of trade to include MNEs—a first-order feature of the data—has consequences for the behavior of exporters. The main source of the different responses of exporters between the two models hinges on the right truncation induced by the inclusion of the MNE choice. Without the MNE choice, the most productive firms are exporters, as in the static model in Melitz (2003); with the MNE choice, the most productive firms become MNEs, as in HMY. In a dynamic setup, including the MNE choice not only truncates the exporters' distribution of productivity levels but also induces a higher exit likelihood for the most productive exporters, along with a truncation to the right of the distribution of growth rates. The fastest-growing exporters exit exporting and become MNEs when that option is allowed, whereas the slowest-growing exporters remain exporters. Those exporters with the highest productivity growth do not contribute to the average growth rate of exporters in the model with MNEs—because they change status—but they do so in the model in which the MNE option is not included.==== While we find significant quantitative differences in the aggregate response of exporters to a trade-liberalization shock, we find only moderate differences in the life-cycle growth profiles of exporters between the models with and without MNEs.====Our paper contributes to several strands of the literature. First, we contribute to the small but growing literature that studies the joint behavior of exporters and MNEs using dynamic models. Ramondo et al. (2013), Fillat and Garetto (2015), and Conconi et al. (2016), among others, document and study different implications of the proximity-concentration trade-off in dynamic setups. We present new evidence and study implications related to the joint life-cycle behavior of exporters and MNEs.====Second, we complement the extensive literature that studies exporters' dynamics. Early work by Baldwin (1989), Baldwin and Krugman (1989), and Dixit (1989), followed by Roberts and Tybout (1997), Ghironi and Melitz (2005), Das et al. (2007), Alessandria and Choi (2007), and Impullitti et al. (2013), point to the importance of the hysteresis created by sunk investments for understanding the effects of temporary and permanent shocks on aggregate trade flows and exchange rate movements. Our model combines elements of this rich dynamic literature on exporters with the canonical model of trade and FDI in HMY.====Our paper is closely related to Ruhl and Willis (2017), who document a set of life-cycle dynamics facts for Colombian exporters. We document a similar set of facts for new French and Norwegian exporters but also include facts for new MNEs. We find, as they do, that matching the observed patterns of survival and growth of new exporters requires very low sunk export costs, but this is not the case for MNEs. While they expand the canonical export model to include demand-side frictions, we include MNEs, a first-order feature of the data. We evaluate how far the model with MNEs goes in matching the data and whether the presence of MNEs changes the dynamic behavior of new exporters.====The paper proceeds as follows.

While the seminal contribution by Dornbusch provides concise predictions—exchange rates appreciate, i.e., overshoot on impact before depreciating gradually—empirical support for his hypothesis is at best mixed. I argue that the failure to discover overshooting may result from assumptions researchers have imposed to recover structural VARs. Specifically, simultaneous feedback effects between ==== and exchange rates, which are inherently forward-looking variables, are often excluded or modeled alongside with strong restrictions. In this paper, I identify U.S. monetary policy shocks using surprises in Federal funds futures around policy announcements as external instruments, which recent literature has established to represent the appropriate laboratory in settings encompassing ==== and financial variables. Resulting adjustments of the dollar, conditional on shifts in policy, generally align with Dornbusch's predictions during the post-Bretton-Woods era, including Volcker's tenure as Fed Chair.","What is the transmission mechanism of a monetary policy tightening in the open economy? In a nutshell, the answer to this question by Dornbusch (1976) reads as follows: (i) the central bank brings about a surprise hike of interest rates; by doing so, (ii) a positive interest differential relative to other countries arises, (iii) inducing exchange rates to appreciate instantaneously, followed by (iv) gradual depreciation. Building on a combination of uncovered interest parity, purchasing-power parity, and liquidity effects, the so-called ==== hypothesis ranges among the most important concepts in the history of international economics and finance (see Rogoff, 2002).==== Paying tribute to Dornbusch's hypothesis, the literature has termed any empirical failure to discover overshooting in reference to his concept. Roughly speaking, departures are documented along three dimensions: qualitatively (====), quantitatively (====), and in terms of timing (====). Using a Vector autoregressive (VAR) model that is identified by external instruments, I provide fresh causal evidence for U.S. monetary policy shocks during the post-Bretton-Woods era that aligns with Dornbusch (1976), along all three dimensions.====Since its first formulation, which closely coincides with the transition of several industrialized countries from fixed to flexible exchange rate regimes, Dornbusch's theory has been put to empirical tests largely within the VAR framework ever since.==== While VARs have been shown to summarize and forecast macroeconomic and financial data quite well, drawing structural inference from them to make an economic interpretation feasible, requires further restrictions. By using different assumptions to solve the identification challenge, researchers have produced rather mixed results when it comes to the vital question on how monetary policy impacts exchange rates.====A large body of existing empirical contributions, initiated by Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), recovers the structural form of VARs by translating reduced form residuals into orthogonal innovations via a recursive scheme. The economic reasoning for this strategy is the perception that macroeconomic variables display a contemporaneous zero-elasticity with respect to the policy instrument. Within the recursive setting, another restriction needs to be imposed: either the policy rate does not simultaneously affect exchange rates or it is not allowed to respond to the latter, on impact. As exchange rates are inherently-forward looking time-series that are determined in flexible and highly-liquid markets, modeling their interplay with interest rates in such a way appears to be controversial. The so-identified shocks are in essence a mixture of policy shocks and endogenous responses to, e.g., exchange rates. As an appealing alternative to allow for a meaningful contemporaneous interplay between exchange rates and interest rates, several studies abandon zero-restrictions by replacing them with sign-restrictions on impulse response functions that identify their VARs (see Faust and Rogers, 2003; Scholl and Uhlig, 2008). Albeit relaxing the simultaneous link of financial variables in VARs, sign-restrictions approaches need to resort to otherwise sharp assumptions about the qualitative repercussions of monetary policy shocks. Another strand of research uses high-frequency financial markets data to study the effects of monetary policy actions, measured as surprise components in asset prices (see Kuttner, 2001; Gürkaynak et al., 2005). These event studies typically document large ==== repercussions of monetary policy on financial variables such as exchange rates (e.g., Glick and Leduc, 2018). Overall, these high-frequency approaches are often silent on the ramifications of shocks over time, which are at the heart of the overshooting hypothesis.====In this study, I combine the advantages of high-frequency and VAR approaches, as in Gertler and Karadi (2015), by using the external instruments augmented VAR (SVAR-IV) framework of Stock and Watson (2012) and Mertens and Ravn (2013) to identify exogenous shifts in monetary policy and to track their causal effect on foreign exchange rates. My focus rests on the identification of ==== monetary policy shocks during “normal” times, which is also the object of investigation in Dornbusch (1976).==== I employ financial markets data as “proxies” for U.S. monetary policy innovations, which I measure as Federal funds futures surprises observed around Fed announcements. Contrasting the narrative identification approach of, e.g., Romer and Romer (2004), the SVAR-IV model perceives the instrument as a noisy signal of the true underlying shock and thus accounts for measurement error. Contrasting the zero- and sign-restricted identification schemes, information about shocks is directly derived from forecasts of market participants who rely on a plethora of sources to form expectations. Conditional on the instrument-selection, the SVAR-IV model does not necessitate assumptions about the structural form, i.e., the identifying restrictions are data-determined. Importantly, this strategy ====. To draw inference, I rely on recent progress of Montiel Olea et al. (2018) to calculate asymptotically valid confidence sets and to test the strength of the instrument, which turns out to be “strong”.====As a benchmark, I estimate a VAR for the U.S. economy at the monthly frequency; the sample period starts with Volcker's tenure as Fed Chair in July 1979 and ends before the onset of the zero-lower-bound episode in September 2008. Identified via Federal funds futures surprises, a 25 basis point policy tightening delivers overall adjustment patterns, consistent with studies employing similar methods. Most notably, for a basket of the ten largest trade partners of the U.S., nominal exchange rates significantly appreciate on impact and reach their maximum reaction of 1% in the second month after the shock, before gradually depreciating. Forecast error variance decompositions further reveal that, quantitatively, most interactions between exogenous shifts in monetary policy and endogenous exchange rate reactions occur swiftly after policy innovations hit the economy. Consistent with the prevalence of overshooting, I document that UIP generally appears to hold as well, in a conditional sense; that is, excess returns of investors engaging in trading strategies against the UIP condition are statistically not different from zero. These results for the U.S. align with Bjørnland (2009), who reports consistent evidence for monetary policy surprises in ====. Using zero- and long-run restrictions that identify her ==== VAR model, however, she maintains the recursiveness assumption for macroeconomic aggregates and restricts any contemporaneous feedback from foreign interest rates to zero.==== By contrast, my identification strategy gives rise to meaningful simultaneous interactions among all time-series in the VAR and likewise establishes immediate overshooting dynamics.====I provide complementary empirical evidence for different post-Bretton-Woods samples and uncover the following findings. First, the causal evidence on exchange rate overshooting extends to the era surrounding the Great Recession and persists when explicitly accounting for forward guidance policies of the Fed. Second, when exploring conditional dynamics by isolating, both, the period of Volcker's tenure as Fed chair and the post-Volcker era, I arrive at similar inference. Remarkably, the finding of virtually non-delayed overshooting—unearthed ==== for post-Bretton-Woods data—also prevails during both subsamples.==== By contrast, Scholl and Uhlig (2008) report substantially ==== exchange rate overshooting for post-Bretton-Woods data by imposing sign-restrictions to recover their VAR's structural form. Kim et al. (2017) revisit their influential findings and stress that the inclusion of data capturing Volcker's tenure may underlie the delayed exchange rate reaction. My causal evidence derived from SVAR-IVs, however, suggests that U.S. data may be in favor of immediate overshooting, both, when pooling data throughout the post-Bretton-Woods episode and when differentiating between monetary policy regimes.====Ultimately, the existence of virtually non-delayed overshooting of exchange rates further emerges in the SVAR-IV system for: (i) several bilateral exchange rates, (ii) even broader exchange rate baskets capturing up to 27 economies, (iii) different weighting schemes used to construct exchange rate indices, (iv) real exchange rates, and (v) proxies that are purged from central bank information shocks. My results also withstand a battery of other robustness checks involving the inclusion of additional time-series in the VAR, such as monetary aggregates, or the performance of other changes to the model's specification. In addition, formal comparisons with competing sign- and zero-restricted identification schemes applied to my reduced-form VAR uncover that beyond producing delayed exchange rate overshooting or other exchange rate anomalies, these approaches typically come with some output “puzzle”; that is, economic activity expands at short horizons conditional on a policy tightening. Moreover, both strategies predict a rather protracted tightening of financial conditions, as proxied by the excess bond premium of Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012). The SVAR-IV approach, by contrast, reveals the strongest shock procession of such a financial tensions series on impact, while generating no unintuitive expansion in aggregate activity (see Gertler and Karadi, 2015).====The remainder of the paper is as follows: Section 2 outlines the empirical strategy, Section 3 presents the main findings, Section 4 discusses extensions of the model, Section 5 scrutinizes the findings along several dimensions, and Section 6 concludes.","Shifts in monetary policy and exchange rate dynamics: Is Dornbusch's overshooting hypothesis intact, after all?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219962030060X,16 May 2020,2020,Research Article,170.0

Using a two-country, two-currency search model, we study two types of government interventions: (1) legal restrictions impacting a seller's ability to accept a foreign currency, and (2) reductions to the cost a seller must pay to accept a foreign currency. The first intervention can be viewed as a way to capture a decrease in ====, while the second can be viewed as a way to explore the impact of reducing information costs associated with using a foreign currency. Our results indicate that abolishing legal restrictions that impact a seller's ability to accept a foreign currency can increase both quantities traded and the number of trades involving two types of currencies. Additionally, the international status of currencies is significantly enhanced when sellers face very low foreign currency acceptance costs.","Historically, government agencies have adopted a wide range of policies to achieve various monetary goals. These goals have included stabilizing the value of a domestic currency, introducing a new currency, or promoting a currency's domestic circulation or its international status (see discussions in Wallace (1983), Li and Wright (1998), Craig and Waller (2000), Camera et al. (2004), Craig and Waller (2004) and Goldberg (2012)). For example, in the 1990s, the Ukrainian government employed a combination of policies that decreased the cost of adopting the domestic currency as a medium of exchange while increasing the cost of accepting U.S. dollars. These policies helped introduce a new domestic currency and reduce the dollarization of the Ukrainian economy (see Craig and Waller (2000) for more details). China has also been actively promoting the international status of renminbi by imposing or lifting various restrictions on currency utilization (e.g., Park (2016)). More recently, the emergence of cryptocurrencies has attracted renewed attention to issues associated with currency competition. Ultimately, whether such policies succeed in affecting the targeted economic outcomes as intended, depends on the decisions of private citizens and firms living in the countries potentially impacted by the policy of interest.====The aforementioned policies, and other comparable policies, provide some of the motivation behind this paper. However, our primary goal is not to provide policy lessons. Instead, we aim to better understand factors that facilitate or hinder coordination around the use of multiple currencies. To this end, our study integrates monetary theory and experiments to explore how government interventions affect economic allocations and the international status of a currency. More specifically, the theory and experimental setting are designed to address the following questions: How is the value of a foreign currency determined by individuals trading in the laboratory market setting? How do policies that affect the legality and the cost of accepting a foreign currency impact trade patterns and the adoption of these currencies?====The model used for examining currency exchange is based on the search-theoretic approach proposed by Lagos and Wright (2005) and Zhang (2014). One advantage of this approach is that it is micro-founded, i.e., explicit about features that give endogenous value to fiat moneys. In the model provided by Zhang (2014), transaction patterns are endogenous, so it is possible to determine in equilibrium which currencies are adopted and at which prices. Thus, it is possible to study how government policies may affect currency acceptance decisions of private citizens and currencies' circulation patterns. Because the model is micro-founded, it is also amenable to laboratory implementation (see also Duffy and Puzzello, 2014a, Duffy and Puzzello, 2014b, Jiang and Zhang (2018), or Rietz (2019))). Another advantage of this model is that it provides a tractable framework, despite the assumption of divisible currencies and goods, as it builds on the model originally proposed by Lagos and Wright (2005). As a result, this framework allows one to evaluate the impact of government policies on both the extensive and intensive trade margins, and thus provide a more accurate assessment of these policies.====The empirical literature on currency competition is limited, in part due to the lack of micro-level data. Another reason is that field data faces causal identification challenges (e.g., Colacelli and Blackburn (2009)). The experimental approach allows us to have greater control over the decision-making environment, to isolate factors affecting the decision to accept a particular currency, and to make direct observations about trading behavior. That is, we view the experimental method as a complementary tool to other empirical methods, and we use it to obtain insights that are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain using field data (see Smith (1994) for reasons to conduct experiments or Duffy (2016) for arguments in support of experimental methods in international economics and macroeconomics). For example, we focus on an environment with trading complementarities, e.g., an environment in which the currency sellers accept depends on the currency buyers carry, and vice versa. Such complementarities give rise to coordination issues with multiple equilibria. The laboratory setting can provide useful insights on factors affecting equilibrium selection.====In the search-theoretic model used in this paper, there are two countries with different population sizes, which include buyers and sellers.==== In each period, agents trade in a decentralized market and a centralized market. Interactions in the decentralized market generate gains from trade, while the centralized market allows agents to rebalance their money holdings. In the decentralized market, sellers choose which currency to accept, before being randomly paired with a domestic or foreign buyer. There is an information cost for accepting foreign currency, which could correspond, e.g., to the costs associated with installing verification technologies or dealing with foreign exchange traders.====The international status of currencies is determined endogenously by sellers' decisions. Sellers in both countries decide whether to accept a particular foreign currency as payment. A currency is deemed “international” if it is accepted by sellers in both countries, while it is “national” if it is accepted only by domestic sellers. In the centralized market, a general good is traded in terms of both currencies. In this setting, government interventions (such as legal restrictions that allow only the use of the domestic currency in the decentralized market, or a change in the cost that sellers must pay to accept the foreign currency) can affect currency acceptance decisions and international status.====To examine how currency interventions affect market allocations, the laboratory market setting includes the examination of four treatment conditions. In the Baseline treatment, a subset of sellers in both countries can only accept the domestic currency. This treatment is designed to capture legal restrictions (see also Wallace (1983)). Unconstrained sellers can choose to accept foreign currency, but incur a cost for doing so. The Baseline treatment allows two monetary equilibria that depend on the agents' beliefs: one in which one currency is domestic and the other currency is international, and one in which both currencies are international.==== In the NoRestriction treatment, sellers in both countries are allowed to choose which currency to adopt as well as whether to accept both currencies. This treatment corresponds to a laissez-faire regime characterized by free trade, no capital controls and market-determined exchange rates (see Kareken and Wallace (1981) and Arifovic (1996)). This treatment allows only one equilibrium, where both currencies are international. In the LowCost and VeryLowCost treatments, the cost of accepting foreign currency is decreased to progressively lower levels. These treatments also allow only one equilibrium in which both currencies are international.====Overall, we find evidence in support of a currency regime shift only when foreign currency acceptance costs are sufficiently low. Indeed, when those costs are very low, the acceptance and usage of foreign currencies increase significantly. While we do not find strong evidence that legal restrictions are successful in determining a regime shift, it is evident that economic allocations are affected by legal restrictions. Specifically, traded quantities and trade proposals involving both types of currencies are significantly larger in the NoRestriction treatment than in the Baseline treatment. In sum, legal restrictions have an impact on the intensive and extensive margins, and thus affect economic allocations. Still, to boost the international status of a currency, sellers must face a considerably low foreign-currency acceptance cost. Section 2 summarizes related literature and our contribution to the literature. Sections 3 describes the model environment. Section 4 provides details of the experimental design and procedures, while Section 5 presents the experimental results. Section 6 discusses why we did not observe strong evidence in support of a currency regime shift in the NoRestriction and LowCost treatments.

Other policy reforms such as the elimination of U.S. quotas under the Multifibre Agreements and of Chinese export controls also reduced prices.","China's manufacturing export growth in the last 20 years has produced a dramatic realignment of world trade, with China emerging as the world's largest exporter. China's export growth was especially rapid following its World Trade Organization (WTO) entry in 2001, with the 2001–2006 growth rate of 30% per annum being more than double the growth rate in the previous five years. This growth has been so spectacular that it has attracted increasing attention to the negative effects of the China “trade shock” on other countries, such as employment and wage losses in import-competing U.S. manufacturing industries (Autor et al. (2013), Acemoglu et al. (2016), and Pierce and Schott (2016)). Surprisingly, given the traditional focus of international trade theory, little analysis has been made of the potential gains to consumers of products, whether households or firms, in the rest of the world, who could benefit from access to cheaper Chinese imports and more imported varieties. Our focus is on potential benefits to consumers in the U.S., where China accounts for more than 20% of imports. In principle, gains could be driven by two distinct policy changes that occurred with China's WTO entry. The first, which has received much attention in the literature, is the U.S. granting permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to China, reducing the threat of China facing very high tariffs on its exports to the U.S. A second channel we identify is China reducing its own input tariffs. In this paper, we quantify how China's WTO entry affected the prices of U.S., Chinese and other countries' firms selling manufactured goods in the U.S. market, and we find that an important cause of these effects was China lowering its own tariffs on intermediate inputs.====To motivate our analysis, in Fig. 1 we plot Chinese exports to the U.S. in industries above and below the median input tariff cut of 4.6 percentage points. With exports of both bins indexed at 100 in 2001, we see substantially faster export growth in industries with larger reductions in their input tariffs. To understand where this faster growth might be coming from, in Table 1 we report a regression of the log-change in HS 6-digit unit values of China's exports to the U.S. between 2000 and 2006 on the corresponding change in Chinese input tariffs for that industry. Column 1 reports a simple OLS regression, and shows that Chinese input tariff reductions are strongly associated with reductions in their export prices. In column 2 we employ a simple IV regression strategy from Goldberg and Pavcnik (2005), exploiting the fact that the size of the tariff reduction is primarily determined by the pre-existing tariff level, so that the pre-existing input tariff is a valid instrument for the change in that tariff. The association between the fall in input tariffs and in export prices is slightly stronger in the IV results, with a coefficient on the change in the input tariff rising from 3.6 to 3.9.====The goal of this paper is to exploit detailed firm-level Chinese data to analyze the results illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Specifically, we are interested in the impact of China's export growth following its WTO accession on U.S. prices. To measure China's impact, we utilize Chinese firm-product-destination level export data for the years 2000 to 2006, during which China's exports to the U.S. increased nearly four-fold. One striking feature is that the extensive margin of China's U.S. exports accounts for 84% of export growth, mostly due to new firms entering the export market (69% of total growth) rather than incumbents exporting new products (15% of total growth).==== To ensure we properly incorporate new varieties in measuring price indexes, we construct an exact CES price index, as in Feenstra (1994) which comprises a “price” and a “variety” component.==== We supplement the Chinese data with U.S. reported trade data for imports from other foreign countries and U.S. domestic sales data to construct overall U.S. price indexes for manufacturing industries. With these data, we explicitly take into account that the China shock affects competitors' prices and net entry into the U.S. market.====We find that China's WTO entry reduced U.S. manufacturing industry price indexes in the median industry by 8.0% between 2000 and 2006, relative to an industry that was not directly exposed to trade reforms. That effect comes from lower effective prices for Chinese exports, and from a substantial reduction in the prices of other countries selling to the U.S., too. The biggest contribution to the overall price reduction comes from lower inputs tariffs in China, while a large contribution also comes from the reduction in tariff uncertainty. Other policy reforms such as the elimination of U.S. quotas under the Multifibre Agreement (MFA) and of Chinese export controls had added impacts on reducing prices. We conclude that the lowering of China's own input tariffs and the granting of PNTR were important sources of price declines in the United States. Other trade policy reforms helped to push down prices further.====Our paper draws on several lines of literature. Pierce and Schott (2016), Handley and Limão (2017) and Feng et al. (2017) study the effect of granting PNTR to China, but they do not study the input tariff reduction channel.==== A second literature finds that lower input tariffs increase firms' total factor productivity (e.g., Amiti and Konings (2007) for Indonesia; Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008) for Chile; Goldberg et al. (2010) for India; Halpern et al. (2015) for Hungary; Yu (2015) and Brandt et al. (2017) for China) and therefore lower prices. While we are guided by that literature, we do not estimate the impact of lower input tariffs on productivity since our main interest is in the impact on Chinese exporters' prices abroad.==== Rather, we will examine the impact of China's reduction in its own imported input tariffs and its WTO entry on the prices of Chinese exporters to the U.S. and the effect on other prices in that market.====A limitation of our study is that we consider only the direct benefits to the firms and households purchasing imports, and the competitive effect on U.S. prices, but we do not attempt to trace these price effects through an input-output table and into the labor market, as would be needed to evaluate the overall welfare gains to the U.S. from China's WTO entry. That broader question requires a computable model. For example, Hsieh and Ossa (2016) calibrate a multi-country model with aggregate industry data at the two-digit level, and find that China transmits small gains to the rest of the world.==== More recently, Caliendo et al. (2019) combine a model of heterogeneous firms with a dynamic labor search model. Calibrating this to the United States, they find that China's export growth created a loss of about 550,000 manufacturing jobs, but still increased aggregate U.S. welfare by 0.2% in the long-run. Both of these papers rely on the assumption of the Arkolakis et al. (2012) (ACR) framework of a Pareto distribution for firm productivities. In contrast, our approach does not rely on a particular distribution of productivities, and also differs from ACR in that we focus on the channels through which trade policy changes in one country (China) lead to consumer gains in another (the United States).====Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our key assumptions about U.S. consumers and presents a simple model of Chinese exporting firms. Section 3 discusses the data on Chinese exports to the U.S. and the tariffs faced by those firms, as well as data used for other countries selling in the U.S. An obvious problem with the data used in Table 1 is that the prices are in fact ==== for China's exports to the United States in each HS6 category. Those unit values could be falling due to the reduction in Chinese tariffs on imported inputs if new exporters are selling lower-priced (and possibly lower-quality) goods, thereby pulling down the unit values. To correct for this limitation, the data that we shall use for Chinese export prices to the United States comes from firm-level prices of those Chinese firms, which allows us to exclude the prices of new firms that begin exporting. We will incorporate those new firms, however, by constructing measures of Chinese import variety into the United States that reflect those new Chinese exporters, as described in section 3.1. We will incorporate that measure of Chinese import variety into the “effective prices” faced by U.S. consumers. For U.S. purchases from countries ==== China, i.e. purchases from domestic U.S. firms and from other countries' exporters, we will not have the same level of detail as for the Chinese firms, but we will still attempt to construct measures of product variety in addition to the product prices from these countries.====Section 4 constructs overall U.S. manufacturing industry price indexes for China and other countries, and estimates the impact of China's WTO accession and its own lowering of tariffs on imported inputs on U.S. prices. There we find the reduction in U.S. industry price indexes by a median value of 8.0% between 2000 and 2006, with greater reductions for intermediate inputs than for final goods. We check the robustness of our results to other policy reforms and to industry controls. It is not just the average reduction in prices that we are interested in, of course, but also the variation in those price reductions across industries. We show that the cross-industry variation in price reductions has explanatory power for the change in the Chinese import share within U.S. consumption, and for the change in U.S. industry employment.

Using Italian loan-level data, we show that the shock to the banks' sovereign portfolio caused by the 2010 Greek ==== was passed on to Italian firms through a credit contraction. This was particularly the case for banks with a lower capital and less stable funding. The contraction in credit was similar for both large and small firms, but it only negatively affected the investment and employment decisions of small firms.","Financial intermediaries play a fundamental role in enhancing economic growth, lending to firms and households and reallocating capital to the highest-value use (Schumpeter, 1934; King and Levine, 1993). But loans are not the only assets held by banks. A large fraction of their portfolio is composed of securities, real properties, and equity holdings. While there are complementarities among these different investments, swings in the market price and riskiness of these assets may lead to adjustments in banks' credit supply, with potential adverse effects on the real economy.====This paper studies the role played by banks' security portfolio on the propagation of international macro-financial shocks to the real economy. We specifically focus on the role played by the bank's sovereign bonds - one of the most important security class held by financial intermediaries - during a period characterized by tensions in international sovereign markets. In particular, we analyze the credit market dynamics and firms' real economic activity in Italy around the 2010 Greek bailout event. The bailout directly concerned Greece and its investors, but it also sparked a widespread turmoil in global financial markets, including the Italian sovereign bond market. We show that Italian financial intermediaries with large exposures to government securities tightened their credit supply after the burst of the Greek sovereign crisis when compared to less exposed banks, and that the credit contraction negatively affected the investment and employment choices of the Italian SME corporate sector.====The Greek bailout is an ideal setting to study the role played by banks' security portfolios on the transmission of international shocks. First, we can examine the effects of financial contagion by focusing on one specific shock originating outside of the national borders that was not caused by a contemporaneous deterioration in economic fundamentals or political risk. As we discuss in the paper, the Greek events radically and unexpectedly changed the risk perception of government bonds issued by individual countries in Europe, including Italy. In fact, the sequence of events that culminated into Greece's bailout request was a “wake-up call” for investors, inducing an increase in the volatility of government bond yields in peripheral European countries and a widening of their spreads vis-a-vis the German Bund (Lane, 2012; Giordano et al., 2013).==== Second, the richness of our data allows us to assess the impact of the tensions in financial markets on credit supply, and then on real outcomes. Using administrative data, we analyze over 500,000 firm-bank credit relationships comparing the change in credit supply around the Greek bailout across banks differentially exposed to government bonds. Our data includes all Italian financial intermediaries and a large, representative sample of non-financial corporations operating in the time window around the first Greek bailout in April 2010.====To capture the exposure of financial institutions to the sovereign shock, we construct a bank-level proxy that exploits the cross-sectional heterogeneity in banks' holdings of Italian sovereigns measured before the Greek bailout (2010:Q1). The focus on pre-bailout holdings allows us to tackle concerns related to banks' endogenous portfolio adjustments that took place in response to the sovereign crisis itself and the unconventional measures adopted by the ECB to counteract the dysfunctions in sovereign markets (Broner et al., 2014; Acharya and Steffen, 2015). Furthermore, taking advantage of the widespread presence of firms with multiple relationships with different financial institutions, we run within-firm difference-in-difference regressions that compare changes in credit supply to the same borrower from lenders with different exposure to Italian government debt around the Greek bailout (2009:Q2–2011:Q1).==== This research design allows us to disentangle the effect of changes in credit supply from simultaneous changes in firms' credit demand and creditworthiness (Gan, 2007a, Gan, 2007b; Khwaja and Mian, 2008; Amiti and Weinstein, 2016).====We begin by documenting that the turmoil in the sovereign bond market had a negative, causal effect on bank lending due to banks' direct exposure of their security portfolio to the financial shock. When we compare lending to the same firm by two banks that are one standard deviation apart in terms of sovereign exposure, we find that the more exposed financial intermediary reduced its credit supply by 10% more relative to the less exposed. Not only did the more exposed banks cut lending more intensively, they were also more likely to break ongoing credit relationships or cut credit limits on lines of credit. The paper presents a number of robustness tests to support the causal interpretation of these results.====Investigating the channels of transmission of the financial shock to bank lending activity, we find that the tightening in credit supply is larger for poorly capitalized banks and intermediaries relying more heavily on interbank debt as a source of funding. This suggests that the sovereign shock affected lending because it unexpectedly increased the riskiness of bank assets, forcing financial intermediaries to adjust their behavior. Sovereign securities, considered to be almost riskless before the Greek bailout, started carrying a nontrivial amount of credit risk after spring 2010. As a result, banks concerned with the need to increase their capitalization or to raise funding preemptively tightened credit supply in order to adjust the riskiness of their assets (Peek and Rosengren, 1997, Peek and Rosengren, 2000). Furthermore, the turmoil in the government bond market also impaired banks' operations by reducing the collateral value of sovereigns (Abbassi et al., 2014), which are used extensively to back up collateralized interbank lending transactions. As in the case of the recent financial crisis (Ivashina and Scharfstein 2010; Cingano et al., 2016), intermediaries' exposure to wholesale markets appears to be a catalyst for the transmission of the shock.====The contraction of credit supply by banks more exposed to sovereign securities led to an overall reduction of firms' access to bank financing. In fact, lenders' exposure at the onset of the sovereign crisis is highly predictive of the change in a firm's ==== bank credit spanning the burst of the sovereign crisis. A one standard deviation increase in lenders' average holdings of Italian sovereign securities before the sovereign shock corresponds to a reduction of 5% in the firm's total bank borrowing, compared to its pre-crisis amount. This suggests that because of credit-market imperfections, firms were unable to compensate for the reduction in credit from more exposed lenders by expanding their borrowing from less exposed financial intermediaries. Conducting a simple counterfactual exercise, our estimates suggest that the lending channel caused by banks' direct exposure to securities affected by the sovereign shock (i.e. the ====) can account for a drop of almost 2% in aggregate lending during our period of analysis. Furthermore, we show that while credit declined for both large and small companies, the overall effect on smaller enterprises was substantially larger.====Finally, we document the transmission of the financial shock to the real economy. We find that the Greek bailout - through its effect on banks' lending - negatively affected firms' investment and employment policies. This effect is fully driven by small companies, which cut investments and payroll costs more than other equally exposed large firms. In particular, we estimate that one euro cut in funding to small firms decreased investments by 38 cent and payroll payments by 37 cent. At the same time, we find essentially no effect for larger firms. Importantly, we note that this result is not driven by a differentially credit tightening across large and small firms, but rather by relative inability of smaller businesses to smooth a similar credit shock across different lenders.====This work provides new evidence of the real economic costs of a banking system encumbered with government debt.==== Other studies explored the effects of the recent European sovereign crisis using data on large banks and large firms active in the syndicated loan market (Popov and Van Horen, 2013; De Marco, 2019; Acharya et al., 2018).==== The granularity of our data allows us to improve upon the existing literature in terms of both internal and external validity. First, our estimation window is centered around the first event that triggered the European sovereign crisis, allowing us to examine the effect of an increase in sovereign risk in a period when a contemporaneous deterioration in local economic fundamentals, political risk, or banks' strategic adjustments are unlikely to be important confounding factors. Moreover, by combining loan-level data from the Italian Credit Register with bank-specific measures of sovereign exposure, we can effectively isolate the effects of the sovereign shock on banks' credit supply from the effects imputable to a reduction in credit demand (Bocola, 2016) or a change in country-specific risk (Bofondi et al., 2017). Second, the representativeness of our sample allows us to study the heterogeneous effects of the credit tightening across firms of different sizes, which is an advantage relative to previous studies focusing only on large firms (Acharya et al., 2018). As our results highlight, investment and employment elasticities to changes in credit supply estimated for small firms differ substantially from the ones estimated for large corporations. Small firms pay a disproportionately larger price in the event of a credit crunch, even when they are not a direct target of credit cuts.====This paper also relates to the literature studying the role of banks in the international transmission of financial shocks. Previous research has focused on the relevance of international funding for domestic banks (Schnabl, 2012; Baskaya et al., 2017; Giovanni et al., 2017; Schnabl, 2012) or analyzed the importance of global financial intermediaries (Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2011; Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2013; Peek and Rosengren, 2000). Complementing these studies, our results highlight the key role of financial intermediaries' security portfolio as a significant risk factor, exposing the real economy to shocks originating outside of national borders. While our focus is on sovereign bonds, the scope of our findings is much broader, since the security channel can be triggered by any marketable security held by banks.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide some institutional background on the European sovereign debt crisis and describe the data used in the paper. In Section 3, we introduce and discuss our identification strategy, provide evidence on the presence of the bank lending channel, and document its heterogeneous effects across firms and banks. In Section 4, we show that the sovereign shock impaired firms' access to bank credit, consequently affecting their investments and employment decisions.

In this paper, we study why manufacturing firms may decide to have their products carried-along instead of exporting their products themselves. We show that if the “Delivery of Own Goods” (DOG) is an alternative option, the profitability of CAT is determined by demand linkages, productivity and transportation costs. Our focus is on the strategic aspects of CAT, and we illustrate that CAT can produce the same outcome as product-specific, market-specific collusion.","The traditional view of how goods get exported has been that firms produce and export their own products. The availability of better models and better data regarding exporting firm behavior has led to a great deal of new work studying precisely how firms export. Much of this work has focused on the use of intermediaries to assist firms in their export activities. In recent work by Bernard et al., 2019 they identify and document, using Belgian data, a different form of intermediation called carry-along trade (CAT). CAT occurs when Belgian firms export products produced by other Belgian firms in addition to their own products. The difference between CAT and typical intermediation in export markets is that CAT firms produce and export their own goods in addition to exporting goods produced by other firms. Bernard et al., 2019 show that CAT is quantitatively important: “More than 90 percent of manufacturing exporters ship at least one product that they do not make and these products represent 30 percent of export value.” This finding has also been replicated recently for Denmark (Abreha et al., 2013), Italy (Di Nino, 2015a, Di Nino, 2015b), Sweden (Arnarson, 2016), Turkey (Lo Turco and Maggioni, 2015) and France (see Bernard et al., 2019, fn 5).====Bernard et al., 2019 think of CAT as the outcome of a “make or source” decision by multi-product firms in a monopolistically competitive environment. In their paper, firms decide on the optimal scope of products to sell in a particular market, and then determine whether these products are produced in-house or sourced from independent suppliers. In that sense, CAT allows firms to add products to their product range at lower marginal costs than if they were produced in-house. The key focus of their analysis is to rationalize an important feature in the data, namely that both the number of products and the share of CAT products in total exported products are positively correlated to firm productivity. They show that in their framework certain demand and supply-side features are necessary to produce the complementarity between firm productivity and sourcing found in the data.====In this paper, we extend their view on CAT by analyzing the export mode decision in an oligopolistic framework where market power and strategic interaction matter. In our framwork, the producer of the CAT product has a choice: It can either choose to have its product carried-along by another firm (CAT case), or it can choose to “deliver” (i.e. export) its own goods (Delivery of Own Goods, DOG case). This DOG case creates an outside option that plays an important role in the decision on the mode of exporting. We are using a very simple, almost textbook-like framework, where the DOG case is essentially the standard Nash duopoly case and the CAT case is a simple multi-product firm case. By using these very simple cases we are able to show that the incentive for CAT arises naturally from strategic interactions and does not depend on specific assumptions regarding demand or technology.====We show that the CAT versus DOG decision comes down to three factors, demand linkages, changes in transportation cost, and the (relative) productivities of the two firms, and that these determinants are consistent with recent empirical evidence on CAT. Our focus on the strategic gains (from internalizing demand linkages) distinguishes our model from previous work and offers new insights in the causes and consequences of CAT.====The forces just described are not specific to ==== trade but are also present in domestic transactions. The fact that CAT is discussed as an issue of international trade is largely data driven: Data on international sales are available at the product level, while comparable data for domestic transactions are typically not. One exception is Di Nino, 2015a, Di Nino, 2015b: Using surveys of Italian firms, she presents evidence of domestic CAT, that is, firms that sell products domestically that they did not produce along with products they did produce. The fact that CAT is also present in domestic transactions seems to point away from transportation costs savings as the main driver of CAT. We discuss the possibility of domestic CAT and show that the findings of Di Nino, 2015a, Di Nino, 2015b are also consistent with our framework.====Another contribution of our paper is the study of welfare effects and distributional conflicts. The existing literature has focused mostly on explaining the empirical correlation between firm productivity and CAT. We discuss how the mode of exporting affects the intensive and extensive margins of trade, and how it affects the prices of the products traded. More specifically, by comparing DOG to CAT, we find that CAT tends to increase exports and lower prices when the two goods are complements and tends to reduce the quantity of exports and increase prices when goods are substitutes. Therefore, the mode of exporting has an impact on how rents are shifted between firms and consumers. In the case of substitutes, CAT produces the same outcome as product-specific, market-specific collusion. Finally, we discuss issues of competition for the mode of exporting. We extend our framework to a more general oligopolistic framework and show that the level of competition is important for the incentives to carry-along other products.====The issue of CAT is related to a growing literature on intermediation in global markets. Earlier papers on this topic, like Rauch and Watson (2004) or Blum et al. (2010) focussed on the issue of matching between buyers (importers) and sellers (exporters). More recent contributions have addressed the issue of direct exporting versus trade intermediation. Ahn et al. (2011) develop and test a model in which firms chose their mode of export. They can export directly or through an intermediary. They show that less productive firms tend to use intermediaries more and that markets that have higher export costs have more exports handled by intermediaries. Antràs and Costinot (2011) study the role of intermediaries for the integration or segmentation of markets in a global economy. Bernard et al. (2015) find that export intermediaries such as wholesalers serve different markets and export different products than manufacturing exporters do. Akerman (2018) builds a model of intermediation based on firm heterogeneity. In his model the most productive firms export without using an intermediary and the least productive firms do not export. Ganapati (2018) shows that the increase in intermediation is driven to a large extend by “superstar” effects based on economies of scale.====The major difference between these studies and CAT is that intermediaries are typically modelled as firms with a comparative advantage in trading, usually as a result of economies of scale. In this case, intermediation exists because it lowers cost. One of our points here is that CAT can be profitable even if joint exporting is associated with higher transportation costs.====This paper is also related to recent work on multi-product firms. Bernard et al. (2007) show that “...engaging in international trade is an exceedingly rare activity: of the 5.5 million firms operating in the United States in 2000, just 4 percent were exporters. Among these exporting firms, the top 10 percent accounted for 96 percent of total U.S. exports.... In 2000, 42.2 percent of exporting firms exported a single product abroad ...these exporters represented a small share of aggregate exports, just 0.4 percent...Firms exporting five or more products accounted for 25.9 percent of firms but 98 percent of export value.” This illustrates the importance of multi-product firms in exporting activities. We are able to show that CAT plays a role in explaining the dominance of a small number of large firms in exporting because we establish that more productive firms carry along more products. Bernard et al., 2019 illustrate in figure 1 of their paper that “Except for the category of single-product exporters, firms in every other category report greater numbers of products exported than products produced. Multi-product exporters are also multi-product domestic producers but the number of exported products increases much more rapidly than the number of produced products.” Another similarity our paper has with the multi-product literature is that CAT allows firms to internalize demand linkages, like in recent multi-product models by Eckel and Neary (2010) and Dhingra (2013).====We begin in Section 2 by highlighting empirical regularities that are important for our analysis. In Section 3 we turn to our theoretical analysis and begin with the duopoly case. Section 4 then considers the effect of CAT on prices and quantities. In Section 5 we characterize CAT in a more general oligopoly model and Section 6 concludes.",CATs and DOGs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300544,21 April 2020,2020,Research Article,174.0

When the incumbent has preferences over distribution of resources across different groups, in a transparent economy political uncertainty leads to ","The macroeconomic literature has largely investigated the cross-country heterogeneity of macroeconomic variables, especially considering business cycle statistics, namely the variability of output, consumption, investment, and interest rates; however, the heterogeneity and the determinants of debt dynamics across countries is a much less examined issue.==== In this paper we argue that an important and not-yet analyzed determinant of debt incentives is the interaction between political conflicts and transparency of institutions. The rationale behind this effect stems from how these two variables affect strategical political incentives to borrow.====Our contribution is both empirical and theoretical. First, from an empirical point of view, we analyze how our two institutional variables of interest, namely ==== and ====, affect observed public debt for a comprehensive set of economies. We focus on these two variables for the following reasons. Political conflicts aim to capture the degree of disagreement within a country, which affects the opportunity cost of not-being elected. We proxy political conflicts with measures of fractionalization within a country, as supported by a large body of research.==== In a nutshell, in our paper political conflict captures how much at stake there is in an election. Our second variable of interest is ====, which aims to capture the difficulties for voters to recognize the true ability of policy makers, and, therefore, their propensity to base their electoral preferences on recent economic performance. This effect could arise for several reasons: for example, governments might lack of transparency in communicating their policies; also, corruption might affect policy makers' credibility; especially in emerging and developing countries governments might restrict the freedom and independence of the media and, more generally, freedom of expression is not guaranteed.====Our main empirical result shows that, whereas ==== and ====, per-se, are not significant determinants of observed debt levels across countries, their interaction is a key factor to explain debt-levels heterogeneity. To test this hypothesis we perform cross-country regressions of debt-to-GDP data using our proxies of ==== and ====. Our sample includes 66 countries that are heterogeneous in terms of economic development: we have included OECD economies, emerging economies, and developing economies. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, the simple regression of debt levels on political conflict and lack of transparency yields non-significant (but positive) coefficients: this means that political conflict, per-se, does not contribute significantly to increasing debt. Second, and more importantly, when we add an interaction term between the two variables, the interaction term is positive and significant, while the coefficient associated to political conflict changes the sign and become negative. This implies that if political conflict increases in a transparent economy (low lack of transparency values), its effect on debt is negative (which means it incentivizes saving); on the contrary, in a non-transparent economy (high lack of transparency values) large political conflicts induce borrowing (more debt). This result is robust to adding additional control variables and to a more complete second order regression.====The rationale behind these findings stems from the following intuition. As pointed out in Alt and Lassen (2006) and Shi and Svensson (2006), when governments might have unobservable characteristics, in non-transparent economies voters must rely simply on economic conditions as a possible signal about the quality of the government. The incentives to bust economic condition by using of public debt is a function of the opportunity cost of losing elections, which relates to the degree of political conflict. In a transparent economy, inflating economic performances via debt is not beneficial since voters can disentangle this effect from the true ability of the government. On the contrary, when the economy is non-transparent, voters might be more likely to show support to the current government if the country enjoys larger amount of resources, thus increasing incentives to borrow for the incumbent.====In our theoretical contribution, we propose a rather simple model that can explain our empirical findings. The starting point is a conventional open-economy real business cycle model similar to Uribe and Yue (2006): an economy is endowed with an exogenous and persistent stream of output and the incumbent makes intertemporal decision on debt to smooth consumption over time. We add political uncertainty into this model: in each period the incumbent has a certain probability to be re-elected. In addition, we include also political conflict and transparency. Regarding political conflict, similarly to Alesina and Tabellini (1990b), parties have preferences over distribution across different groups and decide the allocation of consumption according to these preferences. A single parameter, which we refer to as the degree of political conflict, determines how unequally the incumbent would like to split aggregate resources. The higher is the degree of political conflict, the larger are the benefits from being in power.====We emphasize that when political uncertainty is characterized by a constant probability to be reelected, political conflicts per-se are not necessarily able to produce borrowing incentives. For example, when the incumbent has Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) preferences with risk aversion coefficient greater than one, political uncertainty and political frictions alone, i.e. in a transparent economy, induce precautionary savings. In fact, with these preferences, the incumbent would like to transfer resources from her incumbent-state to a possible future opposition-state, thus leading to incentives to postpone consumption. This feature is consistent with our empirical result that political conflict, in a transparent economy, has a negative sign on its relationship with debt.====Then, we introduce the feature of ====. We assume that in non-transparent economies, the probability of an incumbent to be re-elected is more strongly a function of current economic conditions.==== Empirical studies, such as Pacek and Radcliff (1995), Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier (2000), and Bartels (2013), support the notion that economic performance is a crucial determinant of electoral outcomes and political approval. In our model we show that political conflict ==== retrospective voting induces borrowing incentives for the incumbent. Intuitively, when the electorate is particularly sensitive to economic conditions, an incumbent is willing to borrow in order to increase current consumption to gain political advantage against the opposition.====Finally, we bring the model to the data. We use the theoretical predictions of our model on a set of observable macroeconomic and political variables to estimate both the degree of transparency and political conflict that are able to match these moments. Recall the two main theoretical findings: first, without lack of transparency, stronger political conflict lead to larger ==== incentives; second, when lack of transparency is instead high, stronger political conflict leads to larger ==== incentives. These predictions have effects on average debt, average length of government spells, consumption variance, and trade-balance variance. Therefore, we make use of these predictions to structurally estimate the degree of transparency and political conflict for each country that it is able to make these model predictions as close as possible to their observed counterpart. This strategy yields a cross section set of estimates for our two parameters of interest, the degree of political conflict and lack of transparency. Notice that we use only observed macroeconomic moments to estimate these frictions, without using any information about the observed degree of these frictions. Hence, the second natural step is to investigate how our estimates correlate, in the cross-section, with observed proxies of political conflict and lack of transparency. Our finding can be summarized as follows. First, the model strongly support the existence of these frictions. Second, the estimated frictions positively and significantly relate to their data counterparts. Third, once one takes into account possible sources of bias, coming from observing imperfect measures of the frictions and from estimating the frictions with a stylized model that might ignore important effects, the positive relationship becomes even stronger. Hence, we are confident that the mechanism proposed in our model can rationalize the empirical importance of the interaction between political conflict and lack of transparency as observed in the data.====The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we validate the main theoretical results on the cross section of debt to output ratios across countries. In Section 3 we present our model and the political economy environment, In Section 4 we describe the estimation strategy and we test the relevance of our model. In Section 5 we present the final remarks.","Transparency, political conflict, and debt",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618301466,18 April 2020,2020,Research Article,175.0

These measures included purchases of long-term assets, the scale of which was unprecedented in modern economic history. Fig. 1 offers one way of documenting this process by showing that asset purchases in the United States, the United Kingdom and the euro area substantially lowered the share of long-term government bonds in total supply of consolidated public sector liabilities: by the end of 2017 this share had decreased by over 14 percentage points as compared with 2009.====The primary goal of these operations, popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE), was to reduce long-term interest rates and overcome the ongoing slump in economic activity. However, given the importance of monetary policy in the countries that implemented these programs for global financial cycles (as documented e.g. by Rey, 2013), the scale of asset purchases provoked a heated debate among policymakers on their net benefits to other economies. Some of them were expressing concerns about excessive currency appreciation in small open economies (SOEs) and possible imbalances in emerging markets, see e.g. Rajan (2016), and a speech by Per Jansson invoked in Bluwstein and Canova (2016). Others were stressing a favorable impact of quantitative easing on global demand, see e.g. Blanchard (2016), and speeches by Ben Bernanke and Mario Draghi quoted by Bhattarai et al. (2015) and Falagiarda et al. (2015).====The existing empirical evidence provides fairly strong support for the positive impact of quantitative easing on financial markets. A number of papers have confirmed a significant reduction of long-term yields in the economies that engaged in asset purchase programs, especially in the US economy, see e.g. Gagnon et al. (2011), Joyce et al. (2011), D'Amico et al. (2012), Baumeister and Benati (2013), Kiley (2014). On the other hand, Neely (2015), Fratzscher et al. (2018), Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Lim and Mohapatra (2016) and Tillmann (2016) all stress that quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve resulted in procyclical capital inflows into emerging markets and appreciation of their exchange rates. Falagiarda et al. (2015) find similar effects of the ECB non-standard monetary policy measures on Central and Eastern European countries that are tightly integrated with the euro area.====To illustrate the magnitude of capital inflows to sovereign bond markets in SOEs, we plot in Fig. 2 the share of non-resident investors holdings in the outstanding bonds issued by emerging market governments (in their currencies). Since 2009, this share has increased by about 15 percentage points. It is important to note that this capital inflow into emerging economies' sovereign bond markets was not matched by offsetting capital outflows associated with other debt securities. As Fig. 3 shows, a massive increase of this group of countries' international liabilities can be observed also for a broader category of debt securities that additionally cover government bonds issued in foreign markets and private debt securities. At the same time, the corresponding gross asset position expressed as a percentage of GDP remained flat, so the observed processes resulted in large net capital inflows. Naturally, flows of this type and scale must have affected asset prices. First, they impacted prices of long-term bonds issued by the recipient countries. As Fig. 4 strikingly reveals, the comovement between the term premium on 10-year US treasuries and 10-year bonds issued by the governments of SOEs has significantly increased since 2009.====Second, massive capital flows driven by quantitative easing affected exchange rates. To illustrate this effect, we utilize the so-called Fama regressions (Fama, 1984). Table 1 reports the estimated slope on the interest rate differential and on its interaction with a QE dummy for bilateral exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar, estimated on a panel of data for 17 small open economies. As it has been documented many times in the literature, the coefficient in normal (pre-QE) times is far away from unity implied by the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition, and statistically insignificant from zero at conventional levels. During the period of large scale asset purchases initiated by the Fed, the slope becomes significantly negative. This effect is observed both for advanced and emerging economies, but is stronger for the latter group.====Overall, the existing evidence suggests that, while there are strong reasons to believe that the reaction of financial markets to unconventional monetary policy contributed to revival in economic activity in countries pursuing quantitative easing, the net effect on other countries' output is not clear. On the one hand, improved economic conditions in countries engaged in asset purchases stimulate their demand for imports. Moreover, the induced world-wide compression of long-term yields should support spending in SOEs. On the other hand, this favorable impact can be offset by the exchange rate appreciation associated with increased capital inflows. Bhattarai et al. (2015) offer some support for the hypothesis that the net effect of quantitative easing pursued by major economies on output in other economies does not need to be positive. Using a VAR analysis, they fail to detect a significantly positive impact of the Fed non-standard measures on GDP in emerging markets, and some of their specifications actually suggest negative effects.====In this paper we contribute to this debate by proposing a model that helps understand and quantitatively analyze international spillovers of long-term asset purchase programs pursued by the major central banks, and in particular the capital flows that this type of unconventional policy generates. We build on the segmented asset markets framework considered by Andres et al. (2004), and more recently further developed by Chen et al. (2012). Our main modeling extension is to formulate this environment in an open economy, two-country setup. In the model we propose, agents can trade long-term bonds issued by the two governments so that changes in their supply trigger portfolio adjustments that have real effects on both economies.==== Also, as recently advocated by Passari and Rey (2015), we define financial linkages in terms of gross rather than net international positions in assets.====We calibrate the two-country model to Poland, a typical small open economy pursuing independent conventional monetary policy and deeply integrated with the rest of the world, and a conglomerate of three big economies whose central banks engaged in long-term asset purchases during the last decade, namely the United States, the United Kingdom and the euro area. We next use this model to simulate the quantitative easing in the large economies. We find that the model is able to replicate the salient features of the data discussed above. In particular, it generates an inflow of foreign capital to the small economy's sovereign bond market that matches the data very well. In line with what we show in Fig. 4, the model also implies very strong comovement of term premia in the two regions during the period of quantitative easing, but not necessarily in normal times. Finally, it correctly predicts the estimated downward shift in the slope of exchange rate projections on the interest rate differential (Fama regressions) during the period of QE.====According to our model-based simulations, quantitative easing abroad boosts domestic demand in the small economy, but strongly undermines its international competitiveness and depresses economic activity as measured with GDP, at least in the short run. This is in contrast to the effects of conventional monetary easing abroad, which positively affects the small economy's output. Our model is hence consistent with the empirical findings on conventional monetary policy spillovers (Mackowiak, 2007; Banerjee et al., 2016; Dedola et al., 2017; Iacoviello and Navarro, 2019) and unconventional ones (Bhattarai et al., 2015). From the model's perspective, the differences between these two forms of monetary accommodation are related to the size of international capital movements and exchange rate adjustments they induce. For a given magnitude of impact on the large economy's output, central bank asset purchases generate a much larger inflow of non-residents into sovereign long-term bond markets of other countries, resulting in a much sharper appreciation of their real exchange rates. In this sense, our model-based predictions support the concerns raised e.g. by Rajan (2016) about the impact of quantitative easing in advanced countries on emerging economies.====One way of interpreting our results is that the small economy's central bank by using only conventional policy can easily control the short end of the domestic yield curve, but is less powerful in affecting its long end. Therefore, following QE in the large economy that strongly depresses foreign long-term rates, the equalization of ex ante returns on home and foreign bonds is achieved mainly by exchange rate and term premium adjustment, the mirror image of which are massive capital inflows to the small economy. Indeed, our framework implies that limiting the negative impact of unconventional monetary policy spillovers is much easier with interventions that directly address the associated financial flows, like purchasing long-term bonds by the small economy. This outcome is consistent with Blanchard (2016), who calls for international coordination of large scale asset purchases.====The closest paper to ours is the recent work by Alpanda and Kabaca (2020), who develop a two-country model with portfolio balance effects to investigate international spillovers of large scale asset purchases in the US to the rest of the world. Similarly to ours, their model predicts capital inflows into the markets for long-term bonds issued by other economies. However, their simulations also feature offsetting capital flows, and in particular a massive increase in short-term US bond holdings by the rest of the world, which does not fit the experience of small open economies that we focus on. As a result, the net capital inflow to countries not engaged in quantitative easing is moderate, their trade balance does not deteriorate much, and its negative effect on output is easily dwarfed by a boost in domestic demand. Our model instead, in line with evidence from emerging markets, restricts international trade in short-term bonds, hence generating bigger net capital flows following QE abroad, whose negative effect on the domestic economy's international competitiveness is strong enough to result in a fall in its output. In this sense, our paper is similar to the literature highlighting the role of exchange rate adjustments and international financial flows, including the beggar-thy-neighbor effects, during the period of extremely low global interest rates (see e.g. Caballero et al., 2015; Eggertsson et al., 2016; Cook and Devereux, 2016; Haberis and Lipinska, 2020). Our work is also related to the recent line of papers featuring limited international arbitrage due to the presence of financially constrained intermediaries, which makes foreign currency interventions potentially effective (Gabaix and Maggiori, 2015; Amador et al., 2020; Fanelli and Straub, 2018).====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section two presents the model and section three discusses its calibration. Section four offers a deeper discussion of the asset market segmentation in our model. The baseline QE scenario and its international spillovers are presented in section five. Section six compares QE spillovers to those associated with conventional monetary policy. The most important robustness checks are covered in section seven.

This paper presents a tractable ==== model that incorporates all three of these mechanisms. Our model allows us to confront Chinese firm-level data on the prices charged and revenues earned within and across markets. We show that all three mechanisms are necessary to fit the distribution of prices and revenues across firms and markets. Accounting for endogenous quality heterogeneity across firms and markets is shown to be critical for the response of prices to trade and tariff shocks.","The literature on quantitative general equilibrium models has blossomed in recent years. The popularity of these models is driven by their simplicity, by their ease of calibration, and by their flexibility to be adapted for the analysis of the impact of a wide variety of policies. Further, as shown by Eaton et al. (2011) these models can successfully confront firm-level microdata on the distribution of sales within and across countries. One feature of the microdata that has received less attention in the development of quantitative general equilibrium models is the joint distribution of firm-level prices and sales within and across countries. As has been shown in existing descriptive work (e.g. Manova and Zhang, 2012), firms from a given source country charge very different prices across countries.====In this paper we develop a simple quantitative general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms that has been designed to confront the joint distribution of firm-level prices and sales. Variations in prices within-firm, across-country stem from the interaction between trade costs that vary between countries, firms' decisions to price-to-market, and firms' endogenous provision of goods of different quality to different countries. Our model includes all three of these features. With respect to trade cost, we explicitly allow for both standard iceberg (ad-valorem) trade costs and specific (fixed per unit) trade costs. This is natural because both types of trade costs are likely to be a feature of the constraints facing exporters in the real world and because the interaction between the two types of trade costs has been shown to affect the quality decision of firms (Hummels and Skiba, 2004).====We also allow firms to choose the quality of goods that they provide to each market that they serve. We assume that the marginal cost of production is increasing in output quality and decreasing in firm productivity. Because specific trade costs are not increasing in the quality of goods sold, firms can lower their cost of serving markets with high specific trade costs by upgrading quality, and the incentive to do this is rising in a firm's productivity because these firms sell the largest number of units. Hence, our specification delivers a “Washington-Apples” effect that varies in strength across both countries and firms and so provides a mechanism to fit the joint distribution of prices and revenues.====With respect to pricing-to-market, we follow Jung et al. (2019) by assuming CES-like preferences that have been generalized to allow for an endogenous “choke price”. Firms in our model first minimize quality-adjusted marginal costs and then set quality-adjusted prices to maximize profits in each market that they serve. While the correlation between quality-adjusted prices and quality-adjusted revenue will be negative due to the optimal markup choices of the firm, the correlation between observed (unadjusted) prices and (unadjusted) revenues will be positive as in the data.====Combining firm heterogeneity, endogenous quality, and pricing-to-market all together, our simple model generates rich predictions regarding across-firm and across-country price variations. Qualitatively, our model is consistent with a well documented range of facts regarding the joint distribution of prices across firms and across countries. Further, the model can capture the positive relationship in the data between a firm's price and the its revenue. More importantly, the key contribution of our model is the parsimonious and highly tractable framework which allows us to conduct a quantitative general equilibrium analysis.====Our paper also has novel implications for the estimation of gravity equations. A large class of models generates gravity equations in which the elasticity of trade flows with respect to trade costs reveals key structural parameters (Arkolakis et al., 2012; Arkolakis et al., 2019). Our model also generates a gravity equation in which the appropriate measure of trade costs is the geometric average of specific and iceberg trade costs where the weights reflect the elasticity of marginal cost with respect to quality. In standard models a common way to estimate the trade elasticity using tariffs, which are generally ad-valorem, as a measure of trade costs (e.g. Head and Mayer, 2014). In our framework with specific trade costs, this calibration strategy necessarily leads to an underestimate of the key macro elasticity. We calibrate our model to aggregate trade flows (gravity) and to the joint distribution of firm-country level price and sales from Chinese customs data.====Our model also contributes to our understanding of the response of prices to trade cost shocks. Much recent work analyzes the markup responses of firms to changes in trade policy (e.g. De Loecker et al., 2016; Jung et al., 2019). In our setting, shocks to trade costs affect firm-level prices through multiple mechanisms. On the one hand, firms respond to any shock to quality-adjusted marginal costs by changing their markups. On the other hand, firms also adjust the quality of their output and this induces a price response as quality-adjusted marginal costs change.====To illustrate the potential for quality adjustment to be confused for adjustment in markups, we consider a comparative static exercise in which we alternatively shock specific and iceberg trade costs to each Chinese trading partner by enough to lower trade by 5%. These shocks have equivalent welfare effects but generate very different price responses. Because increases in specific trade costs induce firms to raise their quality, they lead to exaggerated price increases, whereas shocks to ad valorem trade costs induce firms to lower the quality of the goods they provide and so lead to small changes in prices. Hence, the model demonstrates the need to know the nature of trade shocks before making predictions over the associated price changes.==== This is important as it shows how micro-econometric models that neglect specific trade costs may be misspecified.====Our paper contributes to two strands of the literature that seek to understand the causes and implications of international prices. First, our focus on endogenous quality puts our paper into a literature that includes the recent paper by Feenstra and Romalis (2014) who provide a monopolistic competition model that has been designed to estimate the quality of goods traded and sold domestically with the intention of purging price indices of quality variation across countries. As the authors are working with country-level data, they do not develop their model to confront the joint distribution of firm-level prices and sales, which is the focus of our paper.====Our paper also contributes to the literature featuring variable markups. These papers include Jung et al. (2019) and Atkeson and Burstein (2008). As in Jung et al. (2019), we consider non-homothetic preferences and a market structure that gives rise to variable markups across firms. Relative to their paper, we also consider vertically differentiated products, quality upgrading opportunities, and specific trade costs that give rise to the “Washington Apples” effect. Our framework, therefore, allows for much of the variation across countries and firms to be attributed not to variation in market power but to variation in quality of output. Allowing for quality upgrading helps to make the model with variable markups more consistent with the well-known pattern in the data that the most successful exporters tend to charge the highest prices (e.g. Manova and Zhang, 2012; Harrigan et al., 2015). Moreover, our framework highlights the differential effect of specific and ad valorem trade costs on the international distribution of prices.====In the literature, models that feature firm heterogeneity, endogenous quality, and variable markups are rare. An important exception is Antoniades (2015) who embeds endogenous quality into the model of Melitz-Ottaviano (Melitz and Ottaviano, 2008). The focus of the Antoniades's model is on the role of market size and scale economies in driving endogeneous quality and so it lacks the “Washington Apples” mechanism that is our focus. Nevertheless, the model presented in Antoniades (2015) generates a rich set of predictions that can be qualitatively consistent with many of the facts presented in our paper. The Antoniades paper does not confront its model with the data, however, and doing so would be difficult given the complex interaction in the model of its parameters and endogenous variables.====Finally, our paper is also related to the recent work by Hottman et al. (2016) who allow for both market power and quality heterogeneity to drive price dispersion across local prices in the United States. They find that a very substantial portion of heterogeneity in market shares can be attributed to quality heterogeneity but with firms' strategic pricing decisions also playing a non-trivial role. By considering a more parsimonious setting, we can conduct an analysis of the role of markup and quality dispersions to an international setting. In addition, we follow Arkolakis et al. (2019) and derive a sufficient-statistic-type welfare formula for the gains from trade with the presence of both endogenous quality and variable markups.====The remainder of this paper is organized into six sections. In Section 2, we develop a series of stylized facts concerning the international pricing behavior of Chinese firms that we will use to calibrate our model. In Section 3, we present a simple, quantitative general equilibrium model that is able to rationalize these stylized facts and that can be quantified with features of our data. In Section 4, we describe how we solve, calibrate and simulate our benchmark model. In Section 5, we assess the model's fit to the data, and derive an expression for the welfare gains from trade shocks to show the model's quantitative implications for the gains from trade. In Section 6, we illustrate how specific and ad valorem trade shocks that have identical effects on welfare and on trade volumes have very different effects on prices. Finally, in Section 7, we provide concluding comments.","Quality, variable markups, and welfare: A quantitative general equilibrium analysis of export prices",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300465,13 April 2020,2020,Research Article,177.0

Intermediaries provide indirect access to foreign produced inputs. The productivity effects of input tariff cuts on firms that do not directly import therefore depends on the extent that wholesalers are a feature of input supply within an ,"The international economics literature provides clear evidence that the productivity of firms improves as a direct consequence of trade liberalization.==== Several explanations have been put forward to explain these productivity increases.==== Initially these focused on the effect of output tariffs increasing competition within the industry, in a process labelled ‘trimming the fat’ (Pavcnik, 2002). More recently the focus has been on the role of inputs. Here it is argued that the ability to import intermediate inputs generates productivity gains for firms through learning, variety and quality effects. Amiti and Konings (2007) were the first to investigate this and report using Indonesian data that the productivity gains from input tariff reductions were around twice as large as those from output tariff changes of the same size. Supportive evidence can be found in Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008) for Chile, Halpern et al. (2015) for Hungary, Khandelwal and Topalova (2011) for India, and Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2015) for France.====Of interest to this paper, Amiti and Konings (2007) also report positive productivity effects from cuts to input tariffs for what are normally labelled as non-importing firms, although they are strongest for those that directly importing intermediate inputs. In this paper, we investigate whether this ‘domestic firm puzzle’==== is explained by the presence of input trade intermediaries. More commonly known as wholesalers, such service sector firms provide indirect access to foreign produced inputs. Our empirical evidence shows that when the intermediation of inputs through wholesalers is a strong feature of input supply within an industry, there are productivity gains for firms not directly importing. In their absence, there are productivity declines. The investigation of these productivity outcomes due to the presence of wholesalers represents the main contribution of the paper to the broader literature.====The economic literature has long recognized the role that wholesalers and retailers play in linking producers with their consumers. Intermediaries have been argued to exist in order to reduce search costs by offering their market expertise or guaranteeing the quality of goods (Rubinstein and Wolinsky, 1987; Yavas, 1994; Biglaiser, 1993; Biglaiser and Friedman, 1994). Their importance in cross-border trade has been revealed only in more recent years. According to Jones (1998), trading companies account for over 40% of exports and over 70% of imports in Japan, while Blum et al. (2009) document that 41% of imports occur through intermediaries in Chile. Using detailed information from trade transaction data, Bernard et al. (2010) estimate that wholesale and retail firms account for 10% of exports and 24% of imports in US. In our data for China, wholesalers account on average for 21.4% of total imports of intermediate inputs across manufacturing sectors. Theoretical developments in this trade literature include Ahn et al. (2011), Akerman (2010), Antràs and Costinot, 2010, Antràs and Costinot, 2011, Blum et al. (2009), Crozet et al. (2013) Rauch, 1999, Rauch, 2001, Felbermayr and Jung (2011), Petropoulou (2008) and Rauch and Watson (2004). A general finding from this literature is that trade intermediaries provide access to international markets for those firms that would otherwise find the costs of exporting directly prohibitive. A corollary to this outcome for exports, would be that for some domestic firms, wholesalers represent a source of foreign produced intermediate inputs they would not otherwise have.====To empirically evaluate the productivity effects of wholesalers for firms not directly importing during a period of input tariff liberalization we construct a novel industry level measure using Chinese custom data, balance sheet data and input–outputs tables. To separate direct-importers from those that do not directly import we use the customs data matched to balance sheet data. To construct our industry-specific measure of inputs imported by wholesalers, we begin by identifying for each sector the fraction of import transactions by wholesalers and trade intermediaries.==== Using input-output tables we can then proportion the share of these inputs sold on to other sectors of the economy.==== Using data for the period 2002–2006, which corresponds to the period soon after China's entry to World Trade Organization (on 11th December 2001), we generate a number of findings. We first show we can replicate the findings from Amiti and Konings (2007) and others, that the revenue-based productivity of direct-importers along with those not directly importing improves as a consequence of input tariff liberalization, and that the benefits to direct importers are greater. To highlight the role played by trade intermediaries we explore how the effect of input tariff cuts differ for firms according to the extent of wholesaling of imported inputs in their industry. The analysis reveals that the productivity of firms not directly importing increases when input tariffs fall, only if wholesalers are an important source of input supply in the industry. When wholesalers are unimportant, our results suggest productivity declines for such firms.====A possible explanation for these results draws from well know reallocation effect as in Melitz (2003), induced by the trade liberalization in the intermediate input sector. As tariffs decrease, direct importers as well as firms importing through wholesalers are able to import new input varieties from more efficient suppliers and, potentially, at a higher quality, which ultimately could increase their productivity. At the same time, non-importing firms may face a decrease in the domestic inputs supplied to them due to the increase of competition in the input supplier sector, leading to a decrease in their productivity. In this case, the effect of input trade liberalization on the productivity of non-direct importers captured by the empirical literature (e.g. Amiti and Konings, 2007) will be a composition of the effects on from firms reliant solely on domestic suppliers and those importing through wholesalers. Ultimately the overall effect will depend on the importance of wholesalers within an industry.====This role for service sector firms to mediate the effects of trade liberalization can be seen to complement other potential explanations, in particular those that come from other manufacturing firms along the supply chain. Fieler et al. (2018) develop a quantitative framework using the ideas of spillovers to generate such outcomes. In their model, firms upgrade quality following the decision to import or export. This leads to an increase in the demand for high-quality inputs at home, implying skill upgrading for labor and quality upgrading for materials inputs. These positive demand effects are amplified through domestic supply chains, including for those not directly involved in trade, who are also induced to upgrade quality. Using Colombian firm-level data Eslava et al. (2015) are also able to show empirically that importing intermediate inputs allows firms to upgrade their technology. They document positive spillover effects, not only for importers, but also for non-importers (or non-traders) they supply inputs to. An alternative mechanism is offered by Tintelnot et al. (2018), who show that non-importing firms may benefit from their links to trading firms. Using firm-to-firm sales for Belgium they show firms can be directly impacted by international trade through imports, as well as indirectly through the inputs that may have been imported by their domestic suppliers. They use this data to estimate models of production networks and international trade including allowing for endogenous network formation. They find within such a model that this amplifies the gains to trade from a positive trade shock.====The presence of spillovers discussed in Eslava et al. (2015), or the endogenous supplier networks in Tintelnot et al. (2018), would ensure that firms both directly and indirectly involved in international trade benefit from imported inputs by other manufacturing firms. In this paper we do not rule out the presence of these additional mechanisms, although our finding of a negative effect for non-direct importing firms when wholesaling is low, would not easily been explained by these alternative forces alone. The identification assumption that underpins our findings is that these other benefits from trade liberalization for firms not directly importing are uncorrelated with links to the service sector that we explore using the measure of industry wholesaling. To provide support for this assumption, we undertake a wide array of robustness tests including falsification tests and tests for treatment heterogeneity. Initial support for this assumption can be drawn from the fact that the presence of wholesalers does not matter for those firms directly importing. We find that firms directly importing benefit from trade liberalization, as would occur within the Eslava et al. (2015) and Tintelnot et al. (2018) models, but there is no heterogeneity across these firms associated with the extent of wholesaling. Wholesalers boosts revenue-based productivity during the period of trade liberalization only for those firms not directly importing.====As an additional falsification test we also show that wholesalers play no role if firms import under processing trade rules, where imports are not subject to tariffs and wholesaling effects are absent. We further extend the analysis to use ownership as a means of capturing those firms for which wholesaling is likely to be a more important feature of input supply. We find from these tests for treatment heterogeneity that wholesalers deliver important productivity impacts for domestically owned firms, whereas for foreign owned firms, who are likely to have access to foreign produced inputs through other channels or have preferential access, they play no role.====A small literature has also shown that increased globalization among service sector firms can affect the productivity performance of firms in the manufacturing sector. For instance, Arnold et al. (2011) and Arnold et al. (2016) document that service sector reforms increased firm performance within downstream manufacturing sectors using those services as inputs in the Czech Republic and India, respectively. Our work differs in that it is the intermediate inputs that serve to raise firm productivity, rather than the service acting as the source of that change. This paper therefore highlights an additional source of productivity gains from trade liberalization through trade intermediation services. We also consider this possible alternative role for wholesalers within the analysis, firstly by removing exporters and then later by constructing an additional measure of wholesaling for exports and for output goods. The results are suggestive of an effect from wholesalers for both output goods and exports, but the main results for imported inputs remain intact.====As a final section on robustness we also attempt to control for these additional mechanisms in a more direct manner by including additional control variables in the regression. We are able to show that our main findings for non-direct importers are robust to the addition of alternative sources of productivity gains, allowing the effects of trade liberalization to differ for these firms according to the degree of import competition, the quality of inputs or their position within the supply chain (upstreamness). They are also robust to the use of an instrumental variable approach to deal with endogeneity concerns about input tariff cuts. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that wholesalers guard against productivity losses from trade liberalization for firms that do not directly import.====In developing this set of findings, we recognise a number of studies that have previously investigated the effects of trade liberalization on Chinese firms. A number of these report productivity effects from input tariff changes and differences across firms or industries. For example, Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2015) show that following an input tariff reduction, firms importing under ordinary trade rules increased both their import and export prices compared to pure processing importers (which by definition are not subject to input tariffs). They conclude from this that input tariff liberalization led to quality upgrading of imported inputs, which in turn, implied quality upgrading of exported outputs. Brandt et al. (2017), Hu and Liu (2014) and Yu (2015) consider the effect of input tariff liberalization across all Chinese manufacturing firms and find positive effects of similar magnitude to ours. Yu (2015) also documents that the productivity gains are weaker for firms importing using processing arrangements. Finally, Yu et al. (2013) show that the increase in import penetration led to productivity improvements for firms producing differentiated goods, while the efficiency of firms producing homogenous goods was negatively affected. The role played by trade intermediation has so far been omitted from this literature.====The remaining paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly outlines the theoretical motivation, along with its connection with the data that we have available. A fuller version of the model is available in Appendix A. In Section 3 we discuss the data and construction of the main variables of interest, along with the empirical strategy. The main results of the paper are presented in Section 4, while in Section 5 we draw some final conclusions from the analysis.","Trade liberalization, input intermediaries and firm productivity: Evidence from China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618301636,11 April 2020,2020,Research Article,178.0

The estimated sensitivity to US ==== systems.","International capital flows channel financial resources across borders to both public and private sector borrowers. As such, they are critically important for economic growth and financial stability. Understanding their main drivers is crucial, as flows should contribute to economic growth and risk sharing internationally, without excessive volatility. Moreover, the structure and volatility of international loan and bond flows changed considerably in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).====The initial sharp decline in cross-border loans after the GFC was followed by a feeble recovery and a second sharp contraction during the peak of the euro area crisis (Graph 1.). Meanwhile, international bond issuance remained relatively robust. As a consequence, the composition of global liquidity has shifted away from cross-border bank loans and towards international bonds in what has been dubbed “the second wave of global liquidity” (Shin, 2013). Events such as the “taper tantrum” in 2013, when the Federal Reserve signalled it would start tapering its bond buying program, were marked by especially sharp capital outflows from a number of emerging markets (Khatiwada, 2017). An extensive literature has established that the two main global liquidity components, cross-border loan and bond flows through market-based participants, are impacted not only by local factors, but also by global factors. Advanced economy monetary policies and global risk aversion are established as the two most important global drivers (e.g. Forbes and Warnock, 2012; Schularick and Taylor, 2012; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015; Cerutti et al., 2017b; Ha et al., 2017). Yet, little attention has been paid to the time variation in the sensitivities of key capital flows to those drivers.====In this paper, we fill a key gap in the literature by studying the nature and the causes of the time variation in the sensitivities of the main components of global liquidity to global factors. Our contribution to this important strand of the literature has multiple layers. First we document in a robust manner that the sensitivity of the main global liquidity components to global factors varied considerably in the period after the GFC. Second, we decompose the variation in sensitivities into behavioural components and compositional components of banking systems participating in global liquidity flows. Last but not least, we drill down into the observed time variation, examine its proximate reasons, and distinguish between persistent versus transitory drivers.====This empirical analysis takes advantage of the rich dimensionality of multiple datasets - the BIS International Debt Securities (IDS) Statistics, the BIS Locational Banking Statistics (LBS) and the BIS Consolidated Banking Statistics (CBS). The combined information in the above datasets facilitates examining the behaviour of key global liquidity components while distinguishing among borrowing countries, lending national banking systems, instrument types (debt securities versus bank loans), borrowing sectors (bank versus non-bank). We also utilise information on lending banking systems' balance sheet characteristics and on monetary and prudential policy developments in both borrowers and creditor countries. The combination of the above datasets generates a rich quarterly panel of international bank loan and bond flows to 64 recipient countries for the period between 2000:Q1 and 2015:Q4.====The first key set of results documents the considerable shift in international capital flow sensitivities to global drivers since the GFC. US monetary policy became a more potent driver of both cross-border loan and international bond flows, with estimated policy impact peaking in 2013 and then partially retracing towards pre-crisis levels. Our estimates suggest that a 100-basis point increase in the Federal funds rate would reduce total cross-border flows by an estimated 8% in the years immediately after the crisis and by 4.5% afterwards, up from just 2% pre-crisis. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of cross-border bank loan flows to global risk conditions declined considerably post-crisis and became similar to the traditionally lower risk sensitivity of international bond flows. A one-percent change in the VIX measure would reduce total cross border flows by 3% pre-crisis, with this effect falling to about 1% after 2013.====Taken together, the above results imply that there was a post-GFC convergence between the sensitivities of international loan and bond flows. More concretely, prior to the crisis, US monetary policy and global risk conditions had a significant impact on loan flows, but not on bond flows. After the crisis, bond flows appear to have inherited the sensitivities of loans flows to global factors. We interpret this finding as a partial manifestation of the post-crisis shift in international financial intermediation towards international bond markets, documented by Shin (2013).====The second key set of results reveals that the dynamics of the cross-border loan sensitivities to the two major global drivers (US monetary policy and global risk conditions) are explained by fundamentally different sets of factors. The post-crisis fluctuations in the sensitivities to US monetary policy were driven by transitory behavioural factors. By contrast, the post-crisis fluctuations in the sensitivities to global risk conditions were primarily driven by persistent creditor compositional factors.====The third set of key results pinpoints the main determinants of the post-crisis shifts in sensitivities. The increased post-GFC sensitivity to US monetary policy is shown to be attributed to a higher degree of monetary policy convergence among advanced economies in the years following the GFC, with US monetary policy serving as a stronger indicator of global monetary policy trends. This effect began to unwind as the monetary policies of major advanced economies started to diverge in 2013. Meanwhile, the decline in the sensitivity to global risk occurred mainly as a result of a post-crisis shift in the composition of global lenders: the better-capitalized national banking systems, which tend to be less responsive to global risk conditions, significantly increased their market share.====These results have important implications for global liquidity flows. First, the finding that the post-GFC increases in sensitivities to US monetary policy were driven largely by the unusual convergence in advanced economy monetary policies suggests that they were largely a transitory phenomenon. This result also implies that greater cross-country business cycle (and, consequently, monetary policy) synchronization would make the stabilisation of international capital flows more challenging. Second, the finding that the overall decline in the sensitivity of international bank flows to global risk conditions was due to increases in the lending market shares of better-capitalized banking systems, which are themselves less responsive to global risk, suggests that the post-GFC regulatory reforms had the additional benefit of stabilising international capital flows.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review relevant findings of the existing literature on global liquidity and its drivers. We describe the data in Section 3. We estimate the sensitivities to global factors and their post-crisis shifts in Section 4. In Section 5, we decompose these shifts into behavioural components and compositional components.

This process provides debt relief for the sovereign and partially compensates lenders for their losses. In the data, the bulk of such debt relief is implemented by extending the maturity of the debt rather than changing its face value. We augment a standard maturity choice model with a post-default renegotiation phase and study whether it can replicate this observed maturity extension. The model is successful in generating this and other key features of renegotiations and maturity choice, but critically only when we assume that sovereigns continue to be excluded temporarily from financial markets after renegotiation, consistent with the observation that countries do not immediately resume borrowing. In contrast, a version of the model where market access is restored promptly features a counterfactual reduction in maturity, a puzzle for the standard model.","Emerging markets are vulnerable to debt crises which often result in outright default. Recently, similar dynamics proved relevant for the European Union “periphery” including Euro Area members such as Spain and Greece. One option in the policy-makers' toolkit is the active management of the maturity structure of the debt, over the business cycle and in the run-up of crises. Broner et al. (2013) document that emerging markets issue shorter-term debt when financial conditions worsen. A relatively recent quantitative literature on maturity choice (e.g. Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012), Hatchondo et al. (2016), Sánchez et al. (2018)) studies the trade-offs faced under endogenous default risk, yet much less is known about the maturity structure determined as part of the bond swaps used to resolve default episodes. These swaps implement new terms for the lenders by replacing the old bonds, on which the sovereign stopped making payments, with new obligations with a new face value and maturity structure. This restructuring process is a necessary but not sufficient first step towards regaining access to international financial markets. In parallel, a body of largely empirical work has focused on the haircuts suffered by lenders. It relates bond-level and aggregate haircuts to debt relief, the length of market exclusion, and yields following the eventual return to markets. The comprehensive account of Cruces and Trebesch (2013) concludes that ==== is the main mechanism for debt relief: bond swaps reduce overall indebtedness, yet a greater share of the debt takes the form of long-term bonds compared to the composition of debt at the time of default. This suggests that maturity choice during restructuring is of vital importance for understanding the resolution of default episodes, the reduction in debt burden, and lenders' eventual compensation.====We provide a quantitative analysis of the resolution of default crises via bond swaps and the incentives that lead countries to negotiate maturity extensions. This requires a joint characterization of maturity choice both at issuance, during normal market access, and as part of the restructuring process. The resulting model brings together separate but inherently related strands of the literature on sovereign debt: it embeds Yue (2010)’s Nash bargaining setup, for the resolution of default episodes, in the standard maturity choice model, e.g. Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012). While in good credit standing the sovereign can issue both short- and long-term debt and the eventual renegotiations following default alter both the maturity structure of the debt as well as its overall level. We assume lenders are risk-neutral and competitive, resulting in bond prices that are actuarially fair. As standard in this class of models, we focus on Markov equilibria, so that the sovereign lacks commitment over future default decisions and debt issuance behavior. Default is potentially desirable because it supports higher levels of consumption, due to the suspension of debt service payments, but costly because it leads to temporary financial autarky and an exogenous loss of income, which captures in reduced-form any real costs or disruptions caused by default. The model's success in generating the maturity extension in the data hinges critically on the inclusion of a post-renegotiation market exclusion spell. The absence of new issuance immediately following renegotiations is a ubiquitous feature of the data, which we interpret through the lens of the model as evidence of continued market exclusion. Using the dataset compiled by Cruces and Trebesch (2013) we find that, on average, countries are excluded for roughly 3 years prior to restructuring and an additional 4 afterwards. These estimates are not sensitive to the definition of market re-access and outliers.====The post-renegotiation exclusion is essential for inducing maturity extension because it calls for the sovereign to resume debt service payments before it is able to tap international markets again: with short-term debt, the sovereign risks having to make relatively large principal payments without the option to roll them over, which is costly from a consumption-smoothing point of view. Instead, with long-term debt the sovereign makes a smooth sequence of relatively small payments. The intuition here mirrors the interaction of maturity with roll-over risk emphasized by Bocola and Dovis (2020), but rather than concerning the risk of markets “shutting down” in a self-fulfilling manner, here the sovereign risks delays in reentry.====In the version of the model with immediate reentry there is no such risk of continued exclusion and consideration related to debt dilution dominate instead: after renegotiations debt and default risk are low and the relatively impatient government starts accumulating debt fast. Expectations of eventual high indebtedness depress current long-term bond prices and make compensating defaulted lenders using such instruments costly. This is a manifestation of the inefficiency inherent in dilutable long-term debt, as discussed by e.g. Hatchondo et al. (2016). In this setting defaults are settled with mostly short-term debt, which the country can roll over, but which does not suffer from dilution.====The takeaway from the analysis of these two environments is that maturity choice in renegotiation is shaped by the same forces in play during normal market access, namely a tension between consumption smoothing, the hedging benefit of long-term debt, and debt dilution. In the empirically-relevant case of post-renegotiation exclusion, extending maturity supports consumption smoothing for the country while its downside, dilution, is kept in check temporarily by the government's inability to resume borrowing immediately.====Our project is related to all work on emerging market long-term debt and maturity choice but most closely to two recent papers. In terms of theory, Aguiar et al. (2019) study a standard maturity choice model and prove that inaction in secondary markets as well as no further issuance of long-term debt are optimal in their environment, where the sovereign is paying down an exogenous initial stock of debt. Their stark result reflects the choice of shocks facing the sovereign, in particular abstracting from the income dynamics common in quantitative work. Their findings rationalize why buy-backs in secondary markets are uncommon and why they are unlikely to improve the country's overall position, cf. Bulow and Rogoff (1988). Quantitatively, Dvorkin et al. (2018) also study renegotiation, but do so within the maturity choice framework of Sánchez et al. (2018). They consider a rich quantitative model augmented with several extensions, including portfolio adjustment costs and exogenous sudden-stop shocks. They share our focus on maturity extension and list four ingredients that contribute to their model's ability to generate it: lenders' aversion to face-value haircuts (possibly due to balance sheet and regulatory concerns), post-renegotiation exclusion, debt dilution, and income dynamics around default events. In their model, renegotiations are modeled as an alternating-offers bargaining game. In contrast, here we identify a puzzle in the standard, workhorse maturity choice model in the literature and offer a minimal resolution by arguing that post-renegotiation exclusion is sufficient to replicate the extension in the data.====In generating the maturity extension behavior found in the data, we have abstracted from several recent developments in the sovereign default literature, chiefly production and an endogenous cost of default as in Mendoza and Yue (2012), the possibility of self-fulfilling crises following Cole and Kehoe (2000), lender risk-aversion or richer pricing kernels, e.g. Lizarazo (2013) or Aguiar et al. (2016), capital and investment, e.g. Gordon and Guerron-Quintana (2018), or foreign reserves, e.g. Bianchi et al. (2018), to name but a few. These extensions likely have first-order consequences for the choice of maturity at issuance and during renegotiation. We cannot rule out that one or some combination of them could induce the maturity extension behavior observed in the data. We model negotiations by following Yue (2010), using a cooperative game theory solution concept, in contrast to some of the recent work using non-cooperative bargaining, as in Benjamin and Wright (2011) and more recently Asonuma and Joo (2020) and Dvorkin et al. (2018). One final noteworthy omission from the model is abstracting from involvement by international financial institutions (IFIs) and conditionality, as discussed by Boz (2011) and more recently by Fink and Scholl (2016). Emerging markets borrow from IFIs intermittently but these could potentially play an important role in renegotiations and during debt crises. In the case of the Greece 2012 event, the European Commission was actively involved in the restructuring process, as discussed in Zettelmeyer et al. (2013).====One key challenge in the study of maturity choice and long-term debt more broadly is the poor convergence properties of this class of models, across a wide range of numerical methods and strategies. Here we follow Dvorkin et al. (2018) and Gordon (2019) and use discrete choice methods. Conceptually they are similar to Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012)’s iid income shocks with continuous support, as they induce a comparable “randomization” across issuance choices in a way that loosens the tight interconnection between bond prices and issuance policies, but do so in a more tractable way and with more modest computational requirements. Appendix A reviews the method and details its use here.====We calibrate the model to Greece and its 2012 restructuring event, as well as key findings in a broader sample of events, detailed in Section 2. The behavior we aim to replicate is robustly observed across most if not all default episodes, at least since the early 1990s. The Greece 2012 event has the advantage of readily available high quality data on cash flows prior to and following the bond swap as well as haircuts at the instrument level, provided by Zettelmeyer et al. (2013). The parameter values resulting from the calibration are comparable with those reported in reference papers on maturity choice, suggesting that the results here carry over to a broader set of countries and circumstances.====The calibrated model mirrors the behavior of debt maturity in the data, both in terms of choice at issuance and regarding the lengthening of maturity during restructuring. In the data, maturity increases from 6.4 to 8.2 years (measured as Macaulay (1938) duration) while the benchmark model has maturity increasing on average from 6.4 to 10 years. The key assumption supporting this positive result is the inclusion of a post-renegotiation exclusion spell. Absent this feature, we find that a version of the model with immediate market reentry would instead induce a reduction in the maturity of debt, from 7.6 to 5.4 years. In addition to replicating the maturity extension, the model is consistent with the data more broadly: the haircuts applied to lenders following renegotiation are close to the values observed in the Greece 2012 event, an overall 65% haircut with substantial heterogeneity across maturities, debt-to-GDP in the 50% range, a countercyclical trade balance, and consumption more volatile than income. Moreover, model spreads are somewhat low in level and volatility compared to standard emerging market values, but comparable with the Greece data. In the model this is due in part to the mix of recovery and risk-neutral lenders. Hatchondo et al. (2016) assume a richer pricing kernel and can generate greater spread levels and volatility, in a similar model, albeit with exogenous recovery and no change in maturity upon restructuring.====There is one dimension in which the model has some difficulty in matching the data, the average share of short-term debt in total (i.e. the average maturity structure). To address this, in the benchmark specification we introduce a small adjustment cost that penalizes deviations of maturity from a target, average value. This cost breaks indifference over maturity choice in states of the world in which borrowing is essentially risk-free. We document that the maturity extension and the quantitative features of the model do not rely on the presence of this adjustment cost, by reporting calibrations of the benchmark model and the model with immediate reentry where this cost has been eliminated.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 will summarize key stylized facts about restructuring of sovereign debt and maturity choice, Section 3 lays out the structure of the model and the definition of equilibrium, Section 4 contains the quantitative analysis of the model, both the benchmark version with post-renegotiation exclusion and a version with immediate market reentry, while Section 5 concludes.

This finding is confirmed in an extended model where we allow a set of policy variables (financial development, human capital, competition policy, and knowledge stock) to affect absorptive capacity, none of which induce permanent growth effects. The proxies for financial development and knowledge stock stand out for their significant level effects.","Output per capita shows enormous and persistent differences across countries. As variations in factor inputs are unable to explain these differences, there is an important role for disparities in total factor productivity (TFP). The relative importance of TFP vis-à-vis factor accumulation for economic growth has occupied economists not least since Tinbergen (1942), Abramovitz (1956) and Solow (1956). The traditional neoclassical growth model leaves TFP unexplained and, in the famous words of Edward Denison (1967, 282), assumes that “[b]ecause knowledge is an international commodity, [we] should expect the contribution of advances of knowledge to be about the same size in all the countries.” Much of the early endogenous growth literature relates a country's TFP growth rate to its research efforts. The implication of this type of single-country model without international spillovers is long-run divergence of incomes across countries, given that countries with higher research efforts should permanently leave all others behind. However, this prediction seems at odds with the available data on cross-country income differences. Situated in-between the neoclassical and single-country endogenous growth models are the multicountry endogenous growth models of Eaton and Kortum (1999), Howitt (2000), and Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare (2005), among others. These models are in the neoclassical tradition, in that economic growth in steady state is equal for all countries (thanks to knowledge spillovers), but they also capture some of the defining features of endogenous growth models since differences in innovation efforts among countries are important for steady state ==== of TFP.==== In this strand of the literature, TFP is given the interpretation of successfully assimilated (‘absorbed') global technology. What unites concepts such as absorptive capacity and alternatives — e.g. social capability (Abramovitz, 1986) — is the notion that despite the designation of knowledge as a public good or being in the public domain, technological catch-up is by no means guaranteed, but requires considerable efforts and investments (see Parente and Prescott, 1994, Parente and Prescott, 2002; Aghion and Jaravel, 2015, among others).==== Related work by Benhabib and Spiegel (1994, and 2005) builds on and extends the Nelson and Phelps (1966) model which assigns a central role for human capital in the knowledge diffusion process: instead of playing the role of a (mere) factor input such as in Mankiw et al. (1992), among many others, human capital is suggested to facilitate knowledge diffusion. Here the implication is that an increase in average education levels (proxying absorptive capacity) leads to a permanent increase in TFP ====.====In the el growth literature there is a long tradition of quantifying ‘foreign’ elements of TFP by assuming specific channels through which international knowledge spillovers can occur and/or pinpointing country characteristics deemed synonymous with absorptive capacity. The most prominent channels are arguably the patterns of international trade, foreign direct investment and international migration (Coe and Helpmann, 1995, Pottelsberghe and Lichtenberg, 2001; Madsen, 2007; Acharya and Keller, 2009; Bahar et al., 2014; Bosetti et al., 2015; Fracasso and Marzetti, 2015; see also Keller, 2004, Keller, 2010 for detailed surveys] international. Human capital (Griffith et al., 2004; Benhabib and Spiegel, 2005; Madsen et al., 2010; Ertur and Musolesi, 2017) and investment in R&D (Aghion and Howitt, 1998; Griffith et al., 2003; Mancusi, 2008; Lu et al., 2017) are frequently employed as proxies for absorptive capacity. While a priori all of these factors and channels are likely to be relevant to capture the discovery and assimilation of ideas developed elsewhere, estimates are biased if the proxies included are correlated with other, omitted determinants. This criticism points to recent efforts to quantify the quality of management or productivity-enhancing investment in ==== capital, of which formal R&D is only one element (see e.g. Acharya, 2016; Bloom et al., 2016; Corrado et al., 2017). Moreover, Eberhardt et al. (2013) argue that the empirical literature on knowledge spillovers following the seminal contribution by Coe and Helpmann (1995) suffers from an omitted variable bias induced by spillovers and common shocks with heterogeneous impact. They show that private returns to R&D are dramatically lower once this type of cross-sectional correlation is taken into account.====The present paper takes a different approach. We specify a Cobb-Douglas production function that parameterizes unobserved total factor productivity as a global technology process interacted with country-specific absorptive capacity that varies stochastically over time. We demonstrate that our econometric specification is a generalization of the multicountry endogenous growth model referred to above. To identify unobserved global technology, we extend Pesaran's (2006) common correlated effects (CCE) approach to a setup where factor loadings evolve according to random walks. Written in state space representation, the model can be estimated using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. This produces time-varying country-specific indices for absorptive capacity that do not rely on ad hoc proxies or impose explicit channels through which knowledge spills over but encompass all of these. We show how the relevance of time variation in absorptive capacities can be tested as part of the implementation using the stochastic model specification search of Frühwirth-Schnatter and Wagner (2010). This allows us to test the differential implications of alternative theoretical growth models about whether improvements in absorptive capacity have growth or merely level effects.====We also estimate an extended model including observed country characteristics that are believed to affect absorptive capacity. This more general specification maintains the flexibility of the baseline approach yet allows absorptive capacity to be driven by both an unobserved stochastic component and observed (policy) variables. We will focus on a set of variables highlighted in the recent Schumpeterian growth literature dominating the current debate on policy for economic growth: financial development, human capital, competition policy and the R&D knowledge stock.====We estimate our baseline model for a panel of 31 countries covering the period 1953–2014. The choice of sample countries is driven by our desire to capture the technology diffusion and absorption process ====, including economies such as the United States which have been at the frontier throughout this period, as well as others such as South Korea or Taiwan, which have experienced impressive catch-up growth. Our first finding is that there is relevant time variation in absorptive capacities. Especially countries like Ireland, South Korea and Taiwan have been able to increase their ability to assimilate foreign knowledge over the sample period. Second, changes in absorptive capacity are ==== found to have permanent growth effects, but merely to affect the level of TFP.====Our third finding relates to the country-specific evolution of absorptive capacity, which can be squared with policy levers to promote innovation and technical change====: We estimate an extended model using a reduced panel of 21 countries for which we have indicators of financial development, human capital, competition policy/regulation, and R&D expenditure over the period 1970–2009. In line with the baseline model, none of these variables induces permanent ==== effects. In our results financial development has a strong positive effect on absorptive capacity, yet is subject to diminishing returns, echoing the “too much finance” argument in recent work on economic growth (Arcand et al., 2015). Moreover, R&D stock is found to contribute substantially to our measure of absorptive capacity in line with arguments for the ‘two faces of R&D' (Griffith et al., 2004).====The remainder of this study is structured as follows. Section 2 sets out the baseline empirical specification, demonstrates how it can be squared with a multicountry endogenous growth model and outlines the Bayesian simulation-based method that will be used to estimate the model. The data along with the empirical results are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4 we present and estimate an extended model that allows absorptive capacity to be driven by both an unobserved stochastic component and observed variables.

"Bombardini Matilde,Li Bingjing","UBC, CIFAR and NBER, Canada,National University of Singapore, Singapore","Received 7 May 2019, Revised 5 March 2020, Accepted 5 March 2020, Available online 31 March 2020, Version of Record 22 April 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2020.103321,Cited by (69),Did the rapid expansion of Chinese exports between 1990 and 2010 contribute to the country's worsening ,"Among the many dimensions of China's economic growth in the last 3 decades is the contemporaneous boom in export performance: the annual export growth rate was 14% during the 1990s and 21% during the 2000s. This rapid economic growth has been accompanied by concerns that many of the benefits deriving from higher incomes may be attenuated by the similarly rapid deterioration in the environment and increase in pollution.==== This paper studies how the export boom in China between 1990 and 2010 affected pollution and infant mortality across different Chinese prefectures. The specific question we tackle is whether areas that were more involved in the export boom witnessed a deterioration or improvement in pollution and health outcomes relative to less exposed areas. This is ex ante unclear as an export boom brings about more production and therefore pollution (the “scale” effect in Copeland and Taylor, 2003), but also higher incomes, which may affect both pollution and health outcomes in the opposite direction.====We capture these potentially opposite channels through two export exposure shocks. For each Chinese prefecture we construct: (i) ====, which represents the pollution content of export expansion and is measured in pounds of pollutant per worker; (ii) ====, which measures the dollars per worker associated with export expansion. The variable ==== measures the extent to which a prefecture is initially specialized in industries that subsequently experience a large export increase. The variable ==== captures the interaction of export expansion and pollution intensity: prefectures with larger initial employment in industries that both experience large export shocks ==== have high emission intensity are expected to become more polluted. The two measures differ because prefectures specialize in different products and while two prefectures may experience the same export shock in dollar terms, the one specializing in a polluting sector, like steel, experiences a larger ====.====There are two key features of these measures. First, they rely on variation across prefectures in the initial pattern of comparative advantage across industries, similarly to the approach by Edmonds et al. (2010), Topalova (2010), Kovak (2013) and Autor et al. (2013) to study the effects of import competition on employment. The second feature is that, differently from these studies, here we are interested in the effect on China of the ==== demand shock generated by the rest of the world. The paper therefore builds an export expansion measure that captures the portion of China's export increase that is predicted by the change in tariffs faced by Chinese exporters over time in different sectors.====Why are we interested in this specific component of export and of output growth more in general? In general, production for both domestic consumption and exporting responds to a multitude of shocks. These include the ==== supply shocks, like productivity innovations and institutional changes, as well as demand-side shifters, each of which may affect emissions differently. Were we to simply consider the correlation between emissions and output, we would not be able to easily interpret it. The paper therefore focuses on a specific dimension of aggregate demand where this identification problem is alleviated. It makes use of the presence of externally imposed tariffs, thus isolating foreign demand shocks from other unobserved sources of output dynamics.====We employ the shift-share approach, instead of actual export expansion, to identify the causal relationship running from tariff-predicted export expansion to local environmental and health outcomes. At the ====, there could be numerous supply shifters that simultaneously affect export performance and environmental/health outcomes. For example, a weakening in the enforcement of environmental regulations may increase local exports by reducing production costs, but this may also lead to environmental degradation and worsening health outcomes. By ==== employing export growth at the local level, but rather using a weighted average of national export expansion with the weights determined by the initial industry composition, the shift-share design helps purging such potential confounding factors.====Magnitudes are substantial. We find that a one standard deviation increase in ==== increases infant mortality by an additional 4.1 infant deaths per one thousand live births, while a one standard deviation increase in ==== decreases infant mortality by a statistically insignificant 1.2 infant deaths.==== The size of these effects has to be gauged in the context of the evolution of infant mortality over this period. In our data, between 1990 and 2010 infant mortality rate in China went from 36 per thousand to 5 deaths per thousand live births, but this decline hides substantial heterogeneity. Between 2000 and 2010 for example, the 75th percentile prefecture experienced a decline of 23.7 deaths, while the 25th percentile prefecture saw a drop of only 8.7 deaths. The effect of ==== not only is insignificant, but is only equivalent to 6.6% of such standard deviation.====In two different exercises we calculate the overall effect of the two shocks and illustrate that both at the national level and at the provincial level export expansion had primarily a negative effect, i.e. very few prefectures had a net improvement in health outcomes. Ignoring a potentially beneficial effect of trade common to all prefectures that our cross-prefecture approach necessarily nets out, we calculate that an extra 803,088 infant deaths during the 1990–2010 period are due to export expansion. Importantly, using the same data as Chen et al. (2013), we can show that the negative effects of trade on health are concentrated in mortality due to cardio-respiratory conditions, which are the most sensitive to air pollution, corroborating our findings.====How do ==== and ==== affect mortality? The next question we tackle is the quantification of the channels through which these two shocks influence health outcomes. The most intuitive way in which ==== affects mortality is through pollutant concentration. Instead ==== may affect mortality through different channels.==== Our identification relies on the assumption that conditional on ====, ==== affects mortality only through the channel of air pollution. We show that a positive ==== increases the concentration of ====, while ==== tends to reduce it. In the decade 2000–2010 a one standard deviation increase in ==== increases ==== concentration by 6.3 ====/==== while a one standard deviation increase in ==== decreases ==== concentration by 2.1 ====/==== (this latter effect is not statistically significant). These changes represent respectively 19% and −6.3% of the standard deviation of ==== concentration change during 2000–2010.==== We have two possible explanations for the lack of a strong income effect of export expansion on both mortality and pollution. The first one has to do with the fact that environmental policy is set centrally in China and local increases in income may not directly translate into local changes in policy.==== The second potential explanation is based on other consequences of income growth that may be associated to increased pollution, such as the increase in vehicle ownership (see Dargay et al., 2007).====Finally, the paper shows how pollution affects infant mortality, a link which has been studied in the previous literature, but for which we offer a novel identification strategy. We find the elasticity of infant mortality to ==== to be 0.81. This is quantitatively similar to the estimate by Tanaka (2015) of 0.82 for China (albeit during a different time period). The elasticity of IMR to ==== is 1.9.====We are careful in addressing a series of issues that may affect confidence in these results. Importantly, like all studies employing a shift-share approach, our paper faces the challenge of establishing that the results are not simply due to the initial pattern of industrial specialization. It is plausible for example to hypothesize that prefectures initially specialized in dirty industries would experience a relative increase in mortality over this period even without export shocks. This issue is at the heart of Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018), who emphasize how, with Bartik-style variables, identification relies on the exogeneity of the initial industry shares. We calculate Rotemberg weights as proposed by Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018) in Appendix F.2, and show that: i) they are less concentrated in a few industries relative to Autor et al. (2013) and ii) there are no pre-trends in infant mortality associated with the employment share of high Rotemberg weights industries. We also perform the “balance” checks proposed under the alternative identification assumptions discussed by Borusyak et al. (2018) and show that at the industry level, pollution embodied in exports is uncorrelated with industry-specific weighted average of other local shocks such as changes in educational attainment, health expenditure proxies etc. Aside from these formal checks, in the paper we also control for pre-existing trends and present placebo tests as customary in this literature.====Because concerns about initial industrial specialization are so important for the identification and quantification at the core of this paper, in what follows we present a graphical exercise that serves two purposes. First, it addresses in an intuitive way the key concern that having a high employment share in a dirty industry is entirely responsible for the subsequent increase in infant mortality, regardless of trade shocks. Second, it illustrates the basic nature of the exercise, which is analogous to a continuous difference-in-differences as clarified by Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018). Simply having high employment shares in dirty industries is not enough to predict a high increase in mortality. A prefecture must have a high employment share in an industry that has ==== high emission intensity and high trade exposure. Even though we present all data details later, we construct a measure that simply classifies sectors according to two criteria: dirty/clean (D and C) and high-export-growth/low-export-growth in the decade 2000–10 (H and L).==== We then obtain employment shares in 2000 for each prefecture in each of the 4 groups of industries (CH, DH, CL and DL). Panel A of Fig. 1 plots the change in infant mortality rate (IMR) for each prefecture in 2000–2010 against the following relative employment ratio in the year 2000:====Fig. 1 shows that IMR increased in prefectures that initially had a relatively higher employment in dirty industries that ==== saw high export growth in 2000–10. Conversely, Panel B of Fig. 1 presents the same change in IMR against the analogous employment ratio for low-export-growth industries:====Fig. 1 shows that initial specialization in dirty sectors does not predict change in infant mortality rate when we focus on low export growth industries.====The paper reports a number of other checks to probe our results. For example, we address the potential objection that official sources for data on pollution may misreport pollutant concentrations in order to hide imperfect compliance with environmental regulation from the public. In this regard we check the correlation of the official daily pollution levels with the levels reported by the American Embassy and Consulates in five Chinese cities. We show that the correlation is above 94%. Another issue that we delve on is the quantitative importance of trade policy shocks for the overall structure of production and level of pollution. We take a specific episode, the steel safeguard tariffs imposed by the US in 2002–2003 to show that, for prefectures with heavy steel production, pollution decreases relative to control prefectures in 2001 and increases back up in 2003.==== Finally, we check the robustness of our results to alternative measures of export shocks that take into account shocks in neighboring and upwind prefectures, import shocks, input-output linkages that transmit foreign demand shocks to upstream industries, and control for local energy production among other socio-economic determinants of mortality and pollution. We also analyze the results by gender and by age, finding a relatively homogeneous effect across different groups.","Trade, pollution and mortality in China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300404,31 March 2020,2020,Research Article,182.0
Farrokhi Farid,"Purdue University, USA","Received 28 May 2018, Revised 14 March 2020, Accepted 16 March 2020, Available online 24 March 2020, Version of Record 8 April 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2020.103323,Cited by (11),This paper develops a multi-country ==== model that incorporates crude oil global sourcing by refineries and refined oil demand by downstream ==== that are connected through ,"Trade in oil accounts for a large share of world trade, but occupies a small part of the trade literature. The literature on international trade has included the oil industry only in multi-sector frameworks designed for manufacturing rather than natural resources. The fields of industrial organization and energy economics lack a general equilibrium framework to put the oil industry into global perspective. Both the specifics of this industry and a general equilibrium analysis must come together to address trade-related questions about oil markets.====This paper develops a general equilibrium framework to study how changes in oil markets, such as a boom in U.S. crude oil production, affect oil prices and trade flows across the world. Specifically, I use the framework to examine a few key applications. First, I study the extent to which crude oil markets behave as one integrated global market. To do so, I explore how much a shock to crude oil production of a source changes the relative prices of crude oil across the world geography. Second, to demonstrate how the model can be used to evaluate policy, I examine the implications of lifting the ban on U.S. crude oil exports. This exercise asks: how much does the price of U.S. crude oil rise when it can be sold in global markets? What distributional gains does it create between crude oil suppliers, refineries as consumers of crude oil, and downstream consumers of refined oil? Lastly, I study the welfare implications of ceasing international trade between countries or regions of the world. I compare my results with benchmarks in the literature to shed light on the importance of oil trade and consumption for gains from trade.====To address these questions, I develop a model of crude oil global sourcing by refineries and refined oil demand by downstream users. Heterogeneous refineries decide which international suppliers to select and how much crude oil to purchase from each. Global trade in crude oil and supply of refined oil are the endogenous outcomes of the aggregation of refineries' sourcing and production. Refined oil demand is generated by final consumers as well as downstream industries that are connected through international trade and input-output linkages in the style of Caliendo and Parro (2015). The framework is designed for a medium-run horizon in which crude oil production flows and incumbent refineries are taken as given, and equilibrium determines prices and quantities of all goods in the locations of supply and demand.====The production of crude oil is concentrated in a relatively small number of sources from where it flows to numerous refineries around the world. I document the main patterns of these flows by exploiting data on the imports of American refineries. In particular, (i) most refineries import from a few supplier countries, (ii) refineries with similar observable characteristics allocate their total crude oil purchases across suppliers in different ways.====I model refineries' procurement by focusing on the logistics of crude oil sourcing. Transport costs not only vary across space due to distance and location of infrastructure, but also fluctuate over time due to availability of tankers and limited pipeline capacity. Because of costs fluctuations, refineries –which operate continuously– lower their input costs when they spread their purchases across a greater number of suppliers. Offsetting this benefit, sourcing from each supplier creates fixed costs associated with establishing business relationships. The trade-off between these gains and fixed costs explains pattern (i).====Using the ==== characteristics of refineries and suppliers, I specify variable costs that a refiner faces to import from a supplier (including price at origin, distance effect on transport costs, and a cost-advantage for complex refineries). This specification alone fails to justify pattern (ii). To accommodate it, I introduce ==== variable costs of trade to the pairs of refiners and suppliers.====I then develop a new procedure to jointly estimate fixed and variables costs that refineries face in their international crude oil sourcing. The task has proved challenging because a refiner's buying decisions are interdependent, e.g. adding a supplier may lead to dropping other suppliers or purchasing less from them. This interdependency is absent from typical export participation models such as Melitz (2003) which could be dealt with by, for example, a Tobit formulation. In addition, on the import side, estimating a structural gravity equation at the firm level requires a strong timing assumption by which a firm learns about its unobserved components of variable trade costs only after selecting its suppliers, e.g. see Antràs et al. (2017).==== I depart from this timing assumption by deriving a likelihood function that combines data on whom refineries select and how much they buy from each. This likelihood function lets a refiner not only buy less from its higher-cost suppliers but also select them with lower likelihood from an econometrician's point of view. As a result, the estimation ==== identifies parameters that affect trade quantities and selections.====This methodological departure is crucial to my results. Either large diversification gains with large fixed costs or small diversification gains with small fixed costs could explain why refineries typically buy from a few suppliers. Compared to independent estimations of quantities and selections, my all-in-one estimation generates smaller gains from global sourcing and smaller fixed costs, and it delivers a largely better fit to data. There is information in selections about the elasticity of substitution across suppliers, which we miss if we estimate this elasticity using data on only quantities. There is also information in quantities about fixed costs, which we miss if we estimate fixed costs using data on only selections.====I embed the model of refineries' sourcing, with the parameter estimates, into a general equilibrium trade framework that features multiple industries, input-output linkages, and allows for a less-than-unity elasticity of demand for refined oil. I complete my empirical analysis by calibrating the framework to aggregate data from 2010 on 33 countries and 6 regions covering all flows of oil from production of crude to consumption of refined and using parameters from world input output database (WIOD). The popular method of exact hat algebra cannot be readily applied to this setup, because refineries' trading relationships endogenously change in response to price shocks. I develop a hybrid procedure to compute counterfactual equilibrium in which I solve oil-related variables in ==== and downstream variables in ====.====The estimated model fits well out of sample. While I use cross-sectional data from 2010 to estimate the model, I check its predictions for changes during 2010 to 2013. To do so, I re-calculate the equilibrium by updating crude oil production and refining capacity of all countries to their factual values in 2013. The new equilibrium gives a reasonable prediction compared with factual changes to prices of crude oil in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world, and the pass-through to the price of refined oil. In addition, the model closely predicts crude oil imports, number of suppliers, and total input purchases of refineries in the U.S. economy.====I use my framework as a laboratory to simulate counterfactual experiments. First, I focus on a counterfactual world where only U.S. crude oil production changes. Specifically, I consider a 36% rise in U.S. production corresponding to its rise from 2010 to 2013. The price of crude oil at refinery drops by 11.5% in the U.S., 10.4% in other countries of Americas, 9.8% in African countries, and on average 9.0% elsewhere. The production boom changes relative prices of crude oil spatially across countries to a modest degree which can be interpreted as the extent to which the behavior of crude oil markets deviates from an integrated global market. In particular, compared with Americas and Africa, countries in Europe, Russia, and part of Asia are less integrated with the U.S. market.====To show how the model can be used to study counterfactual policies I explore the implications of lifting the ban on U.S. crude oil exports. I find that had the ban been lifted when U.S. production rose from 2010 to 2013, average prices of U.S. crude oil would have risen by 4.05%, profits of U.S. refineries would have decreased by 6.97%, and American consumers would have faced a negligibly higher prices of refined oil. These changes translate to $7.49 billion increase in annual revenues of U.S. crude oil producers, and $7.76 billion decrease in annual profits of U.S. refineries. Furthermore, I compare the results of this experiment to the factual data after the US government lifted the ban in 2015. The model predictions of changes to US crude oil exports in 2010–13 are reasonably close to actual changes to US exports in 2015–18.====Lastly, I study the importance of oil trade and consumption for gains from trade. I find gains to U.S. consumers as the change to their real wages when trade in all goods between the U.S. and the rest of the world is prohibitive. I compare my results to a benchmark provided by Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014). This benchmark is appropriate since it is the same as the downstream part of my model, with crude oil to be part of mining and refined oil included in fuels. I find that gains from trade are notably larger here than those in the benchmark. By moving US to autarky, US real wage falls by 28.8% here compared to 8.0% in the benchmark.====In addition, my analysis highlights the importance of distinguishing between rents on natural resources and wages paid to labor. Such distinction is absent in widely used labor theories of trade. For example, I find that by moving US to autarky real GDP per capita would fall by 11.2% compared to 28.8% fall in real wage. The reason is the dramatic rise of oil prices, and hence, oil revenues in the US. Therefore, who receives the rents would be crucial for distributional welfare implications.====This paper fits into the literature on international trade in two broad ways. First, it closely relates to the literature on quantitative models of trade in intermediate goods. The seminal work of Eaton and Kortum (2002) and its extensions such as Caliendo and Parro (2015) address trade in intermediates at the level of country or industry. Several recent studies emphasize the importance of sourcing at the firm level in manufacturing or grid-cell level in agriculture to examine gains from input trade (Gopinath and Neiman, 2014; Halpern et al., 2015; Antràs et al., 2017; Blaum et al., 2018; Farrokhi and Pellegrina, 2019). I develop new tools that can be used to estimate sourcing models and other setups in which individual buyers face both discrete and continuous choices. I then apply this new estimation procedure as well as existing tools from the general equilibrium tradition in the trade literature to a carefully specified model of oil trade.====This carefully specified model serves two main purposes. First, it helps me exploit rich micro data on refineries' sourcing to identify parameters that control margins of crude oil imports. These parameters govern the extent to which refineries' location with respect to suppliers as well as their complexity and capacity constraints matter for transmission of price shocks in oil markets. In addition, the heterogeneity in variable costs of refineries' imports helps me identify the substitution elasticity across crude oil suppliers. This identification is key to examine how large gains from global sourcing are through the input-saving channel, and how a local supply shock affects relative prices of crude oil across the world geography.====Second, this microfoundation helps me conduct counterfactual exercises tightly connected to supply and demand variables in crude oil markets. For example, standard assumptions in existing multi-industry models attribute variations in cross-country crude oil production to labor productivity shifters, capture all frictions in crude oil trade by iceberg trade costs, and assume zero profits or constant markups in the oil industry. In contrast, this framework brings data on the magnitude and quality of crude oil production and trade flows, allows for an array of frictions in the logistics of crude oil imports, makes room for endogenous rents in the refining industry, and distinguishes between rents on crude oil resources and wages paid to workers.====On the methodological side, models of firms' sourcing, in contrast to typical models of export participation such as Melitz (2003), feature interdependent decisions for selecting suppliers. In explaining selections into import markets, Antràs et al. (2017) is the closest to my model of sourcing. While they allow for a more general structure of fixed costs, I allow for a richer specification of variable trade costs. I use this alternative specification to deal with a sample selection bias in estimating trade elasticity at the level of individual buyers. Another difference is that in Antràs et al. (2017) firms can largely grow by global sourcing, while in my model refineries face a limit to the amount they can produce. This difference highlights the medium-run horizon of my model as opposed to the long-run horizon of theirs.====The trade literature has studied manufacturing more than natural resources or agriculture. One well-known result that holds across benchmark trade models is that gains from trade are often small (Arkolakis et al., 2012). These small gains are at odds with the critical role of trade in natural resources. Results in this paper confirm that gains from oil trade are in comparison notably large. Trade in oil benefits net importers of crude oil as their production costs would increase in autarky due to higher oil prices. In addition, it can benefit large net exporters of crude oil as they would face lower oil prices, and so, receive lower oil revenues if they were in autarky. The gains countries receive from these channels are sizable because the elasticity of substitution between oil and other inputs is small, meaning that input-users can hardly substitute oil with other factors of production or intermediates.==== A recent study by Fally and Sayre (2018), which relies on similar mechanisms, also finds large gains from trade in commodities.====This study relates to a large body of economic research on the oil industry. A literature aims to identify causes and consequences of oil shocks using econometric techniques and time-series oil price data (Kilian, 2009; Hamilton, 2011). These papers do not incorporate a room for the geography of oil production or logistics of oil trade, and do not model economic decisions made by oil producers and consumers. My paper complements this literature by (i) studying oil prices and trade flows spatially across the geography of the world, and (ii) since I model economic decisions that underlie oil trade, I can explicitly address a wide set of counterfactual policies. This paper also complements a recent study by Çakir Melek et al. (2017) who employ a two-country DSGE model to examine the macroeconomic impact of the shale boom. Several papers study economics of refineries focusing only on U.S. market (Chesnes, 2015; Sweeney, 2015). I complement these studies by modeling, estimating, and solving for a general equilibrium incorporating the oil industry in ==== markets.",Global sourcing in oil markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219962030043X,24 March 2020,2020,Research Article,183.0

The worker-level comparative advantage across sectors and occupations determines both the direction and the magnitude of the effect of trade on labor market outcomes. I also find that trade liberalization during 2000–2007 significantly contributed to the decline in manufacturing employment and job polarization in high-income countries. In addition, the model shows that the China effect measured by a decline in trade costs with China and an increase in China's manufacturing productivity during 2000–2007 increased ==== in most countries.","This paper presents a general equilibrium framework for quantifying the distributional consequences of international trade for a large number of countries. Workers with different characteristics gain or lose from trade by a different amount and reallocate labor differently in response to changes in the trade environment. Although traditional trade theory predicts that lower trade barriers favor high-skilled workers in high-income countries and low-skilled workers in low-income countries through sector-level labor reallocation (i.e., the Stolper and Samuelson, 1941), this prediction is at odds with empirical evidence which paints a more complicated picture – see Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2003, Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2004, Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2007.====The focus of this paper is on the role of worker heterogeneity in the qualitative and quantitative impacts of trade on labor market outcomes. I present a quantitative general equilibrium trade model which highlights the importance of interaction between country-level and worker-level comparative advantages. Using this model, I quantify the effect of trade liberalization during 2000–2007 on labor market outcomes in 32 countries. The prediction of my model is starkly different from the Stolper-Samuelson prediction. The overall trade liberalization during 2000–2007 increased the skill premium in most countries of my sample regardless of their income levels.==== I also find that the rise of China in the global economy during 2000–2007, measured by a decline in trade costs with China and an increase in China's manufacturing productivity, also increased the skill premium in most countries. For example, the rise of China explains about 15.3% of the actual increase in the skill premium in the U.S. during the same time period.====In the model, trade is first driven by comparative advantage across countries based on standard forces such as productivity differences and relative factor endowments. Trade has differential effects on workers within a country because they have heterogeneous comparative advantages. I characterize the worker-level comparative advantage by assuming that workers draw idiosyncratic sector- and occupation-specific productivities conditional on their exogenously endowed educational type. Then they endogenously sort into a sector and occupation to maximize their incomes, as in the Roy (1951) model. At the general equilibrium of the model, this endogenous sorting of workers determines effective labor supply patterns for each country, which eventually affects the country-level comparative advantage.====I use this model to quantitatively investigate the effect of international trade on various labor market outcomes. Specifically, I focus on relative gains from trade across different educational types (====) and trade-induced ==== within worker types. The labor allocation pattern is potentially heterogeneous across worker types due to their comparative advantage for sectors and occupations. Also, the model can quantify the effect of international trade on sector or occupation wage premia.====This paper highlights three underlying mechanisms through which trade affects labor market outcomes qualitatively and quantitatively. First, the between-type comparative advantage for workers determines the direction of the effect of trade on labor market outcomes. In other words, the same trade shock generates qualitatively different impacts across worker types depending on each type's comparative advantage. I analytically and quantitatively show that this mechanism can generate pervasive increases in the skill premium across many countries regardless of country-level comparative advantage, which is different from the traditional Stolper-Samuelson prediction. Second, the fact that workers have a comparative advantage not just across sectors but across occupations generates additional quantitative effects of trade on labor market outcomes by adding another layer of worker heterogeneity. Lastly, the within-type comparative advantage for workers determines how much wage responds to trade shocks, which in turn affects the quantitative magnitude of the effect of trade on between-educational-type inequality.====Using this model, I quantify the distributional effects of changes in the trade environment between 2000 and 2007 across 5 worker types defined by educational attainment, 4 sectors, and 5 occupation categories in 32 countries and the rest of the world. This time period is particularly interesting because international trade has become an increasingly significant factor since China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. I use international microdata gleaned from household surveys to quantify workers' differential responses to trade shocks in different countries.====I separately introduce two types of trade shocks to perform counterfactuals. I first measure trade shocks by changes in bilateral trade costs, which are calibrated to match normalized changes in bilateral trade flows in the data using the method provided by Head and Ries (2001). The calibration result shows that trade costs have decreased overall and primarily in the manufacturing sector between 2000 and 2007. I also separately look at the effect of changes in trade costs with China, since China has been on the rise in the global market during the time of interest. In addition, I quantify the trade impact from the increase in China's factor-neutral productivity in manufacturing.====The results from counterfactual experiments show that overall declines of bilateral trade costs between 2000 and 2007 increased between-educational-type inequality in most high-income countries and low-income countries with a comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector. For example, due to the decline in bilateral trade costs between 2000 and 2007, U.S. workers with advanced degrees had a 1.7% increase in welfare, whereas the welfare of high school dropouts in the U.S. increased by 0.9%.==== For China as another example, the counterfactual increase in welfare is 3.5% for workers with advanced degrees and 1.1% for high school dropouts. When between-educational-type inequality is measured by the skill premium, a decline in overall trade costs explains, 26.3% and 20.6% of the actual changes in the skill premium in the U.S. and China, respectively. The model also predicts that the decline in trade costs between 2000 and 2007 induced a significant contraction of manufacturing employment as well as job polarization in high-income countries.==== In contrast, the model shows that liberalized trade between 2000 and 2007 generated a contraction of agricultural employment in low-income countries such as China and a relative expansion of agricultural employment in Latin American countries. In addition, I explore the effect of the rise of China based on counterfactual simulations with calibrated changes in trade costs with China and China's manufacturing productivity during the same time period. I find that the rise of China increased between-educational-type inequality in most countries.====By considering limit cases of the benchmark model, I find evidence that the pervasive increase of the skill premium in response to lower trade costs is mainly driven by between-type comparative advantage for workers. The prediction from the alternative model without the between-type comparative advantage is similar to the traditional Stolper-Samuelson prediction. I also show that worker's comparative advantage across occupations generates on average 11.3% larger effects on the skill premium in addition to the effect generated by worker's comparative advantage across sectors.====The motivation for this paper stems from many previous empirical studies that document the relationship between trade and inequality: e.g., Autor et al., 2013, Autor et al., 2015 and Ebenstein et al. (2014) for developed countries, Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2003, Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2005 and Topalova (2007) for developing countries. I provide a structural model that complements the empirical findings of those papers. This paper is not the first to use a quantitative general equilibrium framework to examine trade-induced inequality in a large number of countries. Burstein and Vogel (2017) focus on the reallocation of factors across heterogeneous firms, and Parro (2013) focuses on capital-skill complementarity. Unlike these papers, I focus on workers' heterogeneous productivities and endogenous sorting as the key channels through which trade impacts inequality. In addition, this paper uncovers the effect of trade on both sector- and occupation-level labor reallocation within many countries.====Most importantly, this paper contributes to the fast-growing literature on the Roy-like assignment model with worker heterogeneity, by Lagakos and Waugh (2013), Hsieh et al. (2019), Burstein et al. (2019), and Galle et al. (2017). The closest contemporaneous papers to this paper are Burstein et al. (2019) and Galle et al. (2017). The former studies the U.S. economy focusing on equipment and occupations, and the latter focuses on sectors. This paper is distinct from the concurrent papers in three important ways. First, in this paper, workers have heterogeneous productivities across both sectors and occupations. I show quantitatively that worker's comparative advantage across both sectors and occupations generates a larger effect of trade on labor market outcomes than a model with only one dimension. Second, this paper quantifies a high-dimensional model of trade, worker heterogeneity, and labor reallocation with rich microdata from household surveys across a large number of countries instead of focusing on the outcome of a single country. Lastly, I estimate the key parameter – the labor supply elasticity – separately for different worker types and countries to account for heterogeneous wage distributions between worker types and countries.====The framework of this paper can be used to experiment with a wide range of trade liberalization episodes regarding changes in trade costs or partner countries' productivity. Generalizing Eaton and Kortum (2002) with heterogeneous workers, I provide a quantitative framework for theoretical foundations of workers' comparative advantage and trade studied by Ohnsorge and Trefler (2007) and Costinot and Vogel (2010). This model also differs from other papers which introduce worker heterogeneity to trade models based on the search and matching framework (Helpman et al. (2016)) or based on transitional dynamics (Artuç et al. (2010), Dix-Carneiro (2014), and Caliendo et al. (2019).) With the gravity structure that is in line with the welfare analysis of Arkolakis et al. (2012), the model remains quantitatively tractable by applying the technique of ‘hat’ algebra used by Dekle et al. (2008). The algorithm to solve the model is based on Alvarez and Lucas (2007) and Caliendo and Parro (2015), but with multiple factors– occupations. In this paper, I abstract from other potentially important mechanisms that have been explored in the literature such as trade in intermediate goods, input-output linkages, labor mobility frictions, or dynamic labor market adjustments, to better understand the role of worker heterogeneity in shaping the effect of trade on between-worker-type inequality.====The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, I develop a general equilibrium trade model with endogenous sorting of heterogeneous workers and derive welfare and distributional effects of trade. In Section 3, I discuss the quantitative strategy, including the estimation of parameters and the calibration of trade shocks. In Section 4, I present counterfactual results to discuss the effect of trade on labor market outcomes. Section 5 presents sensitivity analyses, and in Section 6 I conclude.","Trade, inequality, and the endogenous sorting ofheterogeneous workers",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300283,19 March 2020,2020,Research Article,184.0

It then uses China's 2001 accession to the ,"The real income of the top 0.1% of the population increased by 85.8% between 1993 and 2011 in the United States; the real income of the bottom 99% increased by only 5.8% over the same period.==== At the same time, the past several decades witnessed the fastest pace of globalization since the start of the First World War. Policymakers in advanced economies have focused on both of these patterns. The concentration of income at the top is of particular concern as it might hinder the welfare of the middle-class and lead to political polarization and instability. Specifically, top-income inequality is the key driver behind the rise of overall inequality, which further entails a wide range of economic and political repercussions from falling investment to political violence.==== Moreover, policymakers have been concerned that globalization has played an important role in generating unequal gains across the income distribution. Consequently, understanding the interplay of globalization and top income shares is becoming increasingly important to the design of public policies.====The existing literature does not provide a clear link between globalization and the runaway top income shares. Researchers working on the distributional effects of trade usually focus on wage inequality and especially on the “skill premium,” the wage difference between skilled and unskilled workers.==== However, the income of the top 0.1%—which usually consists of executive compensation, business profits, and capital gains—cannot be easily explained using the “skill premium.”====Complementing the literature on the skill premium, this paper examines how globalization shapes the income gap between the very rich and the rest of the population. We first document a novel empirical pattern: income gaps between the top executives and the average workers are higher among exporting firms than among non-exporting firms in the United States. We then provide direct evidence on this relationship using China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a trade shock: firms that benefit from lower trade barriers export more, grow larger, and grow more unequal. Motivated by the empirical findings, we develop a new model that incorporates occupational choice and executive compensation into a heterogeneous firms model of trade. The model reproduces the empirical patterns we documented at the firm level and generates income and firm size distributions that closely resemble the aggregate U.S. data. We then perform a quantitative assessment of the impacts of globalization on the CEO-to-worker pay ratio within a firm and on the top income shares within the country as a whole. The counterfactual simulation suggests that globalization can explain up to 44% of the surge in top 0.1% income shares in the U.S. between 1988 and 2008.====To establish a link between globalization and the income gap between the very rich and the rest, we create a new dataset that matches executive compensation to confidential U.S. Census micro data on payroll and international transactions. The resulting dataset focuses on publicly-listed firms and provides detailed information on executive compensation, employment, payroll, and export sales.==== We focus on the top executives because they constitute a large fraction of the top earners. Around 40% of the top 0.1% income earners in the U.S. are professional executives, and these 0.04% earners are responsible for about 4% of the national income (Bakija et al., 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first dataset assembled that can be used to study the relationship between international trade and the CEO-to-worker pay ratio.====With this new dataset, we document that globalization disproportionately benefits the top executives relative to the workers within the same firm. Specifically, the gap in compensation between the CEO and the average worker in the firm—the CEO-to-worker pay ratio—is 50% larger for exporting firms compared to domestic firms. This globalization premium for the CEO-to-worker pay ratio holds for manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms, for multinationals as well as exporters, for private as well as public firms, for comparisons across firms, and for comparisons within firms as they transition to exporting. As in the simplest Melitz (2003) model of trade, the impact of globalization is intermediated through firm size. We show that accounting for the firm-size channel is sufficient to explain the differential in CEO-to-worker pay ratios between exporters and non-exporters. One can imagine other channels — CEO skill premium for exporting or compensation for higher risk — that would increase the exporting CEO premium over and above what is implied by size. We do not find evidence of a meaningful premium in excess of that explained by size. Hence, our quantitative assessment focuses on the size channel.====We use China's 2001 accession to the WTO to provide direct evidence from a trade shock to firm exports, firm size, and CEO-to-worker pay ratios. Following its accession to the WTO, China gradually lowered import tariffs from an average of 15% in 2000 to 10% by 2007 (Lu and Yu, 2015). The tariff reductions potentially benefit firms with existing export links to China more than those without such existing relationships. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we compare a treatment group of firms with China-specific trading relationships prior to 2001 to control groups drawn from the remaining firms. We find that, in the aftermath of China's WTO accession, the firms in the treatment group exported 57% more, grew 40% larger in terms of employment and payroll, and grew 13% more unequal as measured by the CEO-to-worker pay ratio. These results suggest that globalization might be responsible for the widening income gaps between the rich and the poor through within-firm inequality.====To evaluate the aggregate implications of the firm-level findings, we develop a framework that bridges the heterogeneous firm trade model based on Melitz (2003) with the literature on occupational choice and executive compensation. The model world consists of two countries. Each country is populated by a fixed measure of individuals who are endowed with different levels of human capital. An individual chooses between different occupations, as in Lucas Jr (1978). She can either (1) create a new firm and become the founder and CEO of the firm or (2) work for an existing firm. If she chooses to create a new firm, her human capital determines the productivity of the firm, and her income depends positively on the size of the firm.==== If she chooses to be a worker, her human capital determines the amount of efficiency labor she supplies to the market. The wage rate of efficiency labor is determined in a competitive countrywide labor market and equalized across firms within the same country. In equilibrium, only the individuals with human capital above a certain threshold choose to create firms, while the majority of the population chooses to work for an existing firm. Each firm produces a distinct variety and sells it in a monopolistically competitive market. Firms can choose to export to the foreign market after incurring fixed costs.====The model replicates the new empirical pattern documented in this paper; in equilibrium, within-firm inequality is higher among the firms that sell to the foreign market. The key mechanism is that the extra profits earned in the foreign market are not distributed evenly within the same firm. The compensation paid to the CEO of a firm is linked to the sales of the firm, while the wage rate of a typical worker is determined in a countrywide labor market. Any extra profits earned in the foreign market benefit the CEO directly, but benefit the workers only through general equilibrium effects. In the end, as the firm sells to the foreign market, its within-firm inequality will be higher. At the aggregate level, trade creates a gap in within-firm inequality between the exporting and domestic firms. Consistent with the empirical patterns described above, in the model, the size of the firm solely determines the level of within-firm inequality; once the size is controlled for, the exporting status of a firm has no impact on its CEO-to-worker pay ratio.====Before using the model to quantify the impact of globalization on top income shares, we show that the model can parsimoniously and precisely characterize the U.S. income and firm distributions at the same time. Empirically, the U.S. income distribution is well approximated by an exponential distribution for the majority at the left end and a Pareto distribution for the right tail.==== At the same time, the U.S. firm size distribution can also be well described by a fat-tailed Pareto distribution (Axtell, 2001). These two distributions are captured simultaneously within the model by two assumptions: (1) human capital is distributed exponentially, and (2) firm productivity is an exponential function of the founder's human capital. The model then features a Pareto firm size distribution and a two-class-structured income distribution. The workers' wage depends on their human capital, which implies an exponentially distributed income outside of the very rich. The individuals at the right tail of the income distribution are the CEOs, whose income is linked to the size of the firm they manage. This implies that the right tail of the income distribution will follow the firm size distribution and thus be Pareto. Once the model is calibrated, it reproduces both the firm size and the income distribution observed in the data with reasonable precision.====Model counterfactuals suggest that trade liberalizations can explain 44% of the surge in the top 0.1% income shares in the United States between 1988 and 2008. To arrive at these values, we match one country in the model to the U.S. economy and the other to the rest of the world; we then calibrate their trade barriers and their relative TFP to match the data for each year. Targeting these moments alone, we compare the income distribution in the model to the income distribution in the data to quantify the potential explanatory power of our channel, linking globalization, firm size, and inequality. In other counterfactual exercises, we also study how income inequality responds to changes in trade barriers as we move from autarky to the observed level of trade openness. For 2008, this latter exercise roughly triples the CEO-to-worker pay ratio at the largest firms in the United States. At the aggregate level, this opening to trade skews the income distribution rightward: the top 0.1% income share increases from 11.8% to 12.6% between autarky and trade.====By linking globalization and top income shares, this paper contributes to the literature on the distributional effects of globalization and the discussion on rising income inequality in the United States. The majority of the existing research in the international trade literature focuses on how globalization affects wage inequality, and particularly the wage and income gap between skilled and unskilled workers.==== Top income inequality, such as the income gap between top managers and workers, or the overall top income shares, is often overlooked in the trade literature with a few exceptions.==== At the same time, researchers working on income inequality documented a pronounced surge of the income gaps between the top 1% and the bottom 99% in the data. Papers in this literature showed that a substantial part of the rise in U.S. top income inequality is due to the rise in labor income inequality, especially when business income is included in the category of labor income.==== This current paper bridges the gap between the two literatures by focusing on the impact of globalization on top income inequality. It is the first paper to show empirically that the access to the world markets increases CEO-to-worker pay ratio within the same firm, and thus that trade can potentially affect top income shares. This paper also quantitatively shows that a large part of the surge in top income shares in the United States can potentially be attributed to globalization. While our data can speak to the average compensation within the firm, we are unable to measure the skill composition and the organizational hierarchy within the firm. As a result, we are silent on how trade might have affected the CEO-to-worker pay ratio through these particular channels that are explored in Caliendo et al. (2015); Friedrich (2015); Burstein and Vogel (2017).====In broadening the focus to inequality between the very rich and the rest of the population, this paper complements an existing literature on inequality across executives. Monte (2011) and Meckl and Weigert (2011) developed models exploring the effects of trade on income inequality among the managers. By contrast, the model here is designed to generate a realistic income distribution that spans the entire population in general equilibrium, which has not been done before in the trade literature. This broader scope enables quantitative analysis of the aggregate impacts of globalization on income inequality, both within the right tail, and over the entire population.====By introducing Census data to the study of executive compensation, this paper also interfaces with the large literature on corporate governance and executive compensation (Roberts, 1956; Baker and Hall, 2004; Gabaix and Landier, 2008; Frydman and Saks, 2010). Compared to the existing literature, which mostly focuses on the level of executive compensation, the census data allow us both to measure the magnitude of executive compensation relative to the wages of ordinary workers within the same firm, and to do so on a large and comprehensive sample. In the process, we provide a new perspective to understand the implications of surging executive pay on inequality.==== This paper is also the first to study executive-to-worker pay ratio among privately-held firms. A small strand of this literature, such as Sanders and Carpenter (1998), Oxelheim and Randøy (2005), Cuñat and Guadalupe (2009), and Gerakos et al. (2009) documented that executive compensation in public firms increases as the firms start to participate in the global markets. This paper further documents that the positive link between executive compensation and globalization can also be observed at privately-held firms, though the magnitude is smaller.====Lastly, this paper is broadly related to the recent literature on between- and within-firm inequality (Song et al., 2018; Alvarez et al., 2018). While the literature mainly emphasizes the role of between-firm inequality in ==== measures of inequality, these very papers also highlighted the importance of within-firm inequality at the top of the distribution. Complementing this literature, we show that within-firm inequality is the primary channel through which globalization affects the ==== income shares.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical results. Section 3 presents the model and Section 4 focuses on the analytical results. Section 5 provides details of the calibration and quantitative results.

This trade-off is strongly diminished the higher the overlap in working hours between the headquarters and the affiliate. In order to rule out biases arising from confounding factors, I implement a regression discontinuity framework to show that the economic activity of a subsidiary located just across the time zone line which increases the overlap in working hours with its headquarters is, on average, roughly 1% higher on the knowledge intensity scale. The results are present only for foreign horizontal subsidiaries. Overall, the findings suggest that barriers to real-time communication within MNCs play an important role in the location decisions of their subsidiaries.","Arrow (1969) suggests that the transmission of knowledge is difficult and costly. It is reasonable to assume that these difficulties arise, in part, because effective knowledge transmission involves human interaction, which cannot be fully replaced with written words, nor be embedded in goods that can be shipped at low costs.==== A firm, as any other economic agent, faces difficulties when transferring knowledge among different divisions and affiliates, as has been extensively explored in the literature (e.g., Oldenski, 2012; Keller and Yeaple, 2013; Giroud, 2012; Gumpert, 2018). The ability of a multinational corporation (MNC) to transfer knowledge to its affiliates, however, should reflect the locations of the firm's headquarters and its subsidiaries.====This paper explores the role of time zones in the location decisions of knowledge-intensive activities of global firms using a highly detailed establishment-level ==== dataset on MNCs and make a number of contributions to the literature. First, I show a robust negative relationship between the knowledge intensity of MNCs' affiliates and the geographic distance to the headquarters which is significantly weakened the more overlap in working hours there are between the two parties. Second, I use a regression discontinuity design to exploit discrete spatial variation in time zones and show that subsidiaries located at roughly the same distance from their headquarters are active in economic activities significantly more knowledge intensive whenever they are located in a time zone closer to the headquarters. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time this methodology has been used in this context.====The empirical exercise in this paper is based on a sample of over 100,000 establishments belonging to over 3000 MNCs headquartered in over 100 countries, from the Worldbase dataset by Dun & Bradstreet.==== I focus my attention on both domestic and foreign subsidiaries of MNCs active in manufacturing activities. For each one of the subsidiaries in the sample I have information on their physical location and primary economic activity, as defined by the 1987 Standard Industry Classification (SIC), as well as its ownership structure. Using this dataset I study results grouping different types of affiliates based on their geographic location and economic activity relative to the MNC's headquarters: all affiliates (domestic plus foreign), foreign, (foreign) horizontal and (foreign) vertical. Domestic affiliates are those located in the same country as the MNC headquarters. Foreign affiliates are those located in a country other than the MNC headquarters. Foreign horizontal is the term I use for an affiliate located in a foreign country that replicates an economic activity of ==== domestic subsidiary of the same MNC. Accordingly, foreign vertical refers to those foreign affiliates that are upstream or downstream to economic activities associated with ==== domestic subsidiary based on a input-output relationship.====A novel source of variation this paper relies on is a industry-level knowledge intensity measure that I construct based on worker-level characteristics for each industry, as opposed traditional measures that rely on firms' balance-sheet data, such as R&D intensity. The index I use aims to capture the ==== knowledge intensity of an economic activity by averaging the accumulated experience and training of the workforce in an industry, using occupational characteristics defined in the O*NET project dataset.==== The main results, however, are robust to alternative industry-level measures of knowledge intensity.====After computing precise distances between each affiliate and its MNC global headquarters following a geocoding process using Google Maps, and using the knowledge intensity measures, I document a negative partial correlation between knowledge intensity and the distance between a headquarters and its subsidiaries. For example, everything else equal, the estimation in the paper implies that an American MNC headquartered in Houston TX in the United States would locate a meat packing subsidiary – an economic activity with low knowledge intensity levels – in Kabul in Afghanistan (approximately 12,000 km away from the headquarters) and a semiconductor plant – an economic activity with high levels of knowledge intensity – in Ireland (approximately 7000 km away from the headquarters).====This trade-off between distance and knowledge intensity cannot be explained using earlier frameworks that looked at the fragmentation of MNCs which, implicitly or explicitly, assumed zero marginal cost or costs orthogonal to distance of transferring knowledge between headquarters and subsidiaries (i.e., Helpman, 1984; Markusen, 1984; Brainard, 1993; Markusen et al., 1996; Markusen, 1997; Carr et al., 2001; Helpman et al., 2004; Markusen and Maskus, 2002).==== However, such trade-off would emerge from any model that incorporates the idea of marginal costs of transferring knowledge increasing in geographic distance. For example, Ramondo and Rodriguez-Clare (2013) study the gains from openness in a comprehensive model that includes both multinational production and trade, and assume that all multinational production activity entails iceberg type efficiency losses that vary across country pairs. This marginal cost, they assume, is an increasing function of geographical and cultural distance. Ramondo (2014) models multinational production where foreign subsidiaries face a combination of variable and fixed costs when relying on technology or knowledge from their headquarters, capturing the idea of limited span of control for the headquarters, thus generating a loss of productivity at the affiliate level. Arkolakis et al. (2013) model an economy in which countries specialize either in innovation or in production. When a country specializes in innovation it implies that its firms open production subsidiaries abroad with a marginal cost that affects their productivity. These marginal costs are meant to capture various impediments that multinationals face when operating in a different economic, legal or social environment, as well as the various costs of technology transfer incurred by multinationals in different production locations. Tintelnot (2017) presents a model of multinational production in which foreign plants engage in variable costs that are determined, in part, by distance between the headquarters and the location of the foreign subsidiary. Keller and Yeaple (2013) provide an explanation as to why the marginal cost of knowledge transmission increases with distance by modeling such costs as shipping costs for intermediate goods embedding headquarters services.==== In their model, shipping of intermediate goods is more prevalent for subsidiaries active in knowledge intensive activities.====This distance and knowledge trade-off, I show, is weakened when there is a larger overlap in working hours between the subsidiary and its headquarters. Thus, the cost of shipping intermediate goods, which would be just as relevant within the same time zone (because north-south shipping is equally as expensive as east-west shipping), is not enough to explain the fact that MNCs tend to locate geographically closer their subsidiaries active in knowledge intensive activities. That is, if ceteris paribus==== time zones affect the location decision of MNCs, then trade costs of intermediate goods cannot serve as a sufficient explanation for the “distance and knowledge” trade-off.==== The fact that time zones can play such an important role in this setting is consistent with the country-level evidence presented by Stein and Daude (2007), who show that foreign direct investment flows are partly explained by longitude-based distance.====In order to rule out other confounding factors driving the results, I estimate a regression discontinuity using discrete changes in the overlap of working hours across time zone lines around the globe. Using this methodology I find evidence that subsidiaries with a higher overlap in working hours with their headquarters are, on average, active in industries that are more intensive in knowledge. I find, however, that this discontinuity is present only for foreign horizontal affiliates and less so for other types of subsidiaries, a finding that I discuss more in detail when presenting the main results. In particular, the estimations using regression discontinuity find that the economic activity of a foreign subsidiary located just across a time zone line closer to the headquarters – thus increasing the overlap in working hours – is 0.6 to 0.84% higher on the knowledge intensity scale. The average effect of one more hour of overlap is equivalent to a reduction of about 200 km. between a headquarters and its foreign subsidiary, based on the estimated knowledge and distance trade-off. I further show that the discontinuity cannot be explained by observable determinants of the location decision of MNCs, and the results are robust to using different bandwidths, weights and alternative knowledge-intensity measures, such the industry-level R&D intensity.====An interpretation of the findings is that not all knowledge can be fully embedded in intermediate goods. Rather, location decisions of MNCs depend on aspects beyond transportation costs, such as the ease of communication between headquarters and foreign subsidiaries, in aspects related to management, monitoring, coordination, troubleshooting, etc. All these aspects crucial to MNCs are, arguably, forms of ==== knowledge, as they require human interaction (Arrow, 1969; Polanyi, 1962; Polanyi, 1966). In fact, the consensus in the existing literature on the economics of knowledge is that the transmission of knowledge is not immediate, and that knowledge diffusion strongly decays with distance.==== For instance, Jaffe et al. (1993) – among the first ones to make this claim – show that patent citations are more frequent within the same geographic area. Along the same lines, Keller (2002) showed that knowledge spillovers decrease with distance by looking at productivity changes as explained by foreign R&D investment. He documents that the half-life of such spillovers is 1200 km.==== In the context of MNCs, it has been shown distant foreign affiliates face a loss in efficiency which can be mediated by better connectivity (Giroud, 2012); that more complicated tasks require more time and effort for coordination and monitoring, which becomes much more difficult at longer distances (Gumpert, 2018); and that merges and acquisition are less frequent at longer geographic distances for industries where monitoring from afar is important (Blonigen et al., 2019). The findings of this paper contribute to this literature, by showing that a higher overlap in working hours between a headquarters and its distant affiliates significantly eases the costs global firms face when operating across long distances, thus determining location decisions of MNCs activities.====The rest of the paper is divided as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and the construction of relevant variables. Section 3 presents descriptive evidence documenting, among other results, the distance and knowledge intensity trade-off that arises from plausibly existing costs knowledge transmission within MNCs, and how this trade-off is weakened by a higher overlap in working hours between affiliates and their headquarters. Section 4 present the main results of the paper where I implement a regression discontinuity design to estimate whether knowledge intensity significantly differs for subsidiaries across different time zones.

These monetary policies have spilled over abroad (Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012; Ongena et al., 2015; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015; Forbes and Warnock, 2012), and cross-border bank lending is a major channel of such transmission (Rey, 2016; Bruno and Shin, 2015a, Bruno and Shin, 2015b; Alper et al., 2019). In this international context, several papers have studied the transmission of monetary policies into globally active banks' lending to foreign borrowers in their “own” currency (e.g. Temesvary et al. (2018) study the transmission of US monetary policy into U.S. banks' lending abroad; also see Buch et al., 2019).====However, today globally active banks concentrate their cross-border lending in a few reserve currencies. Just three denominations, the US dollar (USD), the euro (EUR) and the Japanese yen (JPY), have shares of around 45%, 34% and 5%, respectively, in cross-border bank lending in 2018.==== In this context, it is important to understand, how monetary policies associated with these reserve currencies transmit into cross-border lending even among those country pairs where neither the lender nor the borrower uses that currency as its own (Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015). However, such currency dimension of the international bank lending channel has received little attention in the literature – primarily due to severe constraints in data availability.====Afforded by recently enhanced data collection, we are able to fill this gap in the literature by using a unique and rarely accessed dataset on the bilateral cross-border lending flows of 27 BIS-reporting banking systems to borrowers in 51 countries. This rich dataset is broken down by currency (USD, EUR and JPY) and target sector of borrowers (banks and non-banks).====We focus on three research questions: First, is there a currency dimension to the international bank lending channel? We find strong evidence that changes in monetary policy in the United States, the euro area and Japan affect cross-border bank lending denominated in USD, EUR and JPY, respectively, even then neither the lending banking system nor the borrower country uses that currency as its own. As an example, changes in US monetary policy affect cross-border USD lending originating from a UK bank to a borrower in Malaysia. Second, which target sectors' borrowing is most affected by this currency dimension of the international bank lending channel: banks or non-banks? We show that this channel operates primarily through lending to non-banks. Third, is the strength of this currency dimension of the bank lending channel different across the three major reserve currencies? We find that this channel is indistinguishable across the USD, EUR and JPY.====Our work is based on an extension of the bank lending channel of monetary policy (Bernanke and Blinder, 1988; Mishkin, 1995). According to the domestic bank lending channel, financial frictions associated with the balance sheet strength of banks amplify the impact of monetary policy changes. For instance, monetary policy tightening reduces the availability of liquidity to banks, which in turn lowers their loan supply. Due to informational frictions in accessing liquidity from funding markets, after a monetary policy tightening-induced liquidity shortage, banks with more balance sheet constraints are less able to buffer the liquidity effects on their lending flows: the effect is stronger for illiquid (Stein, 1998; Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012); small (Kashyap and Stein, 1995; Jimenez et al., 2012; Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012; Gambacorta, 2005; Kakes and Sturm, 2002) and worse-capitalized banks (Peek and Rosengren, 1995; Kishan and Opiela, 2000; Van den Heuvel, 2002; Gambacorta, 2005). This bank lending channel can work internationally: the excess funding liquidity that banks gain from monetary policy easing at home can spill over to higher cross-border loan supply abroad, through the balance sheet of internationally active banks. For instance, US monetary easing could drive up US banks' USD cross-border lending (Temesvary et al., 2018).====Our contribution, the currency dimension of the international bank lending channel, builds on the observation that large internationally active banks borrow and lend in various currencies, including in USD, EUR and JPY. Higher liquidity in a currency that results from monetary policy easing by the issuer central bank raises funding available in that currency to globally active banks. This higher funding liquidity then translates into increased cross-border loan supply in that currency. Our identifying assumption for the currency dimension of the international bank lending channel follows the logic underpinning the studies of the domestic bank lending channel: the monetary policy easing-induced increase in loan supply is particularly expressed for banks whose balance sheets are less liquid, or worse-capitalized banks that must pay more to borrow in funding markets. To isolate monetary policy effects on banks' supply of credit, we control for unobservable credit demand effects by saturating the model with borrowers' country*time fixed effects (Jimenez et al., 2014).====We use a unique and rarely accessed dataset on the bilateral cross-border lending flows of 27 BIS-reporting banking systems to borrowers in 51 countries, broken down by currency (USD, EUR and JPY) and target sector of borrowers (banks and non-banks). This dataset is the first to offer information simultaneously on the three key dimensions which are necessary to answer our research questions on the currency dimension of the international bank lending channel: (1) the currency composition of claims, (2) the location, or residence, of borrowers, and (3) the nationality of lending banking systems (Avdjiev and Takáts, 2019). This dataset is available from Q2 2012 to Q4 2018. Because the monetary policies associated with our three reserve currencies were mostly unconventional over this period, we measure monetary policy changes using the Krippner (2016) short-term shadow interest rates.====We develop three hypotheses. 1) The international bank lending channel has a currency dimension: monetary policy of the currency issuer affects cross-border bank lending in that currency even if the currency issuer's country is not linked to the cross-border activity as either the borrower or the lender'. Furthermore, this currency dimension 2) operates primarily via lending to non-banks; and 3) is similar across reserve currencies (USD, EUR, JPY).====We obtain three main results. First, we find that changes in monetary policy in a currency significantly affect cross-border lending flows in that currency, across all lending banking systems and target countries of borrowers. For instance, US monetary policy easing, as measured by a lower short-term shadow US interest rate, increases cross-border bank lending in USD. The effect holds even when the United States is neither the lending banking system nor the country of borrowers: for instance, US monetary policy changes significantly affect USD lending from the UK banking system to borrowers in Malaysia.====Second, we find that the currency dimension of the bank lending channel works primarily through cross-border lending to non-bank borrowers, while the transmission is not significant to bank borrowers.==== This finding lends our results additional policy relevance, as credit to the non-financial sector is particularly important for real economic growth (Kashyap and Stein, 2000; Peek and Rosengren, 2000). We discuss several features that may underlie our result on the weaker transmission into interbank lending, including compositional differences reflecting interbank lending's greater share of unsecured loans and repos (Avdjiev et al., 2017) and banks' active use of FX derivatives markets (Aldasoro and Ehlers, 2018). We also bridge our result with the existing literature, including discussions of our focus on transmission over a one-year horizon Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015) as well as our use of extensive fixed effects (which fully control for the credit demand-side changes induced by monetary policy that may have contributed to Ehrmann and Worms (2001) or Avdjiev et al. (2017)’s interbank lending results).====Third, we find that the currency dimension of the bank lending channel works similarly across currencies. There are no detectable differences in the lending responses of banking systems to USD, EUR and JPY-associated monetary policy changes, suggesting that the USD network (while special in terms of its size and reach) is not unique in the bank lending channel.====Our results on the international transmission of monetary policy changes are policy-relevant. They suggest that policy-makers should consider not only the source of cross-border lending but also its currency denomination when analysing the impact of cross-border monetary policy and liquidity spillovers. For instance, cross-border lending in EUR and USD may behave differently as US and euro-area monetary policy paths began to diverge (Avdjiev et al., 2017, as the Federal Reserve has led the way, ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan, in removing policy accommodations), even if these loans are targeted at the same borrowers in the same target country and originate from the same lending banking system.====In what follows, in the second section we discuss the related literature and our hypotheses. In the third and fourth section, we present our data and the estimation methodology, respectively. In the fifth and sixth section, we presents the results and robustness checks, respectively. The seventh section concludes with policy implications.",The currency dimension of the bank lending channel in international monetary transmission,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618301818,15 February 2020,2020,Research Article,187.0

It is praised not just for its success in bringing down inflation, but also increasing the credibility and accountability of policymakers (Bernanke and Mishkin, 1997; Ball, 2010). Its popularity is reflected in an increasing number of countries adopting inflation targeting (IT). However, the global financial crisis dramatically changed the perception of IT as an optimal framework for achieving macroeconomic stability, especially when the economy is confronting large real or financial shocks. It is argued that IT, by focusing narrowly on inflation, may contribute to a build-up of financial instability (Taylor, 2007; Frankel, 2012), leading central banks to neglect other objectives, such as employment (Stiglitz, 2008), and constraining those monetary authorities dealing with deep recessions (Borio, 2014). As a result, scholars and policymakers call for refining the IT framework to allow for more flexibility (Svensson, 2009).====While many studies analyze whether inflation targeting affects economic performance, no clear-cut consensus has emerged. The focus of most papers in the literature is on the performance of IT during the relatively good times of the 1990s through the beginning of the 2008 global financial crisis. During those two decades of the “great moderation”, with declining and low inflation rates amid strong economic growth, few countries operating under IT experienced a deep economic or financial crisis. A different, and arguably at least equally important, question is whether IT helps countries and their central banks in dealing with crises, that is, whether it allows stabilizing inflation and output in response to large adverse shocks.====This paper focuses on this question and analyzes whether countries operating under IT have a better macroeconomic performance in response to large adverse shocks than those with non-IT regimes. Thereby, we empirically respond to the question whether IT is a perpetrator, bystander, or savior in the wake of a crisis (Reichlin and Baldwin, 2013). We limit the analysis to the effects of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or windstorms, as these are the most exogenous large adverse shocks that can be identified and as they are shown to have a large impact on the macro-economy (Noy, 2009; Felbermayr and Gröschl, 2014). Natural disasters have a direct negative effect through the destruction of physical capital and durable consumption goods. The analysis can be extended to include other types of shocks, such as financial shocks, though this would entail the risk of endogeneity to the monetary regime. At the same time, natural disaster shocks share similar patterns to capital depreciation rate shocks. The latter type of shocks are used to analyze financial crises (Liu et al., 2011).====Natural disasters can be considered exogenous to the choice of the monetary regime because they are largely unpredictable and not caused by economic conditions. These features allow us to identify the conditional effects of IT using relatively weak and verifiable assumptions about the distribution of the unobserved factors that determine macroeconomic outcomes and about the systematic relation between natural disasters and monetary regimes. In terms of the treatment literature, we assume that, conditioned on country characteristics, the “treatment” in form of a natural disaster is random, but instead of focusing on the effects of the treatment, we study whether alternative monetary regimes imply different responses to the treatment. To obtain a measure of such shocks, we derive a shock variable from the estimated damage to property, crops and livestock contained in the EM-DAT dataset, which documents natural disasters globally. We match them with quarterly macroeconomic data for 76 countries over the period 1980Q1-2015Q4. We then estimate a set of dynamic panel models to trace out the responses of key variables.====We find that disaster shocks are contractionary and inflationary on impact, followed by a short-lived boom in consumption and investment activity. The empirical patterns resemble adverse supply shocks in a New Keynesian model due to the destruction of physical capital and a decline in productivity (Keen and Pakko, 2011). The interpretation as an adverse supply shock is in line with microeconomic evidence hinting toward economic disruptions that also cause indirect losses. Inoue and Todo (2017) show that the Great East Japan earthquake of 2011 was propagated via supply chain disruptions to other regions. The substitution of production inputs poses a drag on firm productivity. The subsequent investment boom we find in the data can be understood through the lens of the Solow (1956) model as catch-up growth.====We document important differences in the dynamic responses of countries under IT (====) and under alternative monetary regimes (====) to the shocks. Targeters perform significantly better regarding both the level and the volatility of output and prices. While GDP drops immediately under both regimes, the initial decline is smaller under IT and the subsequent recovery is stronger and faster. Moreover, consumer prices increase significantly less for targeters. These dynamics are reflected in significant differences across monetary regimes in average GDP growth and inflation following large shocks. The mean quarterly growth rate is higher under IT, and average inflation is lower in the 4 years following a large shock. Moreover, the standard deviations of inflation and components of domestic absorption following a natural disaster are significantly lower under IT than under alternative monetary regimes, thus lowering aggregate volatility.====The main aim of this paper is to provide these stylized facts and we are agnostic about the precise channels leading to the main results. Nevertheless, we also provide evidence on the potential mechanisms through which IT affects the adjustment processes. The results suggest that the shock propagation is positively affected in IT countries by more stable inflation expectations and lower risk premia, potentially due to lower volatility. Further, targeters rely on a different monetary-fiscal policy mix. While we find no direct evidence that better anchored inflation expectations allow for more monetary accommodation conditional on a large shock, fiscal policy seems better capable of stabilizing output.====In contrast, non-targeting monetary authorities tend to ease monetary policy more aggressively and persistently in an effort to stabilize output, while fiscal policy is contractionary. The adverse effects of private credit risk and term premia reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy for non-inflation targeters such that overall this policy mix induces lower output growth, higher inflation, and more volatility. The existence of cross-effects between IT and fiscal policy is documented by Combes et al. (2017). Our findings depict that they also shape the policy mix in response to large disaster shocks. Importantly, we extensively control for institutional quality, which is often held responsible for pro-cyclical fiscal policy in middle-income countries (Frankel et al., 2013), as well as for fiscal rules and alternative financing capacities of countries.====Finally, we find that only hard targeters perform better. Countries that have introduced inflation targeting, but deviate from their target for a prolonged period of time, do not reap the rewards. This difference between hard and soft targeting is important as it suggests that it is not the fact that a central bank formally adopts IT that allows a superior performance. Instead, our findings suggest that it is the track record and the ensuing credibility of an IT central bank that allows it, as well as the fiscal authority, to respond differently and more successfully to the economic shock induced by a natural disaster.====Our paper relates to the large literature on the impact of IT on macroeconomic outcomes. Most of the literature focuses on the unconditional effects of inflation targeting. In a seminal contribution, Ball and Sheridan (2004) find no significant differences in inflation and growth between IT and non-IT countries in a sample of OECD member states and based on a difference-in-difference approach. Similarly, Lin and Ye (2007) detect no effect of IT on either inflation or inflation variability in industrial countries when employing propensity score matching. Using OLS to study the impact of IT on disinflation periods in OECD countries, Brito (2010) concludes that inflation targeters are not able to bring inflation down at less output costs than non-targeters. On the other hand, Gonçalves and Carvalho (2009) find, in a sample of OECD countries, that inflation targeters suffer significantly smaller output losses for reducing inflation when using Probit or Heckman regressions. Moreover, Lin and Ye (2009) and Lin (2010) show evidence that, based on propensity score matching, IT lowers inflation and inflation variability in developing countries. Regarding different country samples, De Mendonça and Souza (2012) find, based on propensity score matching, that IT may be particularly beneficial in developing countries, suggesting that IT might work if it helps improve the credibility of monetary authorities. Overall, this literature seems to conclude that IT matters, especially for developing economies, but is less relevant for advanced economies. Our results differ from this literature by focusing on the conditional effects in the aftermath of large shocks. Further, we show in a robustness section that the baseline results hold for both country groups.====There is also no consensus in the literature that studies the performance of IT during the global financial crisis. While Rose (2014) finds that IT did not substantially change how a country weathered the crisis, Carvalho Filho (2010) and Andersen et al. (2015) present evidence that IT countries fared significantly better during this episode. Our findings support the latter view, since IT helps to buffer large disaster shocks better than alternative monetary regimes. We separate from the existing work as our results are obtained conditional on large exogenous shocks, thereby addressing the endogeneity problem related to the episode of the global financial crisis.====To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to analyze whether inflation targeting is effective as a shock absorber in response to large real shocks. Our econometric approach, which is not previously used to study the macroeconomic impact of IT, has several advantages. First and foremost, estimating the conditional effect of IT, given an exogenous event, bypasses the need to directly deal with the potentially endogenous choice of the monetary regime to macroeconomic conditions as it “nets out” the unconditional impact of IT on the response variables. The methodological approach is inspired by Ramcharan (2007), who uses disasters to evaluate the effects of exchange rate regimes on the adjustment to real shocks in developing countries.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 formulates the theoretical link between inflation targeting and large natural disaster shocks. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy, and introduces the data. Section 4 contains the core results. Section 5 depicts the economic mechanisms leading to the core results. Section 6 provides extensive sensitivity analysis, before the final section concludes.",Inflation targeting as a shock absorber,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300271,5 February 2020,2020,Research Article,188.0

Do free-trade agreements make multilateral cooperation less sustainable? Will countries be more likely to deviate from negotiated tariffs when more trade liberalization realizes in the future? These questions have been studied in theory literature using models that feature repeated games, but have yet to be quantitatively analyzed. In this paper, I propose a methodology to quantitatively characterize the equilibrium strategies on tariffs of various nations in a widely used repeated-game framework. I then apply this methodology to address these questions from a quantitative perspective. The numerical results computed from a reasonably comprehensive ==== trade model corroborate previous analysis derived theoretically from simpler trade models. However, only free-trade agreements appear to influence the sustainability of trade-policy cooperation with quantitative significance.","The global trading system is one of the most prominent examples of successful international policy cooperation, as countries maintain liberalized trade despite the opportunity each has to gain by raising their import tariffs. To explain why low tariffs can be sustained, interactions in international trade policy are typically modeled as a repeated game. Because a country can improve welfare by imposing tariffs that are higher than negotiated levels, deviation can only be deterred when future loss as a result of deviation is larger than the gain. This framework has also been used to study how the existence of multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), preferential trade agreements, or changes in trade volume can affect the sustainability of low tariffs.====Although existing theoretical analysis on trade policy has widely used repeated-game models, related quantitative works using the same framework is rare. If the observed low tariffs are considered an equilibrium outcome of the repeated game, each country's optimized gain from imposing higher tariffs is outweighed by subsequent welfare loss due to other countries' retaliation in the future. Without characterizing the equilibrium quantitatively, however, determining whether such low tariffs can still be sustained under external changes can be difficult. For example, when two countries sign a free-trade agreement (FTA), gains and future loss as a result of deviation will be different not only for the participating countries but for other countries as well. To investigate whether trade-policy cooperation is still sustainable requires quantifying how these welfare consequences change in the new equilibrium of the repeated game.====In this paper, I propose a methodology to quantitatively characterize countries' equilibrium strategies on tariffs. This methodology is compatible with numerous theoretical works that rely on repeated games to explain observed low tariffs, and can be used to study how changes in the world trading system can influence trade-policy cooperation. I first introduce the features these repeated-game models share. In particular, by describing each stage game with a static trade model, I can compute each country's one-period gain from deviation and the future loss as a result of the deviation. Given these computed welfare changes, I can then compute the minimum patience (i.e., discount factor) needed such that an infinite reversion to the punishment phase can sustain the cooperative tariffs. When the deviating country does not incur any loss in punishment phase (the case of winning a trade war first discussed in Johnson (1954), for example), this number will be larger than one, implying that low tariffs are not sustainable. When the minimum patience is less than one, we can still infer which country is more likely to deviate by comparing this measure across countries. For this reason, throughout the paper I will refer to this computed minimum discount factor as a measure of the propensity to deviate.====I then use a multi-country, multi-industry quantitative trade model to illustrate how this methodology can be applied. In this reasonably comprehensive general equilibrium model, governments can use tariffs to improve welfare, measured by either real expenditure or sectoral profits weighted by political incentives as in Grossman and Helpman (1994). Focusing on the major players in international trade policy negotiation, I first numerically compute each country's static welfare change in the deviation phase: each country imposes tariffs that maximize its objective function given other countries' tariffs remaining unchanged. Not surprisingly, all countries can improve their own welfare at the expense of other countries when deviating from low tariffs. In the benchmark case where welfare is measured by real expenditure, the potential one-period welfare gain ranges from 1.1% (Mercosur) to 4.5% (Canada).====I then compute static welfare changes in four counterfactual scenarios relevant to the equilibrium strategies in the punishment phase. Among them, the case of imposing Nash tariffs has been most commonly used in the theoretical analysis of trade policy cooperation, although the case of autarky has also been considered.==== I find that when these two forms of punishments are used, the future loss of any deviating country outweighs the gain from deviation and the calculated minimum discount factor to sustain cooperative tariffs is very small. In other words, the negotiated low tariffs are sustainable when reverting to trade war or autarky infinitely are used to deter deviation. In addition, I also consider two other forms of punishment that are less stringent. In the case of the weakest punishment in which other countries suspend their tariff concessions and impose WTO bound tariffs against the deviating country, the stage equilibrium with low tariffs is not sustainable: the calculated minimum discount factor is greater than one for all countries.====Next, I present how this methodology can be applied to study theoretical findings in trade-policy literature that have yet to be quantitatively analyzed. I first examine whether multilateral institutions such as the WTO reduce the incentives of countries to deviate. Here I focus on the WTO's role of verifying deviation and facilitating multilateral enforcement efforts.==== In other words, in a world without multilateral institutions, countries can impose deviating tariffs against one other and only be punished by the victim country directly injured by the deviation. Maggi (1999) uses a repeated-game framework that incorporates a three-country, partial-equilibrium trade model to show countries can, in theory, sustain a higher equilibrium payoff with multilateral enforcement than with bilateral enforcement. This is mostly because the WTO can introduce punitive tariffs from third parties, which increases potential loss from deviation. I compare the impact of the two enforcement mechanisms on the sustainability of tariffs using the more comprehensive general equilibrium trade model, but still under the same repeated-game framework. The quantitative results support Maggi's claim qualitatively: contrary to the case under the multilateral enforcement mechanism, the factual tariffs become unsustainable under the bilateral enforcement mechanism as countries now gain by imposing deviating tariffs against their weakest trading partners. However, the welfare consequences of removing the WTO is in general not quantitatively significant.====I then turn to analyze whether preferential trade agreements promote or jeopardize the sustainability of multilateral trade cooperation. This question has attracted greater attention since the famous “building block” versus “stumbling block” argument raised by Bhagwati (1991). Although related theoretical research has been fruitful, quantitative work is rare and mostly focuses on how reductions in external most-favored-nation tariffs vary with exposure to preferential trade arrangements.==== I first quantitatively identify the tariff complementarity effect and the punishment effect of enforceable bilateral FTAs. The tariff complementarity effect describes the situation in which an FTA will cause its member countries to impose lower external tariffs in the case of deviation. The punishment effect, on the other hand, is like the mirror image of the tariff complementarity effect: the FTA member countries will impose lower punitive tariffs against deviating non-member countries. According to Bagwell and Staiger (1999b), these two effects are the main channels through which FTAs can affect the sustainability of multilateral trade cooperation in the standard repeated game framework. The numerical results show these two effects on average reduce median optimal tariffs in the deviation phase and punishment phase by 12.7% and 11.6%, respectively. I then compare how the propensity of countries to deviate changes when FTAs are negotiated. I find that a new FTA always makes non-member countries more likely to deviate from negotiated tariffs, whereas the propensity to deviate could either increase or decrease for member countries.====Finally, I analyze the impact of global trade liberalization and hence greater total trade volume on sustainability of trade-policy negotiation. I model trade liberalization as an exogenous, symmetric reduction in tariffs for all ten countries included to study how the propensity of countries to deviate varies along this process. Treating the reduced tariffs as negotiated tariffs to which countries agree to adhere, I can then apply the methodology developed previously to trace how countries' propensity to deviate varies along with worldwide trade liberalization. My results indicate that, with the exception of Japan, the propensities to deviate for all other countries are relatively stable.====Previous quantitative analysis of trade-policy negotiation that incorporates repeated games is rare, despite the framework's popularity in theoretical studies. My work is closely related to Ossa (2014), which provides a first numerical analysis of non-cooperative and cooperative trade policy. Relying on the same procedure to compute welfare changes in the deviation phase and punishment phase, I extend his work by adding inter-temporal interactions into the static trade model. Incorporating the repeated-game framework allows me to quantitatively investigate various theoretical findings from existing literature. For example, I believe this paper is the first attempt to quantify the tariff complementarity effect and the punishment effect of FTAs discussed in Bagwell and Staiger (1999b).==== Likewise, no precedent exists for quantitatively identifying the extent to which multilateral institutions can improve the sustainability of trade negotiation as theorized in Maggi (1999).====Whereas theory literature mostly considers Nash tariffs as punishment once deviation is observed, I also consider autarky and two other means of punishment in the quantitative exercise. The first scenario is sanction: countries in each period of the punishment phase impose optimal tariffs against the deviating country while keeping cooperative tariffs among each other. In addition, I also consider the possibility that the punishment phase is still disciplined by WTO rules and bound tariffs are imposed against the deviating country. This punishment strategy is much weaker than the other three and all countries will choose to deviate from cooperative tariffs in the benchmark case. In other words, when a country wants to abandon WTO rules and deviate from low tariffs, punishments that are constrained by WTO are no longer effective deterrents. By introducing two more plausible means of punishment, this paper also relates to existing research on deterrents to deviating from cooperative tariffs and the role of WTO's dispute settlement.====Although the static trade model I use in this paper builds on the one first discussed in Krugman (1980), the methodology introduced is flexible enough to incorporate alternative trade models. For example, I do not foresee any obstacle using other quantitative trade models such as those in Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Melitz (2003) to quantify equilibrium strategies. Ossa (2015) shows that gains from trade among these gravity models will differ once the industry dimension of trade flows is taken into account. Hence, choosing other static models that feature multiple sectors will lead to different characterizations. In addition, the procedure discussed in this paper should not have any problem incorporating other plausible means of punishment.====The data used in this paper build upon those analyzed in Ossa (2016). Throughout this paper, I focus on the world's nine largest economies==== and a residual Rest of the World. Each economy is further disaggregated into 33 industries. Trade, production, and applied tariff data come from the Global Trade Analysis Project database (GTAP 8) for the year 2007. Following the “exact hat algebra” popularized by Dekle et al. (2007), I express equilibrium conditions in changes to reduce the number of parameters that need to be calibrated. In addition, calculating tariffs imposed by welfare-maximizing governments in various counterfactual scenarios involves high dimensional numerical optimization. Hence, to improve efficiency, I use the method of mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), which is first introduced by Su and Judd (2012). Whereas Ossa (2014) first uses this method to compute cooperative and non-cooperative tariffs, Mei (2019) also uses MPEC to quantify the welfare effects of product regulations and their international harmonization.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section develops a methodology to quantitatively characterize countries' equilibrium strategies in a repeated-game framework, and provides some intuitions on why the minimum patience needed to sustain cooperative tariffs can be considered a measure of the incentive to deviate. Section III applies the methodology with a standard multi-sector trade model and presents some numerical results. In the subsequent three sections, I then study some theoretical findings in the existing literature from a quantitative perspective. Specifically, Section IV is devoted to analyzing the impact of multilateral institutions on the sustainability of trade-policy cooperation. Section V focuses on the impact of FTAs, and Section VI discusses how countries' propensity to deviate varies with exogenous worldwide trade liberalization.

The automatic extension of EU AD policy to new member states following their accession is exogenous to new members' trade shocks. Using this source of variation, the paper shows that, on average, AD duties raise producer prices of targeted exporters. However, import prices from countries with non-market economy status (NMES) - notably China - remain unchanged, while quantities fall more strongly. This is in line with expectations, as the EU applies special rules to NMES countries. The trade dampening effects of AD duties persist over time. Moreover, the duties appear to induce exporters from non-targeted countries to increase their prices.","Antidumping (AD) duties are by far the most frequently used trade defence instruments: in 2017, 1600 such measures were in force worldwide.==== However, estimating their effects on trade flows and prices is difficult. AD duties typically are imposed as a response to an increase in imports. Hence, endogeneity is inherent in these trade policy instruments. To tackle this problem, this paper exploits the EU enlargement of 2004 as a natural experiment.====At the time of their accession to the EU, the new member states were required to adopt the existing EU AD policy. Under the assumption that the decision to join the EU was independent of existing AD duties, the enlargement constitutes an exogenous treatment of new member states. Therefore, one can use a simple difference-in-differences regression to estimate the effect of AD duties on producer (i.e. pre-duty) import prices and quantities. The approach exploits the change over time in import prices and quantities of treated exporting country-product combinations relative to non-treated ones.====In addition, the natural experiment can shed light on the impacts of a recent policy change. In December 2017, the EU has adjusted its AD regulation, officially abandoning the concept of Non-Market Economy Status (NMES).==== This may have important implications because Market Economy Status (MES, assigned to the exporter by the imposing country) determines the way AD duties are calculated. In a nutshell, exporters in countries with MES receive individual firm specific duties, whereas NMES exporters are subject to a - typically larger - country-wide duty that is the same for all exporting firms. For this reason, the effects of EU AD duties on import prices and quantities should differ between exporting countries with MES and those with NMES. This paper provides a test for this prediction.====The paper shows that AD duties raise pre-duty import prices on average by 25%. However, prices only increase for imports originating from countries with MES. Producer prices of imports from non-market economies remain unchanged. Import quantities on average fall by 74%. This effect is stronger for NMES exporters (on average 85% compared to 68% for MES exporters) which is due to the higher average duties they face. Price as well as quantity effects of AD duties persist over time, even after their revocation. Finally, producer prices of imports from countries not targeted by AD duties also increase. AD duties may thus have signalling effects, causing non-targeted exporters to update their beliefs of becoming subject to AD investigations and raise prices in anticipation.====This paper relates to three strands of literature, namely the impact of AD duties on import prices, on quantities as well as on third countries. Regarding import prices, AD duties work through two channels. Like tariffs, they directly increase consumer prices (assuming positive pass-through). In addition, and in contrast to ordinary tariffs, they should incentivise exporters to raise their prices. Having the official objective to protect the importer's domestic market from “unfair” foreign competition (European Parliament, 2017; European Commission, 2016), AD duties can be adjusted if the exporter increases ex-factory prices (Feenstra, 2008).====Consequently, theory predicts pass-through rates larger than 100% as exporters increase prices to achieve a reduction of AD duties in subsequent periods (Blonigen and Haynes, 1999; Blonigen and Park, 2004). Over time, this results in a worsening of the importer's terms of trade. Hence, in addition to determining the effectiveness of this policy instrument, measuring price responses of exporters constitutes an important component when evaluating the effects of AD duties on welfare.====Empirical investigations of price effects of AD duties remain scarce. Blonigen and Haynes (2002) examine the impact of US AD duties on imports of iron and steel from Canada. They find that AD duties indeed lead to higher pre-duty import prices from the point of view of the AD imposer. Lu et al. (2013) use Chinese customs data to investigate the effect of US AD duties on Chinese exports to the US. The authors do not find positive price effects.====Indirect evidence for price effects is provided by Gourlay and Reynolds (2012), who show that US duties against China (and other countries) fall following the first review. This indicates an increase in producer prices. Nita and Zanardi (2013) find that EU duties against China increase slightly after the first interim review (they fall for other countries), indicating further dumping. Whether the price effects of AD duties depend on the MES of the exporter has so far been completely ignored by existing studies.====This paper adds to the literature by investigating the universe of EU imports. This enables a comparison of the effects of AD duties across different exporting countries. The findings indicate that the seemingly conflicting results of Blonigen and Haynes (2002) (increasing producer prices following AD duties against Canada) and Lu et al. (2013) (no producer price effects for exports from China) are driven by the MES of the exporters considered in the respective studies. While the effect of AD duties on average export prices is positive, these price increases are driven by exporters from MES countries such as Canada. Import prices from NMES countries (including China) remain unchanged. Hence, this paper is the first to identify differential trade effects of AD duties by MES of the exporter.====The second strand of literature to which this paper contributes concerns the effects of AD duties on import values and quantities.==== Prusa, 1997, Prusa, 2001 investigates the implementation of US AD duties, showing that they reduce US imports from targeted countries by up to 50%. In contrast to that, Egger and Nelson (2011) find much smaller effects.==== For the European Union, Messerlin (1989), Lasagni (2000) and Konings et al. (2001) estimate treatment effects similar in magnitude to those of Prusa, 1997, Prusa, 2001.==== Vandenbussche and Zanardi (2010) look at several AD imposing countries, finding that AD duties imposed by the so called “new adopters” have trade chilling effects on bilateral trade flows. Following the availability of firm-level export data, a growing literature is also starting to look at impacts of AD duties on exporting firms.====The above studies potentially suffer from endogeneity bias due to simultaneity of AD duties and imports. AD duties typically increase consumer prices and thus reduce import quantities of targeted products. However, being designed to protect domestic industry, they are more likely to be imposed on products with low prices and high import quantities. This simultaneity of imports and AD duties results in biased estimates of the treatment effect (Bown and Crowley, 2013). For quantity effects, the bias is likely to be positive, leading to an underestimation of the (negative) treatment effect.==== For prices - assuming that AD duties do indeed raise prices - the bias is likely to be negative, as AD duties are more likely to be implemented on products for which dumping is suspected, i.e. import prices are low.====Measuring these effects correctly is, however, essential for inferring the consequences on welfare resulting from trade destruction and increased prices of intermediates. It is also required for the effective design of AD policies. This paper adds to the above strand of literature by exploiting the EU enlargement of 2004 as a natural experiment to tackle simultaneity (as well as omitted variable bias) and obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of AD on imports. Estimated effects are larger than those found by previous studies, indicating that these may indeed suffer from simultaneity bias, which results in an underestimation of the treatment effect.====Third, the paper relates to the literature on the effects of trade policies on untargeted countries. Bown and Crowley (2007) and Baylis and Perloff (2010) find evidence for trade deflection (increased exports to third countries) following the imposition of US AD duties against Japanese and Mexican exports respectively. Similarly, Nguyen et al. (2017) show that EU duties imposed on Vietnamese footwear increase Vietnamese exports to the US. Chandra (2016) finds evidence for trade deflection following the imposition of US temporary trade barriers against China. Other studies do not find systematic evidence for trade deflection following the imposition of US AD duties (Lu et al., 2013) or EU and US import restrictions (Bown and Crowley, 2010) against China. Prusa (1997) shows that US AD duties divert imports from targeted to non-targeted countries.====This paper finds that producer prices of imports from non-targeted countries increase following the imposition of AD duties against another country. This result can be explained by the uncertainty surrounding the AD process. Dumping allegations for the same product are often investigated separately for different exporting countries. Given the uncertainty surrounding the AD investigation process (Blonigen and Park, 2004), the imposition of AD duties against one exporting country may induce producers of the same product in other exporting countries to update their beliefs regarding the likelihood of being investigated and becoming subject to duties. They thus raise prices in order to avoid future duties. In line with findings by Prusa (1997), the price increase is smaller than the one observed for targeted countries.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the EU AD methodology and its implications for exporter behaviour. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy. This is followed by an overview of the data used, including some descriptive evidence in Section 4. Section 5 presents the core results of the paper. Section 6 offers several extensions and robustness checks and Section 7 concludes.",The trade effects of antidumping duties: Evidence from the 2004 EU enlargement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219962030026X,1 February 2020,2020,Research Article,190.0

We add a role for income-dependent demand interacted with factor intensities in production. We explore how income growth and trade liberalization influence the demand for skilled labor when preferences are non-homothetic and when income-elastic goods are more intensive in skilled labor, an empirical regularity documented in Caron et al. (2014). To do so, we simulate the growth in both income and exports observed between 1995 and 2010 by adjusting sector-neutral productivity and trade costs. Relative to what we would obtain with homothetic preferences, we show that these changes lead to significant increases in the skill premium, especially in developing countries. Our results are mostly driven by productivity growth shifting consumption towards skill-intensive goods, but non-homothetic preferences also matter when evaluating the effect of trade. Overall, the negative effect of trade cost reductions on the skill premium predicted for developing countries under homothetic preferences (Stolper-Samuelson) is strongly mitigated, and sometimes reversed.","Income inequality, especially between skilled and unskilled workers, has increased considerably over the past three decades. This observation has led to a large body of research aiming to explain these changes, often focusing on the roles of trade and (or versus) skill-biased technological change.==== Other recent work has highlighted the role of several alternative channels in explaining these changes, such as trade and offshoring through Heckscher-Ohlin-type mechanisms,==== heterogeneous technology adoption across firms,==== changes in matching patterns between heterogeneous workers and firms,==== and quality upgrading encouraged by trade liberalization.==== While this significant body of work concentrates on the production side of general equilibrium, there is a smaller literature that considers shifting patterns of demand across sectors that require different types of skills.==== The sources of these demand shifts are in some cases modeled explicitly and in others simply taken as exogenous. Our paper relates to this demand-driven literature, though we link characteristics of goods in consumption to characteristics of goods in production in a very explicit way. We will first describe our approach, and then explain how it contrasts to other literature later in the section.====In this paper, we illustrate how income growth and reductions in trade costs affect the skill premium when preferences are non-homothetic. Our results rely on the correlation between income elasticity in consumption and skill intensity in production across goods, shown to be very large in Caron et al. (2014). This correlation implies that homogeneous productivity growth across sectors is no longer neutral for the skill premium in general equilibrium. As countries grow richer, their consumers increase their relative consumption of goods that are more skill-intensive in production, thereby increasing the returns to skilled labor relative to unskilled labor. The effects of trade cost reductions on the skill premium also differ when preferences are non-homothetic and when income-elastic goods are more skill intensive: the net skilled-labor content of trade and the effect of trade-driven income growth are both different under these conditions.====To quantify these mechanisms, our analysis proceeds in three steps. In step 1, we describe a model of production, trade and consumption in general equilibrium. In step 2, we estimate the preference, trade cost and technology parameters of the model. We take a cross-sectional approach which allows us to identify the role of income in explaining shifts in consumption. In step 3, we simulate various counterfactual equilibria to quantify and illustrate the impact of productivity growth and trade cost reductions on the skill premium. Before proceeding, we wish to emphasize that while we do show that non-homothetic preferences push the model's predictions closer to observed estimates of the skill premium, our methodology does not permit us to empirically evaluate the contributions of growth and trade relative to the alternative theories of the skill premium mentioned above.====The first step of our analysis is to develop a model combining non-homothetic preferences with a standard multi-sector and multi-factor model on the supply side. Consumption patterns are derived from “constant relative income elasticity” (CRIE) preferences as in Caron et al. (2014) and Fieler (2011). The supply-side structure is an extension of Costinot et al. (2012) and Eaton and Kortum (2002) with multiple factors of production and an input-output structure as in Caliendo and Parro (2014). The model can be used to derive first-order approximations of the response of the skill premium to uniform changes in productivity and trade costs, with and without taking into account the demand for intermediate goods. These approximations help develop the intuition behind the mechanisms and emphasize the role played by the correlation between income elasticity and skill intensity.====In a second step, we estimate preference, trade cost and technology parameters. Our estimations rely on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) dataset. In order to test whether our mechanisms have quantitative relevance in explaining changes in the skill premium going back several decades, we estimate our model using version 5 of the dataset (Dimaranan and McDougall 2002), which is based on 1997 data. GTAP 5 comprises 66 countries with a wide range of income levels, 56 broad sectors including manufacturing and services, and 5 factors of production including the disaggregation of skilled and unskilled labor.==== This dataset is uniquely suited to our purposes, as it contains a consistent and reconciled cross-section of production, input-output, consumption and trade data. However, the broad categories of goods and services make it unsuitable for the discussion of issues related to product quality and within-industry heterogeneity.====We follow the same estimation method as Caron et al. (2014). We first estimate gravity equations within each sector, which allows us to identify patterns of comparative advantage and to construct price indices across importers and sectors. We then estimate consumer preferences, adjusting for these price index differences. To account for endogeneity, we also instrument prices with indices that do not depend on domestic demand. This strategy allows us to estimate and identify price and income elasticity parameters for a large range of sectors, which is usually complicated by the lack of consistent price and expenditure data, as well as by endogenous prices. We find that per capita income plays a crucial role in determining demand patterns across countries and sectors. Income-elasticity in consumption varies largely across goods and is highly correlated with skill intensity in production, as also documented in Caron et al. (2014), with an estimated correlation above 40–70% across all goods, whether or not we exclude services.====In a third step, we use our estimates of preferences, trade cost and technology parameters for counterfactual simulations in general equilibrium. Our objective is to quantitatively assess whether historical rates of growth in income and trade liberalization may have affected the skill premium, with a focus on the role of non-homothetic changes in consumption. To do so, we first calibrate growth in productivity and reductions in trade costs to match observed growth in real per capita income and trade/GDP ratios between 1995 and 2010. Counterfactuals then examine how these productivity and trade shocks affect the skill premium, allowing for non-homotheticity in demand. Even if these shocks are uniform across sectors, their effects are not. Our simulation results reveal an increase in the skill premium in almost all countries. The increases are particularly large in the developing world, with an average of 9.3% in low-income countries. With homothetic preferences, the model predicts a 0.6% ==== in the skill premium in these countries. For China, the model predicts a 17% increase in the skill premium; for India, 22%; for Vietnam, 21%. The predicted increase is also substantial in many African countries. Changes are on average smaller in middle- and high-income countries, at 2.4%, but remain significantly larger than with homothetic preferences (0.5%).====We then decompose these results to disentangle the relative contributions of growth and openness to trade. To pinpoint the role of growth in per capita income, we first re-simulate the changes in the skill premium caused by our estimated 1995–2010 productivity shocks (holding trade costs fixed at 1995 levels). Results suggest a large potential for income growth to affect the skill premium. The strong correlation between skill intensity and income elasticity induces a quantitatively large shift in demand towards skill-intensive goods as per capita income increases. This effect is quantitatively important and explains most of the overall changes in the skill premium found in the unified counterfactual where trade costs also change. This is particularly true for developing countries, which are rapidly transitioning out of unskilled-labor intensive sectors such as agriculture and basic manufacturing. The increase in the skill premium explained by productivity growth is 7.9% higher with non-homothetic than with homothetic preferences in low-income countries (9.6% vs. 1.7%). The difference is 10% in China and 19% in India, but only 1.8% on average in middle- and high-income countries. We show that the higher increase in low-income countries is not primarily driven by differences in growth rates across countries, and is robust to a number of assumptions underlying our exercise, including the choice of demand system.====Note that the main mechanism in this ‘growth-only’ counterfactual does not rely on trade linkages and we obtain no sizable difference between closed and open economy simulations, except for a few small open countries. On the other hand, input-output linkages play an important role. Industries upstream of skill-intensive industries tend to be skill intensive themselves, but on average less so, such that there is less variation in skill intensities when intermediate goods are accounted for. Still, the correlation between skill intensity and income elasticity is similar with or without intermediates. Thus, while input-output linkages dampen the link between changes in consumption and changes in the skill premium, they by far do not eliminate it.====We then examine how preferences affect the relationship between trade liberalization and the skill premium by re-simulating the estimated 1995–2010 changes in trade costs (holding productivity fixed at 1995 levels). We highlight and quantify four channels through which non-homothetic preferences affect results. The first channel reflects how non-homothetic preferences affect predicted trade patterns and the strength of Stolper-Samuelson forces. The standard Stolper-Samuelson argument, which holds with homothetic preferences, suggests that in countries abundant in unskilled labor, the direct effect of trade cost reductions is a decrease in the relative demand for skilled workers, while the reverse is true for skill-abundant countries. Our results suggest that the introduction of non-homothetic preferences into the model substantially moderates this prediction. As documented in Caron et al. (2014), non-homothetic preferences lead to less trade between high- and low-income countries, and smaller net factor content of trade in skilled and unskilled labor. This weakens the Stolper-Samuelson effect, especially for developing countries for which the net factor content of trade is significantly lower under non-homotheticity.====A second channel highlights the income effect of trade. As trade costs decline, gains from trade make countries richer. Similar to the effect productivity growth, consumption thus shifts towards income-elastic and skill intensive goods. Simulations show that the trade-induced income effect is quantitatively significant in many developing countries. We also illustrate the role of input-output linkages (magnifying our results) and general-equilibrium feedbacks (mitigating our results), but we find that these last two channels only moderately affect the first two. Combined, these mechanisms suggest that non-homothetic preferences generate a higher skill premium for the same amount of trade liberalization in all but the richest countries. The difference is strong in developing countries, many of which see the negative effect of trade on the skill premium predicted under homotheticity disappear altogether.====Our simulated changes in the skill premium suggest that demand-driven mechanisms may have played a quantitatively important role in driving observed changes in relative wages – comparable in magnitude to other mechanisms discussed in the literature such as skill-biased technological change (Autor et al., 1998). These alternative mechanisms are likely to confound and interact with demand-side forces and are not captured in our model, so we cannot identify the relative importance of non-homothetic preferences. Still, a simple correlation exercise suggests that they might help explain patterns of historical growth in the skill premium across countries, especially for low-income countries where growth in both income and the skill premium has been strongest and where the demand effect is strongest. For 40 countries, we compare our simulated estimates to observed 1995 to 2010 changes in the skill premium described in the WIOD dataset (used, among others, in Cravino and Sotelo, 2019). We find that allowing for non-homothetic preferences significantly increases the correlation between simulated and observed changes in the skill premium. For several countries, the effect is remarkable. In China, for instance, the 17% simulated increase relative to the homothetic case can be contrasted with the 51% increase observed in the WIOD data. In rich countries the effect is smaller, but not negligible: the mechanism generates an increase in the skill premium that represents about 20% of the observed increase in the US over that period (using an estimate from Parro, 2013).====As noted at the onset, the literature on the skill premium is large. Since we are not attempting to run a horse race among competing explanations, our review of the literature is not exhaustive and omits numerous papers focusing on skill-biased technical change and standard Heckscher-Ohlin type trade mechanisms. These models and results are clearly empirically important, but for the sake of exposition we instead focus on work more related to our own, i.e. related to the demand side.====In the international trade literature, Markusen (2013) theoretically identified some of the potential consumption-driven impacts on the skill premium that we quantify. In a stylized model, he postulates that non-homothetic preferences and a possible correlation between income elasticity in consumption and skill intensity in production would cause neutral productivity growth to increase the relative wage of skilled workers. Caron et al. (2014) show that the correlation is empirically strong and illustrate the consequences for trade patterns, trade-to-GDP ratios, and the missing trade puzzle. Here, we examine and quantify the implications of this correlation for the skill premium.====More generally, this paper is part of a renewed interest in non-homothetic preferences in open-economy settings in the trade literature. Fieler (2011), Simonovska (2015), Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) also incorporate non-homotheticities in consumption, adding to a literature initiated by Markusen (1986), Flam and Helpman (1987), Matsuyama (2000) among others. While related to our work in terms of non-homotheticity, these papers concentrate on issues other than the skill premium, such as explaining trade volumes and patterns, and markups in relation to per-capita incomes. Matsuyama (2019) pushes this literature further by endogenizing the relationship between non-homothetic preferences and differential productivity growth rates across sectors and patterns of specialization.====Conversely, work on trade and the skill premium has mostly focused on the supply side. A few papers have confirmed Stolper-Samuelson effects for developing countries (e.g. Robertson, 2004 for Mexico, Gonzaga et al., 2006 for Brazil), which are often at odds with the increasing wage inequality that we observe in most countries (Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2007). Most of the recent literature on trade and the skill premium thus aims to explain why trade may lead to a larger increase (a more positive or less negative change) in the skill premium than suggested by the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model. Bustos (2011) proposes a mechanism whereby access to foreign markets triggers the adoption of skill-biased technologies and provides supportive evidence from Argentinian firm-level data. Burstein and Vogel (2017) also examine how the heterogeneous effect of trade across firms influences the relative demand for skilled labor, and show that this within-sector reallocation channel can be potentially much larger than standard Heckscher-Ohlin channels. Costinot and Vogel (2010) indicate that poor countries facing large demand for skill-intensive goods from rich countries might experience a positive effect of trade on the skill premium, but do not examine this claim empirically. Cravino and Sotelo (2019) show that a reduction in trade costs leads to a relative expansion of the service sector relative to the manufacturing sector when these sectors are strong complements. Since service activities are more intensive in skilled labor, this leads to a larger increase in the skill premium.====Non-homotheticity in consumption also plays an important role in the literature on trade and quality (e.g. Hallak, 2010; Feenstra and Romalis, 2014). If the production of higher-quality goods requires relatively more skilled labor, the idea developed here can be applied to link the skill premium to the demand for quality.==== Opening to trade with richer countries, as well as increasing income per capita, should lead to increasing demand for higher-quality goods and an increase in the skill premium. The link between quality and skilled labor is present in the work of Fieler et al. (2018) who, without explicitly modeling final demand, examine the effect of trade liberalization in Colombia. They argue that opening to trade led to an increase in the demand for skilled workers due to the increase in the quality of goods being produced.====Since our model and approach rely on shifts in the composition of demand across sectors, at least two papers that provide strong evidence for these shifts should be noted. In the literature examining the source and consequences of structural change, Buera and Kaboski (2012) discuss how productivity growth leads to an increase in the skill premium. They develop and calibrate a two-sector model in which growth leads to a higher share of services, which are more skill intensive. They do not, however, estimate or quantify the role of non-homothetic preferences, nor do they discuss the correlation between skill intensity and income elasticity beyond the two-sector approach. Our estimated income elasticities tend to be larger for services sectors, but the correlation between skill intensity and income elasticity holds even when we exclude services. Since it holds for traded goods, the correlation also has implications for the composition of trade and can help us explain why trade can have a positive effect on the skill premium in developing countries relative to standard models.====A second paper is Johnson and Keane (2013), who examine how sectoral shifts in consumption influence the demand for many different types of labor. In particular, they document the importance of demand shifts across occupations, such as the shift towards (heavily female) service occupations.==== However, Johnson and Keane (2013) do not model or explain these sectoral demand shifts, a primary purpose of our paper.====Finally, a growing literature examines the differential effect of trade on the cost of living across workers and households within a country. This channel has been examined, among others, by Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016), Nigai (2016) and He and Zhang (2017).==== For most countries, Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) estimate that poor households gain relatively more from trade through cost-of-living effects, while Nigai (2016) tends to find the opposite. He and Zhang (2017) extend Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) to allow for worker sorting across multiple sectors, and show that the effect of trade on the cost of living can be quantitatively larger than the effects on nominal income. While we acknowledge that cost-of-living effects matter for welfare, we focus here on the channels through which trade (and growth) affects the skill premium in nominal terms.==== Our approach is closer to the Heckscher-Ohlin tradition of multiple factors of production, so we can easily analyze skilled versus unskilled wages and distinguish sectors by factor intensities, which is exactly what we have in our data.====The rest of the paper is organized in three sections. We describe our theoretical framework in Section 2, our empirical strategy and estimation results in Section 3, and the quantitative implications for the skill premium in Section 4.",Per capita income and the demand for skills,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300258,30 January 2020,2020,Research Article,191.0

In the absence of an ultimate adjudicator and enforcer, countries inevitably have unresolved disputes and nearly all expend resources on defense to prepare for the possibility of outright conflict or to improve their bargaining positions under the threat of conflict. Despite the anarchic nature of international relations, the classical liberal perspective views greater trade openness among potential adversaries as reducing or even eliminating conflict (e.g., Polachek, 1980). One argument in support of this view builds on the disruptive nature of conflict that prevents the realization of at least some of the gains from trade; then, countries acting collectively and wanting to reap those gains would have a greater interest under trade to maintain a peaceful order. However, as is well-known with the prisoners' dilemma being a stark and simple example, collective rationality need not and often does not prevail. Indeed, emphasizing self-interest and individual rationality as well as the anarchic nature of international relations, the realist/neorealist perspective argues, in contrast to the classical liberal view, that trade can aggravate conflict between nations (e.g., Waltz, 1979). Specifically, the benefits from freer trade can fuel frictions, as some states perceive that they (or their rivals) will gain a military edge in security competition.====Our central objective in this paper is to study how the expansion of international trade affects the intensity of conflict, measured in terms of resources allocated to it. Consider, for example, the ongoing dispute involving China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei for control over the Spratly and Paracel islands in the South China Sea, where there are oil reserves. Does trade between these rivals pacify their relations inducing them to allocate fewer resources to their respective militaries as might be implied by the classical liberal view, or does it make their rivalry more severe?====Previous theoretical treatments of trade and conflict in the economics literature have identified two distinct channels through which trade between countries could influence their military spending: a factor-price channel and an income channel. For example, based on extensions of Heckscher-Ohlin models that emphasize differences in factor endowments, Skaperdas and Syropoulos (2001) and Garfinkel et al. (2015) study settings with two small countries that contest a resource and can trade in world markets. A shift from autarky to trade in such settings changes product prices and thus relative factor prices, and thereby alters the cost of combining resources to produce military force. Depending on world prices, then, trade can either amplify or diminish the countries' incentives to arm and, as a result, either intensify or pacify their dispute over the resource. Garfinkel et al. (2019) abstract from this channel to highlight the income channel in a dynamic model, where two countries make consumption, investment and arming decisions in the first period, as they face a strictly positive probability in the next period of having to contest a portion of the combined returns from their first-period investments. The authors find that trade in the first period raises the incomes of both countries and their production of arms, with the initially smaller country gaining some power relative to its larger trading partner and potential foe.====The analysis in this paper, based on a variant of the Ricardian model suitably extended to allow for international disputes, studies a third channel through which trade can matter for military spending—namely, a terms-of-trade (TOT) channel. As in the canonical, two-good, two-country Ricardian model, international differences in technology serve as the basis for comparative advantage and provide the rationale for mutually advantageous trade. However, in a departure from that model, we assume the input to the production of potentially traded goods is produced with two primary resources, one of which is partially insecure and thus subject to dispute. The disputed resource could be oil, minerals, timber, land, or water.==== Its division depends on the countries' “arms” or “guns,” also produced domestically using the two primary resources. Since arming is endogenous, so too are the residual resources and the intermediate input used in the production of consumption goods.====A key feature of this setting is the endogeneity of world prices that makes security policies trade-regime dependent.==== To highlight the importance of this mechanism, we construct a simple model that abstracts from the factor-price and income channels mentioned above.==== Furthermore, we abstract from many salient features of today's world economy, such as the presence of increasing returns, foreign investment, and growth. In addition, we do not differentiate between the mobilization of resources for conflict and the potentially destructive deployment of those resources, nor do we consider explicitly the disruptive effect of conflict to shut down trade between warring nations.==== Instead, motivated by the empirical relevance of military expenditures, we focus on arming.==== Insofar as resources are absorbed into the production of arms (thus becoming unavailable for producing goods traded in world markets), these expenditures represent an additional opportunity cost of conflict. Given our focus, this paper can be thought of as an analysis of a modified version of the classical liberal view, one that applies to “cold” wars.====We compare the outcomes under two polar trade regimes, autarky and free trade. As one would expect, given the amount of resources allocated to arming, a shift from autarky to free trade unambiguously results in higher payoffs to both countries. However, because in our setting such a switch also influences arming decisions (or security policies), the welfare consequences of introducing or liberalizing trade can differ significantly from those that typically arise in mainstream analyses, which assume perfect and costless security.====Under autarky, each country chooses its security policy so as to equate the marginal benefit of capturing the contested resource to the marginal cost of diverting resources from its own production and thus consumption. At the same time, each country's arming choice adversely affects the opponent by reducing its access to the contested resource. In equilibrium, both countries ignore this negative security externality and arming is strictly positive.====Importantly, trade induces each country to internalize, at least partially, the negative externality of its security policy on the resources available to its rival. The result is a lower incentive to arm given the rival's policy. To be more precise, as in the case of autarky, when the two countries trade with each other, each one chooses its arming to balance its marginal benefit with its marginal cost. In the case of trade, however, each country's payoff depends on the production of its adversary's exported good. Accordingly, an increase in one's own arms has an additional cost under trade: a reduction in the adversary's share of the contested resource and thus a reduction in the adversary's production of its exports. The added cost, which is reflected in a deterioration of the importing country's TOT that lowers the overall marginal benefit of arming relative to the marginal cost, means that a country's incentive to arm, given the adversary's arming choice, is strictly lower under free trade than under autarky. This finding is robust to the presence of trade costs and does not disappear when countries simultaneously and non-cooperatively choose tariffs.====Of course, the effect of a shift from autarky to trade on ==== arming and thus on welfare depends not only on the direct effect given the rival's arming choice, but also on the indirect or strategic effect as the rival country's arming changes. However, we find that the strategic effect is, by and large, of second-order importance. That is to say, provided the distribution of the contested resource (what we call “capital”) and the uncontested resource (what we call “labor”) across the adversarial countries is not severely uneven, the strategic effect tends to reinforce the direct effect or, even if it moves in the opposite direction, is swamped by the direct effect. In either case, since trade is no worse than autarky for a given level of arming, the reduction in arming and thus security costs render trade unambiguously superior to autarky. This added benefit, not captured by mainstream trade theory that abstracts from the insecurity of property, is consistent with the spirit of classical liberalism and the writings of authors such as Angell (1933) who extolled the virtues of trade openness and globalization.====But, there do exist sufficiently asymmetric distributions of resources where one country has a sharply larger ratio of capital to labor than its adversary to imply a sharply greater opportunity cost of arming; this country arms by less than its rival under both trade regimes, but a shift to trade induces it to increase its arming as its rival reduces its arming.==== Even though the country that is induced to arm by less remains more powerful, the resulting adverse strategic effect it realizes could swamp its gains from trade to render trade unappealing. This finding is reminiscent of the realist/neorealist view in the international relations literature (mentioned above) that highlights trade's effect to generate uneven gains to trading partners and thereby differentially influence their arming and thus the balance of power.==== However, we find that the differential influence of trade on the two countries' arming choices and the implied influence on the balance of power hinge on sharp differences in the mix of their initial holdings of capital and labor, not simply on differences in the size of their economies.==== Nonetheless, even in such cases, we find that a move to trade, whether costly or not, results in lower aggregate arming.====The logic of the TOT channel has sharply different implications for the effect of increased integration of world markets on the incentives to arm by adversarial countries that do not directly trade with each other, but instead with a friendly country. To isolate these differences, we focus on adversaries having a similar comparative advantage.==== Suppose, in particular, that the two adversarial countries are identical in every respect so that, even in the absence of barriers to trade, they would not trade with each other. Also, suppose that there exist technological differences between these countries on the one hand and the third country on the other hand that, given the resources allocated to arming, make trade mutually advantageous. Since the two adversaries compete in the market for the same good exported to a third country in this case, arming generates an added marginal benefit under trade through the TOT channel to increase arming incentives under trade relative to those under autarky. That expanded trade opportunities with another (friendly) country can intensify conflict between two adversaries is similar in essence to Martin et al. (2008), who show that increasing the opportunities for trade among all countries reduces the interdependence between any two and thus can make conflict between them more likely. However, while that analysis emphasizes the importance of the disruptive effects of conflict, ours underscores the importance of the endogeneity of arming and its trade-regime dependence. Furthermore, our analysis, like Skaperdas and Syropoulos (2001) and Garfinkel et al. (2015), suggests that, in this case, trade between friends could make the adversaries worse off.====Based on the different implications of trade with the enemy versus trade with friends for arming choices, we also provide some suggestive evidence in support of the theory. Our empirical analysis studies how trade openness, measured inversely by trade costs, influences national military spending, with data surrounding the end of the Cold War. An essential feature of this analysis lies in the distinction made, using data on bilateral “strategic rivalries” from Thompson (2001), between countries that have no rivals and countries that do have rivals. For countries having rivals, we further differentiate between their trade costs with rivals and their trade costs with friends. This distinction is statistically significant, with qualitative differences as predicted. Specifically, the estimates confirm that a country's military spending is positively related to its trade costs with rivals, but inversely related to its trade costs with friends. These results, which are robust to a series of alternative specifications that address concerns of possible endogeneity of the trade-cost variables in the econometric model, complement the more structural evidence provided by Martin et al. (2008) that increased trade flows need not always promote peace and by Seitz et al. (2015) that reductions in trade costs bring added benefits largely through their effect to dampen defense spending, not only by trading partners, but other countries too.====In what follows, the next section presents the basic model, focusing on just two countries that trade with one another. In Section 3, we characterize the countries' incentives to arm under each trade regime. Section 4 studies how equilibrium arming and payoffs compare across trade regimes and discusses how the central results remain intact with the introduction of trade costs. In Section 5, we extend the framework by introducing a third (non-adversarial) country. In Section 6, we present our empirical evidence. Concluding remarks follow in Section 7.

I quantify the model using both firm-level and aggregate moments for 37 countries. I found that the reduction in MP costs accounts for 56% of the average decline in labor shares from 1996 to 2011, and the model also replicates a negative relationship between the change in a country's labor share and the change in the foreign affiliates' output share as observed in the data.","Multinational firms have played an increasingly prominent role in the global economy. Policymakers, especially those in developing countries, are interested in attracting multinational production (MP) since multinational firms use more advanced production technologies and might benefit the host countries in various ways (Javorcik (2004), Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare (2010)). Following this line of thought, the new generation of quantitative models of MP focuses on the transfer of technologies with different Hicks-neutral productivities through multinational activities.==== However, as I show in the data, multinational firms use technologies that also differ in terms of factor intensities, which has received little attention in previous works.====In this paper, I document two empirical regularities about the capital-labor ratio of local and multinational firms from 22 countries. First, larger firms use more capital-intensive technologies, which I refer to as the “size effect.” Second, within the same industry and country of production, firms originating from capital-abundant countries use more capital-intensive technologies, which I call the “technology origin effect.” Multinational firms can bring technologies of different capital intensities into host countries either because they are larger firms that use more capital-intensive production techniques, or because their technologies originate in countries with different capital abundance.====Based on the empirical facts, I develop a quantitative framework for modeling multinational production with non-neutral technologies. To match the size effect, I assume a form of technology-capital complementarity, i.e., overall more efficient technologies require relatively more capital. To match the technology origin effect, I allow firms to endogenously choose their technologies from a menu of capital- and labor-intensive technologies before they become multinationals. Beyond the micro-structure that generates heterogeneity in firms' capital intensities, the trade and MP structure of the model resembles that of Arkolakis et al. (2018). Therefore, the model is rich enough to match aggregate statistics such as bilateral MP and trade shares. Overall, the model provides a quantitative framework for understanding the impact of MP with non-neutral technologies on aggregate outcomes such as MP patterns, factor prices and income shares.====The model has rich implications on MP patterns as well as the distributional consequences of MP liberalization. First, I show analytically that firms from capital-abundant countries tend to adopt more capital-intensive technologies because of endogenous technology choices. This, in turn, creates larger endogenous MP costs for firms investing in countries with relative factor prices more different from their home countries. This mechanism can help to explain the negative relationship between the bilateral MP sales and the difference in capital abundance between home and host countries in the data (also see Fajgelbaum et al. (2015)). Second, because firms differ in their capital intensities, MP liberalization reallocates factors across firms and affects the relative demand for capital and labor and thus the equilibrium labor shares.====To understand the quantitative implications of the model, I parameterize the model to match the size and technology origin effects estimated from the micro data as well as aggregate bilateral trade and MP shares in 37 countries in 1996–2001. Though the model does not directly target the factor prices in each country, it captures the cross-country variation in these prices well. With the calibrated model, I perform a model-based decomposition and show that the endogenous technology choice mechanism can explain most of the negative relationship between bilateral MP sales and the difference in capital abundance between the home and host countries.====I then use the calibrated model to understand the distributional consequences of MP. In particular, I estimate the change in MP frictions from 1996 to 2001 to a later period, 2006–2011 and find that the reduction in MP frictions leads to an overall decline in labor shares. On average, the model predicts a 1.2-percentage-point average decline in the labor shares across my sample countries, which is around 56% of what is observed in the data. The model also replicates a negative relationship between the change in a country's labor share and the change in the foreign affiliates' output share observed in the data. This is because of two reasons. First, inward MP brings in productive firms from foreign countries which are also capital-intensive (technology-capital complementarity). They crowd out less productive labor-intensive domestic firms and raise the relative demand for capital. Second, because MP mostly originates from capital-abundant countries, new foreign affiliates in capital-scarce countries tend to use more capital-intensive technologies than the local firms due to endogenous technology choices. A model-based decomposition shows that the technology-capital complementarity explains around 75% of the predicted average labor share decline, while the endogenous technology choice mechanism is particularly important for understanding the decline in the emerging economies.====Besides introducing non-neutral technologies to the quantitative MP models, my paper contributes to several other strands of literature. First, the size effect is closely related to the literature on “factor-biased productivities.” In a recent paper, Burstein and Vogel (2017) point out that trade liberalization leads to an increase in the skill-premium, because more productive firms are more skill-intensive (technology-skill complementarity) and trade reallocates factors towards more productive firms within sectors, which they refer to as the “skill-biased productivity” mechanism. Though it is well known that larger firms are more capital intensive (see Oi and Idson (1999), Bernard et al. (2007)), previous research has not considered its implication in the setting of global firms. I embed this mechanism into a multi-country, general-equilibrium MP and trade model and quantify its importance in understanding the distributional consequences of globalization.====The technology origin effect connects with the literature on directed technical change (Acemoglu (2003a,b, 2015)). The key insight from this literature is that the direction of technical change caters to the factor prices in countries where they are most likely to be applied. I embed a similar idea in a quantitative MP model, where I show that multinational firms endogenously choose technologies that cater to their home countries' factor prices. This prediction is consistent with firm-level evidence, while the strength of the mechanism can be calibrated using firm-level data together with aggregate data.====The technology origin effect is also related to an earlier literature on “inappropriate technology.” Since Eckaus (1955), development economists have been concerned that technologies developed in the capital-abundant countries are “inappropriate” in the capital-scarce developing world, which can lead to “underemployment problems.” A few studies in the 1970s tried to test the hypothesis that multinational firms from advanced countries used more capital-intensive technologies than local firms in the developing countries. However, due to a lack of large firm-level datasets, the literature turned to case studies involving a few dozens of firms, with no consensus on the validity of this hypothesis.==== I use comprehensive micro data and modern econometric techniques and provide support for the hypothesis. Though the quantitative model does not feature underemployment, it predicts that FDI liberalization can potentially lower workers' wages in the host countries, which resonates with the “underemployment problem”.====My quantitative analyses show that MP liberalization is crucial for understanding the global decline of labor shares. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) first document this trend and they argue that the main explanation for this phenomenon is the decline in prices of investment goods.==== As Oberfield and Raval (2014) point out, mechanisms that work solely through factor prices cannot account for the decline of labor shares if the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is below one, as they estimate using plant-level data. When calibrating my model, I provide a model-consistent estimate of the elasticity of substitution, which is also smaller than one and confirms the findings in Oberfield and Raval (2014).====Though Oberfield and Raval (2014) emphasized the role of technological change in the decline of labor shares, they are silent on the drivers of such changes. In contrast, I show that globalization can lead to reallocation of factors across firms, which leads to “biased technological change” at the aggregate level. Using panel data on establishments and firms, Autor et al. (2017) decompose the change in aggregate labor shares into within-firm and between-firm components. They show that the between-firm component is crucial for explaining the labor share decline. The quantitative model I develop captures the between-firm reallocation effects and provides a multi-country framework for quantifying the impact of policies and technologies on the labor shares through this mechanism.====My paper also contributes to the literature on firms' heterogeneity in input usage. Following the seminal work of Melitz (2003), the literature has focused mostly on firms' heterogeneity in their Hicks-neutral productivities. The more recent literature has acknowledged firms' heterogeneity in other dimensions such as input usage.==== I show that a firm's capital intensity is systematically correlated with its size and its home country's capital abundance. The quantitative model rationalizes both empirical regularities and can be used to understand the distributional consequences of MP. Of course, multinational firms may differ from domestic firms in their relative usage of other inputs, such as skilled labor, to which my data unfortunately do not speak. However, my model can be used to analyze the impact of MP on the skill premium where data permit.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I document the two empirical regularities. I develop the quantitative framework for modeling MP with non-neutral technologies in the Section 3. I then calibrate the model and perform counterfactual analysis in 4 Calibration, 5 Multinational production and the labor shares and conclude in Section 7. I discuss sensitivity of the calibration and counterfactuals with respect to model parameters in the appendix and relegate details about the data, proofs, and additional empirical and quantitative results to the online appendix.",Multinational production with non-neutral technologies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300131,14 January 2020,2020,Research Article,193.0

We characterize the conditions under which pools of small economies can be sustainable LOLRs. In addition, we assess the ability of China - a country with ample reserves - to be a sustainable international LOLR.","Following the last financial crisis, there has been a renewed interest in designing last-resort lending arrangements among countries. For example, since 2008, China has entered into more than 50 bilateral agreements that can be used to obtain lending of last resort (LOLR). Argentina, Pakistan and Venezuela have already used China's facilities.==== While there exists a literature started by Bagehot (1878) analyzing the usefulness of lending of last resort, the issue of sustainability of international LOLR arrangements has not been explored within a quantitative macro framework. This paper fills the gap.====We study a small open economy whose banking system borrows from international financial markets to finance domestic production. Banks can default and a costly-state-verification friction generates an endogenous spread between banks' cost of funds and the exogenous risk free rate. The model has the “liability dollarization” channel surveyed in Mendoza (2016) as debt is denominated in units of tradables and collateral is posted in terms of nontradables (capital). Adverse financial shocks increase the probability of bank failures, lower banks' access to external funds and trigger a negative financial accelerator mechanism à la Bernanke et al. (1999), which is specially intense when banks are highly leveraged.==== As in the data, systemic banking crises in the model are infrequent events, featuring a sharp rise in spreads, a reversal of the current account and a drop in aggregate output, investment and consumption.====In the model, the LOLR commits to partially finance the banks during the financial crises.==== The LOLR allows the distressed banking sector to borrow at an interest rate lower than what private lenders would have charged without the intervention. This policy is effective at helping the banking sector to cope with financial distress and mitigates the negative financial accelerator. However, the anticipation of such interventions encourages banks to take more leverage ex-ante. We solve the model with global methods to capture this moral hazard.====LOLR policies generate a tradeoff between financial fragility (due to more highly leveraged banks) and milder crises since the policies are effective once in a crisis. For our calibration the crisis mitigation effect dominates the moral hazard problem and the economy is better off having access to a lender of last resort.====The previous result takes us to the question of how to implement the LOLR. Bagehot proposed the central bank to be the LOLR. However, many central banks cannot act as successful last-resort lenders because their financial sector borrows in foreign currency (usually in dollars) and their reserves are not large enough.==== Thus, we study international LOLR arrangements. First, we analyze pools of small economies as international LOLRs. In every period each member country pays participation premiums to the pool. Disbursements of the pool are payments made by the LOLR due to bank defaults in member countries. This is similar to a tax-financed LOLR, which in practice is how Ireland, Portugal and Spain supported their domestic financial systems during most of the 2008 financial crisis (Santos, 2014; Zeissler et al., 2015). Second, we study whether a country with ample reserves like China can be a sustainable international LOLR.====We show that without initial contributions of reserves, pools of small economies do not seem to be feasible arrangements for lending of last resort as they need an unrealistically large number of uncorrelated countries to have small probabilities of failure. We also show that for initial contributions of reserves of at least 4% of domestic output per-country, pools of as few as five highly correlated countries can be a sustainable LOLR.====In addition, we confirm the ability of China to be an international LOLR. We input into the model the ratio of China's foreign reserves to the total GDP of the countries that have signed lending agreements with China over the last nine years.==== Model simulations show that, as long as China receives some compensation from the insured countries, it is able to provide the levels of liquidity support documented by Laeven and Valencia (2018) with zero probability of failure.====Obstfeld et al. (2009) hypothesized that the scale of reserves needed to backstop financial crises in emerging markets surpassed the resources of the multilateral organizations and all but the largest reserve holders in the world. We confirm that the largest reserve holders can play the role of international LOLR. Thus, the recent Chinese initiatives seem to benefit many countries that can avoid reserve accumulation as a costly self-insurance mechanism against domestic financial instability.==== In fact, Aizenman et al., 2011, Aizenman et al., 2015a, Aizenman et al., 2015b confirm that long-lasting LOLR agreements lead to lower reserve accumulation.====In terms of methodology, our paper contributes to the literature by developing a quantitative macro framework to think about the usefulness and sustainability of different types of LOLR arrangements. While most LOLR papers focus on setups with multiple equilibria and analyze qualitative properties (see, for example, Goodhart and Huang, 2000, Corsetti et al., 2006, Morris and Shin, 2006 or Bocola and Lorenzoni, 2018), we study a financial frictions setup that allows a quantitative analysis of LOLR policy. Our paper connects with models of financial frictions between borrowers and lenders with endogenous accelerator mechanisms (like Bernanke et al., 1999, Christiano et al., 2014, Fernández and Gulan, 2015, Gertler and Karadi, 2011 or Akinci and Queralto, 2016 among many others). Like Bianchi (2016) or Bianchi et al. (2016) we solve the model with global methods to capture the trade-off between the ex-post benefits of liquidity support and the ex-ante moral hazard in the banking sector triggered by the LOLR.====The paper proceeds as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe the model and the LOLR policies that we study. Section 4 discusses the calibration. Section 5 analyzes banking crises and lending of last resort policies. Section 6 studies the sustainability of an international LOLR with an application to China.

In a sample of emerging economies we find that both, sovereign and private interest rate spreads are countercyclical. This paper presents a model of a ","Sovereign default is a recurrent phenomenon in emerging economies. Default episodes are typically associated with severe recessions, characterized by sharp drops in output, investment, and imports. Recent empirical studies further suggest that sovereign default is followed by worsening conditions for external finance for the private sector. Arteta and Hale (2008) show that foreign credit to non-financial firms contracts sharply in the aftermath of sovereign debt crises.==== Ağca and Celasun (2012) find that higher external sovereign debt in emerging markets translates into higher borrowing costs for the private sector, and much more so in countries that have experienced sovereign default episodes in the past. What is the explanation for these links between sovereign debt and the private sector's access to foreign credit? And how do these relations affect macroeconomic conditions around default episodes?====To address these questions, we investigate the dynamic interrelations between sovereign and private credit risks in emerging economies and their effects on macroeconomic outcomes. We first document several business-cycle facts about interest rate spreads on sovereign and private external debt for a sample of emerging market economies, and we consider the behavior of these interest rate spreads during Argentina's sovereign debt crisis in 2002. In line with earlier literature, the default crisis was accompanied by strong declines in government spending and imports and by an increase in sovereign and private interest rate spreads. Over the business cycle, private and sovereign spreads are countercyclical, which is a robust phenomenon that is independent of the inclusion of default episodes.====We then build a dynamic, stochastic model of a small open economy to account for these observations. Our modeling approach follows the recent quantitative literature on sovereign debt in incomplete markets economies with an endogenous default choice of the government, e.g., Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) and Arellano (2008). The model has domestic households, domestic firms producing final goods and intermediate goods, a domestic government and foreign lenders. Final goods firms produce their output with imperfectly substitutable domestic and foreign intermediate goods. A fraction of imported intermediate goods must be financed by external credit. Since firms face idiosyncratic productivity and default cost shocks, their credit is subject to default risk, so that risk-neutral international investors charge a premium on private debt. Households value private consumption, leisure and a public good provided by the government. The government acts in the interest of domestic households, it levies a linear sales tax and borrows internationally so as to smoothen the provision of the public good and to balance fluctuations in tax revenues over the business cycle. In any period, the government has the option to default on the outstanding debt, which gives rise to an endogenous interest rate spread on sovereign debt. In the event of default, the government is temporarily excluded from international financial markets, in which case it must finance public expenditures solely from taxes.====In a quantitative application to Argentina we show that our theoretical framework mimics the empirical facts of a typical emerging market economy, in particular countercyclical sovereign and private spreads, volatile imports, and deep recessions in default. Moreover, and in line with the empirical evidence of procyclical fiscal policy in emerging market economies (e.g., Talvi and Vegh, 2005; Ilzetzki and Vegh, 2008), taxes are countercyclical and government spending is procyclical.====Similar to Cuadra et al. (2010),==== the procyclicality of fiscal policy is a direct consequence of countercyclical sovereign default risk. If the economy enters a recession, external public debt becomes more expensive due to the higher sovereign default risk, and this induces the government to raise tax rates so as to finance public expenditures. This procyclicality of fiscal policy is important for macroeconomic amplification in our model: Higher tax rates in recessions depress firms' profitability even further and induce more firms to default on their external debt, which endogenously lowers aggregate productivity. Moreover, higher private spreads reduce import demand. Both effects deepen the recession and amplify sovereign default risk. In case of a default, by not repaying debt the government is able to reduce tax rates, which stimulates profitability, reduces the private interest rate spread and fosters the recovery of the economy.====To explore the quantitative importance of the dynamic feedback mechanism between tax policy and private credit risk, we run a counterfactual experiment and shut down the endogenous tax response. Our simulations show that an exogenously fixed tax rate strongly decreases the variance of the private interest rate as well as the variance of aggregate productivity. As a result, imports, output, and private consumption become substantially less volatile. In the absence of an endogenous tax response, default events are characterized by less severe recessions, but the recovery after a default is slower. We find that in a typical default event, the endogenous interaction between tax policy and credit risks reduces aggregate productivity by additional 1.8 percentage points. The private spread increases by additional 4.8 percentage points, imports drop by additional 10.1 percentage points, and output falls by additional 3.3 percentage points.====Our paper builds on the classic paper by Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) and the quantitative contributions of Arellano (2008) and Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) and introduces firm heterogeneity and private default into a model of sovereign debt and default.==== We contribute to the literature by quantifying the macroeconomic amplification generated by the endogenous interaction between fiscal policy and credit risks. Our framework is closely related to Mendoza and Yue (2012) who focus on the question why sovereign default episodes are associated with deep recessions. They consider a model of sovereign debt, in which firms produce final output from domestically produced and imported intermediate goods. A share of the imported intermediate goods is financed by external debt. Different from our setup, they abstract from endogenous tax policy and endogenous private default risk and assume that firms are always able to borrow at the risk-free rate, which is at odds with the evidence.==== Furthermore, all firms and the government are simultaneously excluded from international financial markets if the government chooses to default. This in turn causes firms to substitute away from imports towards domestically produced goods, generating output costs and severe recessions. In our model, sovereign defaults are also associated with severe contractions in imports and output. However, these factual reactions do not require to shut all firms out of financial markets together with the defaulting government. Instead, the default decisions of private firms make aggregate productivity an endogenous outcome. In recessions, more private firms default, which reduces aggregate productivity and generates an endogenous output cost of sovereign default. Importantly, the endogenous reaction of fiscal policy amplifies this mechanism: As the government raises taxes in response to higher sovereign borrowing costs, the default rate of private firms increases, which in turn reduces aggregate productivity and deepens the recession.====Similar to our paper, Arellano et al. (2019) explore the consequences of the joint dynamics of sovereign and private default risk for real economic activity, but in contrast to our paper they focus on the role of financial intermediation and apply their model to Italy. In a related contribution, de Ferra (2018) develops a two-sector framework with a labor income tax to study the dynamic interaction between fiscal policy and corporate credit risk for the case of Italy. Arellano et al. (2016) argue that the risk of government interference in private debt markets creates a link between sovereign and private borrowing costs which is in accordance with the experience in the European debt crisis. Similar to our model, Aguiar et al. (2009) show that governments in closer proximity to default raise taxes with adverse consequences for the private sector, but they do not consider private default.====We abstract from the role of domestically held debt, often on the balance sheet of banks, that is also discussed as a potential source of amplification. For instance, in theoretical contributions based on finite–horizon economies, Brutti (2011) and Gennaioli et al. (2014) argue that sovereign default harms the balance sheets of domestic banks or private investors, which triggers contractions in credit and investment. Engler and Große-Steffen (2016), Niemann and Pichler (2017), and Sosa-Padilla (2018) build quantitative stochastic general equilibrium models with a similar feature. While this channel may be important in several developed and emerging economies, Arteta and Hale (2008) show that the decline in external credit during sovereign debt crises is concentrated in the non-financial sector, which motivates why we abstract from financial intermediaries in our model.====Besides the banking channel, other contributions also consider spill-over effects of sovereign default on external credit of firms. Andreasen (2015) suggests a signaling mechanism, based on the idea that the government's repayment decision provides new information regarding the institutional quality (such as recovery rates), which affects the financial conditions of private firms. Sandleris (2014) argues that sovereign default can trigger a collapse of private credit even when no debt is held domestically. In his model, a sovereign default reduces the firms' collateral value, which limits their borrowing capacity. Arellano and Kocherlakota (2014) propose a reverse mechanism: due to informational frictions in private credit markets, private default crises can emerge as a coordination equilibrium, which possibly triggers a sovereign debt crisis.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we document empirical evidence about sovereign and private credit risk in emerging market economies. In Section 3, we describe the model framework, define the recursive equilibrium and explain the main determinants of sovereign and private default risks. In Section 4 we calibrate the model to the Argentine economy to illustrate the quantitative significance of the interplay between sovereign and private credit risks that our model generates.

This motivates the study of the agglomeration forces that give rise to concentration. The composition of economic activity also varies considerably across cities. This is evident from ==== ranking “America's smartest cities” and the use of place names like Wall Street and Silicon Valley as shorthand for industries. Who lives in more productive cities and what they do there should inform our understanding of how agglomeration economies work. But most theories of cities, to the extent that they consider the spatial distributions of skills and sectors, are dichotomous in nature: individuals are either skilled or unskilled and cities either perform one function or all functions. These low-dimensional accounts are not well suited to interpret data exhibiting much richer variation.====What governs the distributions of skills and sectors across cities? Who lives where and what do they do there? These are challenging questions. In this paper, we develop an analytic approach we term the comparative advantage of cities. Our aim is to provide the simplest theoretical framework capable of providing unified answers to these questions and then to take our model's predictions to the data. We introduce a model of many cities, many skills, and many sectors, and we show that it fits the cross-section of US cities well.====In our spatial-equilibrium model, the comparative advantage of cities is jointly governed by the comparative advantage of individuals and their locational choices. Cities are symmetric ====, so cross-city heterogeneity is an emergent outcome. Agglomeration economies make cities with larger, more skilled populations exhibit higher total factor productivity (TFP). Locations within cities exhibit heterogeneity in their innate desirability, as is customary in land-use models (Fujita and Thisse, 2002, Ch 3). These cities are populated by heterogeneous individuals with a continuum of skill types, and these individuals may be employed in a continuum of sectors. Comparative advantage causes more skilled individuals to work in more skill-intensive sectors, as in Ricardo-Roy models (Costinot and Vogel, 2015). While those models of international trade assume exogenous endowments, we study the comparative advantage of cities in an environment in which cities' factor supplies are endogenously determined by the choices of mobile individuals. There is a complementarity between individual income and locational attractiveness, so more skilled individuals are more willing to pay for more attractive locations and occupy these locations in equilibrium, as in the differential-rents model of Sattinger (1979).====In equilibrium, agglomeration, individuals' comparative advantage, and locational heterogeneity within cities combine to deliver a rich set of novel predictions. Agglomeration causes larger cities to have higher TFP, which makes a given location within a larger city more attractive than a location otherwise of the same innate desirability within a smaller city. For example, the best location within a larger city is more attractive than the best location within a smaller city due to the difference in TFP. Since more skilled individuals occupy more attractive locations, larger cities are skill-abundant. The most skilled individuals in the population live only in the largest city and more skilled individuals are relatively more prevalent in larger cities. By individuals' comparative advantage, the most skill-intensive sectors are located exclusively in the largest cities and larger cities specialize in the production of skill-intensive output. Our model therefore predicts an urban hierarchy of skills and sectors. Under slightly stronger assumptions, larger cities will be absolutely larger in all sectors.====As we discuss in Section 2, prior theories describing cities' sectoral composition have overwhelmingly focused on the polar cases in which cities are either completely specialized “industry towns” or all produce the same composite output. The former is starkly at odds with the data, while the latter makes no substantive prediction. Our theory predicts that cities are incompletely specialized across sectors due to incomplete skill sorting: the trade-off between city-level TFP differences and within-city locational desirability differences can make individuals of a given skill level indifferent between locations in different cities. At the same time, our model relates the pattern of specialization to cities' observable characteristics. It makes strong, testable predictions about the distributions of skills and sectors across cities.====We examine the model's predictions about the distribution of skills and sectors across US cities using data from the 2000 Census of Population, County Business Patterns, and Occupational Employment Statistics described in Section 4. We use two empirical approaches to characterize cities' skill and sectoral distributions. The first regresses a city's log sectoral employment on its log total population. More skilled groups and more skill-intensive sectors should exhibit higher population elasticities. The second examines whether the distributions exhibit the monotone likelihood ratio property, as per Costinot (2009), by comparing a pair of skills or sectors across a pair of cities.==== For example, comparing two cities and two sectors, the skill-intensive sector should have relatively larger employment in the larger city. To characterize sectoral size, we simply compare sectors' employment levels across cities.====Section 5 reports the results, which provide support for our model's predictions about the pattern of skills and sectors across cities. Characterizing skills in terms of three or nine educational groups, we find that larger cities are skill-abundant. Characterizing sectors in terms of 19 industrial categories or 22 occupational categories, we find that larger cities specialize in skill-intensive sectors. Our model's predictions are generally borne out by the data and are statistically significant. If deviations from our model's predictions are idiosyncratic rather than systematic, the empirical success rate should increase with aggregation over groups of cities. This is indeed the case. There is systematic variation in cities' skill and sectoral distributions that is consistent with the predictions of our theory.====Our account of the distributions of skills and sectors across cities has implications for both research and policy. We find systematic sorting of finely differentiated educational attainment levels across cities. This means that researchers examining spatial variation in binary college/non-college terms report outcomes that partly reflect cross-city compositional differences within these broad educational categories. Similarly, we find that a city's sectoral composition is systematically related to its population size. This means that research designs exploiting cross-city variation in sectoral composition, à la Bartik (1991), that do not control for population size are relying upon size-driven variation, not just idiosyncratic circumstances, for identification. Our model also has potentially interesting implications for welfare. For example, our model of spatial sorting across locations means that biased technical change has asymmetric welfare consequences. In our setting, skill-biased technical change raises attractive locations' rental prices without increasing less attractive locations' prices, while unskilled-biased technical change raises rental prices everywhere. Finally, due to the most skilled individuals residing only in the largest cities, the range of skills and thus the range of welfare is greater in larger cities. These differences likely shape local policymakers' challenges and choices.====In sum, we develop a theory of the distributions of skills and sectors across cities of different sizes and show that it fits the US data well. The model combines elements of urban land-use theory and assignment models of comparative advantage. These are a natural foundation for a theory of a system of cities because locational heterogeneity within and across cities leads the distribution of skills to exhibit the monotone likelihood ratio property. This arises not by assumption but instead as an emergent property of the equilibrium that brings in its wake similar implications for the distribution of sectors. This high-dimensional theory provides a basis for what is, relative to the prior literature, a richer empirical examination of the distributions of skills, occupations, and industries across cities of different sizes.",The comparative advantage of cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300106,10 January 2020,2020,Research Article,196.0

This “missing disinflation” puzzle, followed more recently by missing inflation (see Constancio, 2015), has drawn renewed attention on the fundamental forces behind the loosening of the inflation-output tradeoff observed in advanced countries since the mid-1980s.====Improvement in monetary policy making, moving towards enhanced central bank independence and inflation targeting, has certainly helped anchor inflation expectations and contributed to the growing stability of inflation over the past 30 years. Recent empirical studies have also pointed to another, more structural change: controlling for inflation expectations, the magnitude of the increase in inflation resulting from a given expansion of domestic demand has become significantly lower today than it was in the early 1980s.==== Among the possible explanations for that structural transformation, globalization has stood as one of the prime suspects. Intuitively, as openness to international trade increases, some producers adjust their pricing behavior for fear of losing their market share. This should in principle affect how inflation responds to the slack/tightness of the domestic economy. However, despite its appeal, it has proven difficult to formalize this simple story.====In this paper, I provide a novel analytical framework that can replicate the declining sensitivity of domestic inflation to real activity in response to globalization. I include three ingredients in an otherwise standard two-country new-Keynesian model: ====, due to oligopolistic competition; ====, due to fixed penetration costs; and ====. I define globalization as a fall in international per-unit trade costs. The set of competitors endogenously changes as it becomes profitable for new firms to export (====). By the ====, only the most productive firms choose to export; these firms also happen to be the largest ones.==== Because of the ====, the largest firms are the ones most prone to act strategically by absorbing marginal cost movements into their desired markup to preserve their profit. Thus, they transmit less marginal cost fluctuations into price adjustments than do smaller firms.====Eventually, openness to international trade gives rise to two forces: (i) pro-competitive pressures, as foreign competitors penetrate the domestic market, and (ii) greater concentration, as the weight of large firms in domestic production increases. If the concentration force dominates, then globalization strengthens the overall degree of real rigidities,==== which translates into inflation responding less to domestic slack. I further demonstrate why each assumption is necessary, but not sufficient in itself, to weaken the relationship between inflation and domestic slack in response to globalization. To establish this point, the mechanics can be decomposed into two parts: (1) How does the elasticity of inflation to marginal cost vary with the market structure? (2) How does the market structure, i.e. the number of firms and their relative market power, change with globalization?==== The view that the level of competition might affect the responsiveness of inflation to domestic fluctuations presumes that firms act strategically by adjusting their markup in response to the perceived competition.====To capture the strategic interactions channel, I relax the standard fixed price elasticity of demand assumption. To that end, I introduce ==== at the sector level, stating that firms compete in quantities, ==== la Cournot, within sectors.==== Firms internalize their influence on the sectoral output when setting their optimal plans. As a result, the perceived price-elasticity of demand, and subsequently the desired markup,==== vary with firms' market share.==== Large firms (with high market power) exhibit greater strategic complementarities than small firms. They have more elastic markups and do less transmit cost shocks in the form of price adjustments.====Coupled with nominal rigidities, the degree of firms' market power determines the strength of the relationship between inflation and domestic slack. As in Woodford (2003), for a given degree of nominal rigidities, the stronger the strategic interactions (also referred to as real rigidities), the weaker the relationship between inflation and the real marginal cost. Intuitively, large firms respond to a marginal cost shock by absorbing part of that shock into their desired markup, which mechanically reduces the pass-through of the real marginal cost into inflation. Thus, if an economy is populated by a few large firms (in each sector), the buffer-effect stemming from strategic markup adjustments is highly pronounced. On the contrary, if firms' market share becomes infinitely small, strategic interactions vanish. Knowing that the link between domestic inflation and real activity loosens when firms have more market power, the remaining question regards the impact of globalization on firms' market share/market power.==== The answer depends on how globalization is identified. One approach is to model globalization as an increase in the overall number of goods, ====, assuming they are all symmetric. More competitors entail a decline in each firm's market share (==== = 1/====). Such a definition of globalization leads to a decline in firms' market power and consequently dampens the real rigidities. Thus, inflation reacts more strongly to marginal cost movements. This effect is the purely ==== impact of globalization.====My approach instead allows for ==== across firms. Following the new trade literature, I assume fixed penetration costs on the export market, hence the ====. With those assumptions, globalization might favor concentration through the emergence of “big players”. When the iceberg trade cost falls, only highly productive firms choose to export, and highly productive firms are also large ones.==== Therefore, new firms that enter the export market have more market power than the average firm. They are consequently more prone to act strategically by adjusting their desired markup. Hence, in the presence of nominal rigidities in the short run, their price adjustments respond less to cyclical fluctuations in the real marginal cost. At the aggregate level, the proportion of large firms in producing domestic output increases with globalization. As a result, domestic inflation becomes less responsive to domestic slack. In a new-Keynesian setup, this means that the Phillips curve flattens.====The mechanism that I highlight suggests that in the long run, economies have become more concentrated, consistently with recent work by Autor et al. (2017). And this concentration has translated into higher markups at the sector level. This ==== channel==== strengthens the overall degree of real rigidities in the economy and can counterbalance the ==== force stemming from the entry of foreign competitors. I parametrize the model to replicate simple features of the U.S. economy. Globalization could explain around one fifth to one third of the flattening of the Phillips curve from the early 1980s to mid-2000s. The last section brings indirect empirical evidence supporting each step of the theoretical result.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the model. Section 4 solves for the steady state. Section 5 derives a linear approximation of the inflation/real marginal cost nexus around the steady state (i.e. the new-Keynesian Phillips curve). Section 6 provides a quantitative example of the impact of globalization. Section 7 reports indirect empirical evidence supporting the theoretical predictions of the model.","Globalization, market structure and inflation dynamics",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199620300118,9 January 2020,2020,Research Article,197.0

First, it shapes the nature of forces constraining expansion of ==== Agreements (FTAs). The constraining force is a ==== incentive of FTA non-members under relatively high bindings but an exclusion incentive of FTA members under relatively low bindings. Second, multilateral tariff binding liberalization shapes the role played by PTAs in the attainment of global free trade. Initially, tariff binding liberalization leads to ==== (CU) formation in equilibrium but in a way that undermines the pursuit of global free trade. However, further tariff binding liberalization leads to FTA formation in equilibrium and in a way that facilitates the attainment of global free trade. Our theoretical analysis also has implications regarding recent empirical discussions over the relative merits of FTAs versus CUs.","The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), codified as part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its inception, has governed global trade liberalization since 1948. A key pillar of GATT is the Most Favored Nation (MFN) principle. This nondiscrimination principle requires a country levy the same tariff, the so-called MFN ====, on other GATT/WTO members. Most prominently, various GATT negotiation rounds from the 1947 Geneva Round through the 1994 Uruguay Round generated substantial MFN tariff concessions with countries committing to MFN ==== that cap their maximum MFN applied tariff. And, despite the stalled WTO Doha Round of multilateral negotiations, two plurilateral sectoral agreements featuring zero MFN tariff bindings have continued expanding, via increasing member and/or product coverage, since 1995. Indeed, these agreements, the Information Technology Act (ITA) and the “zero-for-zero” pharmaceutical initiative, are a prototype for current negotiations on an Environmental Goods Agreement.==== Thus, ultimately, MFN tariff binding concessions have been and continue to be a cornerstone of global trade liberalization.====Nevertheless, directly contravening its non-discrimination pillar, GATT allows discriminatory liberalization through Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). Specifically, GATT Article XXIV allows countries to eliminate tariffs between themselves if they do not raise barriers on other countries. Countries can form Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and keep sovereign discretion over “external tariffs” on non-members or form Customs Unions (CUs) and set a common external tariff on non-members. Although relatively rare before the Uruguay Round, PTAs have proliferated thereafter. The tension between these discriminatory and non-discriminatory modes of liberalization spawned and, through failure of the current Doha Round, has sustained a large literature. In particular, this literature focuses on understanding how the discriminatory nature of PTAs impacts the degree of global trade liberalization that would otherwise arise in terms of non-discriminatory MFN applied tariffs set by countries either individually or through global negotiation rounds.====The literature has long understood that PTAs impact the extent of MFN tariff liberalization and hence the ultimate degree of global liberalization. Yet, it has largely ignored that the extent of MFN tariff liberalization can impact PTA formation and hence the ultimate degree of global tariff liberalization. This is despite real world tariff liberalization often occurring through tariff binding reductions that directly impact PTA formation incentives by changing the MFN applied tariffs levied in the absence of a PTA. This observation raises the first key question of our paper: how does a continual worldwide reduction in tariff bindings impact the equilibrium path of PTA formation?====The literature typically views the classic building bloc-stumbling bloc issue as whether PTA formation improves or hurts the prospects of global free trade ==== to the outcome under multilateral liberalization. However, in practice, multilateral liberalization happens in short background bursts via various global negotiation rounds or plurilateral agreements like the ITA. Conversely, countries continuously form PTAs, choosing between FTAs and CUs, on the surface of the global trade policy landscape. Thus, an alternative view of the building bloc-stumbling bloc issue, and perhaps a more informative view, asks the following question: does a given type of PTA help or hurt the prospects of global free trade relative to the outcome if this type of PTA was banned? The second key question of our paper asks how this answer depends on tariff binding liberalization.====We build a three country dynamic model of PTA formation where countries form PTAs over time. For our underlying trade model, we use a competing exporters model where each country imports one good from the other two countries and production technologies exhibit increasing cost. To focus on the impact of continual reductions in tariff bindings, our model features symmetric countries and a symmetric tariff binding. In turn, we investigate how equilibrium PTA formation, and specifically the attainment of global free trade, changes with continual reductions in the symmetric tariff binding.====A dynamic trade-off drives the equilibrium type of PTA (i.e. FTA or CU). On one hand, CU members benefit from coordinating their external tariffs. Myopically, CU members, or “CU insiders” in the terminology of Fig. 1 used hereafter, benefit from internalizing the well known negative intra-PTA externality of tariff complementarity.==== And, from a farsighted perspective, each CU insider has veto power over expanding the CU to include the CU outsider and thereby reaching global free trade. CU members value this veto power when they hold a ==== or, in other words, benefit from excluding the CU outsider from expansion to global free trade. They value this veto power because, in contrast, each “FTA insider” can form their own subsequent FTA with the “FTA outsider” and precipitate FTA expansion to global free trade. Thus, the benefits of coordinating CU external tariffs consist of both myopic and farsighted CU coordination benefits.====On the other hand, FTA formation affords an FTA flexibility benefit. Unlike CU formation that gives veto power over subsequent PTA formation to both CU insiders, each FTA insider has the flexibility to form their own subsequent FTA with the “FTA outsider” and become the “hub” with sole preferential access to the other two “spoke” countries. Ultimately, the discount factor mediates the dynamic trade-off between the CU coordination and FTA flexibility benefits.====Our first main insight is that tariff binding liberalization fundamentally shapes the equilibrium path of PTA formation. With high tariff bindings, PTA formation leads to global free trade with the discount factor determining whether this happens via CUs or FTAs. Intuitively, CU insiders do not hold a CU exclusion incentive under high tariff bindings, and hence do not hold a farsighted CU coordination benefit, because the CU outsider's high tariffs make CU expansion to global free trade attractive for CU insiders.==== Thus, the FTA flexibility benefit outweighs (is outweighed by) the myopic CU coordination benefit and FTAs (CUs) emerge in equilibrium for relatively patient (impatient) countries.====Once tariff binding liberalization produces intermediate tariff bindings then, regardless of the discount factor, CU formation emerges in equilibrium but does not lead to global free trade. Because the CU outsider must lower their tariffs once tariff binding liberalization pushes below the unilaterally optimal Nash tariffs, CU insiders receive tariff concessions from the CU outsider. This soon generates a CU exclusion incentive, and hence a farsighted CU coordination benefit, with CU insiders permanently excluding the CU outsider. Moreover, this farsighted CU coordination benefit is sufficiently strong that the myopic and farsighted CU coordination benefits always outweigh the FTA flexibility benefit.====Nevertheless, further tariff binding liberalization leads to an equilibrium re-emergence of FTAs and the attainment of global free trade. Eventually, relatively low tariff bindings impinge on the CU insiders' ability to coordinate external tariffs and thereby shrinks their myopic CU coordination benefit. Now, the FTA flexibility benefit outweighs the myopic and farsighted CU coordination benefits for intermediate degrees of patience and, unlike CU formation, equilibrium FTA formation expands to global free trade.====Our second main insight is that tariff binding liberalization influences the role played by the equilibrium type of PTA in attaining global free trade relative to the outcome if this type of PTA was banned. To this end, we introduce the terminology of “PTA stumbling bloc” and “PTA building bloc”. CUs (FTAs) are a “PTA stumbling bloc” if CU (FTA) formation emerges in equilibrium and does not lead to global free trade yet FTA (CU) formation would lead to global free trade in the absence of CUs (FTAs). Similarly, CUs (FTAs) are a “PTA building bloc” if CU (FTA) formation emerges in equilibrium and leads to global free trade yet FTA (CU) formation would not lead to global free trade in the absence of CUs (FTAs). Our key result here is that FTAs can only be PTA building blocs but tariff binding liberalization morphs CUs from PTA building blocs into PTA stumbling blocs.====When FTAs emerge in equilibrium, FTA formation always expands to global free trade and, hence, FTAs cannot be PTA stumbling blocs. Moreover, given CU formation does not expand to global free trade for tariff bindings that generate the CU exclusion incentive, FTAs are PTA building blocs here when they emerge in equilibrium. Two forces constrain the equilibrium emergence of FTAs and, hence, the extent that FTAs are PTA building blocs. For relatively high tariff bindings, a sufficiently impatient FTA outsider holds a ==== and refuses FTA formation: despite global free trade eliminating future discrimination, this is outweighed by the myopic benefit the FTA outsider receives from the tariff complementarity of FTA insiders. But, for relatively low tariff bindings, sufficiently patient FTA insiders hold a ==== and permanently exclude the FTA outsider: despite the myopic benefit of becoming the hub, FTA insiders prefer permanently excluding the FTA outsider in order to avoid the future attainment of global free trade.==== Thus, despite FTAs never acting as PTA stumbling blocs, tariff binding liberalization still shapes the forces that constrain FTA expansion to global free trade.====Like FTAs, CUs can be a PTA building bloc. With high tariff bindings, CU insiders do not hold a CU exclusion incentive and CU formation expands to global free trade. When CUs emerge in equilibrium here, which happens when countries are sufficiently impatient, the FTA outsider holds a dynamic free riding incentive. Thus, CUs are PTA building blocs because FTA formation would not lead to global free trade. However, tariff binding liberalization morphs CUs into PTA stumbling blocs. For the intermediate range of tariff bindings generating a CU exclusion incentive and an equilibrium CU, CUs are PTA stumbling blocs when FTAs would lead to global free trade. For relatively high tariff bindings, this happens when the FTA outsider does not hold a dynamic free riding incentive. And for relatively low tariff bindings, this happens when FTA insiders do not hold a dynamic exclusion incentive.====A possible drawback of our analysis is our exogenous treatment of tariff bindings. Indeed, the literature has theoretical explanations for endogenous tariff bindings. Horn et al. (2010) argue that costly contracting makes a state-contingent agreement unattractive. Also, uncertainty over future political economy concerns can motivate a demand for flexibility over future applied tariff setting (e.g. Bagwell and Staiger (2005), Amador and Bagwell (2013), Beshkar et al. (2015) and Nicita et al. (2018)). In contrast to these non-PTA based explanations, Lake and Roy (2017) show how tariff bindings negotiated by forward-looking governments bear the imprint of subsequent FTA formation. Nevertheless, as a whole, the literature views tariff binding determination and PTA formation as distinct issues, arguably reflecting a prevailing wisdom that countries did not fully internalize the implications for future PTA formation when they negotiated multilateral binding liberalization. Thus, our tractable analysis seems reasonable in motivating the importance of tariff binding liberalization for the endogenous choice between FTAs and CUs.====Surprisingly few papers have addressed how multilateral tariff liberalization impacts the extent of PTA formation (Freund and Ornelas, 2010). Ethier (1998) argues countries use PTAs as a benign consequence of being left out of earlier rounds of multilateral tariff liberalization. In a repeated game setting, Freund (2000) shows how multilateral tariff liberalization can make an FTA “self-enforcing”.====Lake and Roy (2017) and Nken and Yildiz (2018) represent two recent contributions. Like our paper, Nken and Yildiz (2018) find tariff binding liberalization weakens the FTA non-member free riding incentive. Hence, multilateral tariff liberalization again facilitates FTA expansion. But, unlike our paper, their static framework prevents the exclusion incentive from playing a meaningful role in equilibrium. Contrary to these positive views of multilateral tariff liberalization, Lake and Roy (2017) show how endogenous multilateral tariff bindings generate an FTA exclusion incentive because, like our paper, relatively tight tariff bindings deliver tariff concessions from FTA non-members to FTA members. Ultimately, multilateralism acts as a stumbling bloc to global free trade for Lake and Roy (2017). Unlike our paper, neither Lake and Roy (2017) nor Nken and Yildiz (2018) endogenize countries' choice between FTAs and CUs and hence do not analyze the PTA building bloc and PTA stumbling bloc properties of FTAs and CUs.====A small, but growing, literature investigates the endogenous choice between FTAs and CUs. Riezman (1999) finds CUs can emerge in equilibrium when CU insiders have a CU exclusion incentive but, unlike our analysis, FTAs cannot emerge in equilibrium. Melatos and Woodland (2007) find a similar result even with preference or endowment asymmetries. For Seidmann (2009), the FTA versus CU choice influences how countries bargain over surplus division under global free trade. Melatos and Dunn (2013) and Appelbaum and Melatos (2016) analyze the FTA versus CU choice in, respectively, evolving and uncertain trading environments and Facchini et al. (2012) focus on the role played by income inequality and production structures.==== Lake (2019) shows how the dynamic trade off between FTA flexibility and CU coordination benefits can help explain the prevalence of FTAs over CUs and Lake and Yildiz (2016) show how this trade off can help explain why, in practice, FTAs are intra- and inter-regional while CUs are always intra-regional.====PTA member exclusion incentives and PTA non-member free riding incentives have long been important for theoretical analyses of PTAs and their impact on attaining global free trade.==== However, a given analysis typically relies on one incentive or the other. In Saggi and Yildiz (2010), the FTA non-member free riding incentive is weaker than the incentive to free ride on MFN liberalization and, hence, FTAs can be a “building bloc” to global free trade. In Saggi et al. (2013), CU member exclusion incentives can be stronger than the MFN free riding incentive and, hence, CUs can be a “stumbling bloc” to global free trade. Based on these two papers, Maggi (2014) hypothesizes that CUs, but not FTAs, constrain the prospects of global free trade. But, he argues this conclusion requires a model where countries endogenously choose between CUs and FTAs.====Our model can directly address Maggi's hypothesis. Rather than tie exclusion and free riding incentives to country asymmetries, which are somewhat nebulous in real world applications, we tie them to tariff binding liberalization which has concrete real world interpretations. Further, we build a dynamic model because static models often have difficulty generating FTAs in equilibrium; e.g. countries always choose CUs over FTAs in the static model of Missios et al. (2016). In our dynamic setting, the dynamic trade off between the FTA flexibility and CU coordination benefits determine whether FTAs or CUs emerge in equilibrium. Ultimately, we add nuance to Maggi's hypothesis: in our own terminology, FTAs can only act as a “PTA building bloc” but CUs act as either a “PTA stumbling bloc” or “PTA building bloc”. The overlooked nuance of CUs as a PTA building bloc comes from the possibility that a CU outsider has a weaker free riding incentive than an FTA outsider due to stronger discrimination and weaker tariff complementarity benefits.====Finally, our paper relates to Felbermayr et al. (2018) who document little difference in FTA member external tariffs despite no imposition of a common external tariff. And, given the sizeable misallocation costs of FTA rules of origin (e.g., Conconi et al. (2018)), they make policy recommendations so that FTAs can emulate CUs. However, our analysis makes three points. First, unlike FTA members, CU members ==== higher tariffs that reduce world welfare. Second, one reason FTAs may remain so popular in practice is the flexibility benefit of FTA members to form their own subsequent FTAs. Indeed, third, that FTAs are only PTA building blocs while CUs can be PTA stumbling blocs shows how the FTA flexibility benefit can propel the degree of global trade liberalization beyond that achieved by CUs.====Next, Section 2 describes our model. 3 Equilibrium path of networks: FTA game, 4 Equilibrium path of networks: CU game analyze the “FTA game” and “CU game” where, respectively, countries can only form FTAs or CUs. Section 5 analyzes the “PTA game” that endogenizes countries' choice between FTAs and CUs. Section 6 presents extensions and Section 7 concludes.

At the same time, TRIPS contains two major ==== that grant national governments some discretion in the design and enforcement of their respective IPR policies: the right to use compulsory licensing (CL) to ease consumer access to patented products and the freedom to implement exhaustion policies of their choosing. This paper analyzes how these two key flexibilities available under TRIPS interact with its central obligation, both from the viewpoint of developing countries and global welfare.====Before describing our analytical approach in detail, we discuss the economically relevant institutional aspects of the two TRIPS flexibilities motivating this paper. Consider CL first. As per TRIPS rules, when a country is faced with no or limited access to a patented foreign product, it has the right to issue a compulsory license to someone other than the patent-holder to produce the product.====Article 31 of TRIPS provides conditions under which WTO members can resort to CL of a patent. In particular, this Article stipulates that “ the right holder shall be paid adequate remuneration in the circumstances of each case, taking into account the economic value of the authorization” and that “any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the supply of the domestic market of the Member authorizing such use”.==== Our model incorporates both these key features of Article 31 of TRIPS.====Now consider the policy flexibility available to WTO members with respect to exhaustion of IPRs. Article 6 of TRIPS explicitly states that “nothing in this Agreement shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of intellectual property rights”. Exhaustion policies determine the legality of ==== – i.e. the type of trade that occurs when a product protected by an IPR offered for sale by the right holder in one country is re-sold in another country without the right holder's permission. As is clear, the incentive to engage in such trade naturally arises in the presence of significant international price differences. Furthermore, since parallel trade flows from low-price markets to high-price ones, the exhaustion policies of high-price markets are more consequential than those of low-price ones.==== Accordingly, in our North-South framework we consider the effects of alternative exhaustion policies on the part of the North.==== We examine ==== and ==== exhaustion: under the former policy, the North prohibits parallel imports into its market whereas under the latter policy, it permits them. A key difference between the two exhaustion policies is that under national exhaustion the firm can charge its optimal price in each market whereas under international exhaustion it faces a trade-off: it can either sell only in the North at its optimal price for that market or sell in both markets at a common international price (so as to eliminate the flow of parallel imports into the more lucrative Northern market). As a result, the firm is less inclined to sell in the South when the North implements international exhaustion.====In practice, the two TRIPS flexibilities studied by our model are of special concern to the pharmaceutical industry. First consider CL. A country's ability to operationalize CL is likely to depend not just on its technological capability, but also on the nature of the product. One would expect that the issuance of a compulsory license is facilitated when the product is protected by a single (or just a few patents), as opposed to a large number of them. In this sense, the pharmaceutical industry is a natural candidate for CL since most patented drugs are typically protected by a single patent, unlike say, the smartphone industry where a single phone can contain literally hundreds of patents.==== Furthermore, imitation in the pharmaceutical industry is remarkably cheap relative to innovation, thereby making patent protection especially valuable for firms. With regard to exhaustion policy, the cost of shipping patented drugs internationally is often fairly miniscule relative to their value so that the incentive for arbitrage-induced parallel imports is strong in this industry. This implies that both the main TRIPS obligation of providing IPR protection as well as its two key flexibilities – CL and exhaustion policy – are especially relevant to the pharmaceutical industry.====Our stylized North-South model involves two parties: the Southern government and a Northern firm that sells a product that is protected by a patent (that lasts for ==== periods) in its local market. The timing of decision making is as follows. In the first period, the South decides whether or not to institute patent protection in its market while the firm chooses its investment in quality-enhancing research and development (R&D) and decides whether or not to incur the fixed cost of entry necessary for selling its product in the South. As in related literature, our model assumes that if the South does not implement patent protection then the firm's technology diffuses locally and a competitive local industry producing an imitated version of the firm's product comes into existence. Due to the limited technological capability of the South, the quality of the imitated product is assumed to be (weakly) lower than that of the original.====Our core model assumes that the North follows national exhaustion and it delivers three main results. First, the South chooses to institute patent protection iff such protection is necessary and sufficient to induce entry by the firm and the quality disadvantage suffered by local imitators is sufficiently large. This finding clarifies how a balancing of the competing welfare effects of its patent policy – on local consumers on the one hand and foreign innovation incentives on the other – can induce a developing country to voluntarily institute patent protection even though it itself lacks the ability to innovate. Our second key finding is that the introduction of patent protection in the South increases the firm's R&D investment as well as its incentive to enter the Southern market. The beneficial effect of Southern patent protection on R&D has consequences for not just the firm but also Northern consumers. The third major result delivered by the core model is that even if the firm is willing to sell in the South in the absence of local patent protection, providing such protection increases global welfare since the South's incentive for patent protection is too weak relative to what is jointly optimal. This last result provides a potential rationale for the strengthening of patent protection in developing countries required under TRIPS. However, we also find that if the firm has no incentive to sell in the South even when it's granted patent protection, then forcing the South to offer such protection lowers global welfare. The intuition here is that if the Southern market does not factor into the firm's global profit then the South's patent policy has no affect on the firm's R&D incentive. Under such a situation, denying Southern consumers access to the imitated product inflicts a welfare loss on them without generating ==== gains for the firm or Northern consumers.====As the above discussion clarifies, an important driver of the welfare consequences of Southern patent protection in our model is its effect on the firm's entry decision. How relevant is this channel empirically? A well-developed empirical literature has demonstrated beyond doubt that this channel is very much operative in the real world. For example, using export data at the 3-digit ISIC level from 1962 to 2000, Ivus (2010) investigates the impact of TRIPS induced IPR reforms in developing countries on the exports of developed countries to their markets and finds that the strengthening of IPR protection undertaken by 18 non-colonies (in her set of 53 developing countries) increased the annual value of developed country exports to their markets in patent-sensitive industries by about $35 million (or about 8.6%). She also shows that the increases in the value of imports was driven largely by changes in quantities as opposed to prices.==== Using data on launches of 642 new drugs in 76 countries during 1983–2002, Cockburn et al. (2016) estimate that, controlling for a variety of economic and demographic factors, starting from the complete lack of patent protection, the introduction of product patents (lasting 18 years) increases the per-period hazard of drug launch in a country by about 55%. This finding is of vital importance since new drugs are launched only in a handful of rich countries and usually become available in other parts of the world with significant delay. For example, in their entire sample of 642 new drugs, 39% were launched in ten or fewer countries and only 41% were launched in more than 25 countries.====We extend the core model to analyze the role of two key TRIPS flexibilities: the South's right to use CL licensing and the North's right to implement the exhaustion policy of its choosing. Consistent with TRIPS rules, our model incorporates CL as follows: given that the South offers patent protection and the firm chooses not to enter in the first period, for the remaining duration (==== − 1 periods) of the patent the South has the authority to issue a compulsory license to a local producer who is required to set price equal to marginal cost. In the event of CL, the South pays a per-period royalty to the Northern firm. This royalty captures the adequate remuneration requirement of Article 31 of TRIPS. The one-period waiting period before CL can be activated by the South captures the TRIPS requirement that a patent-holder must be granted a “reasonable” amount of time to work its patent in a market before the local government can issue a compulsory license.====Our analysis shows that the effects of CL on innovation incentives are more nuanced than previously understood. In our model, making CL available to the South has an adverse effect on the firm's R&D incentive only when the possibility of CL induces the firm to forsake entry in order to collect royalty payments under CL. On the other hand, when the firm has no intention of selling in the South in the absence of CL, making CL available allows the firm to collect royalties from the Southern market that are proportional to the quality of its product and this tends to increase its R&D investment.==== We also identify circumstances where CL is preferable to entry from a joint welfare perspective as well as when it is not. When CL encourages R&D, it welfare dominates entry since it also economizes on the fixed cost of entry. A welfare trade-off between the two modes only arises when CL dampens R&D incentives and delivers a lower quality product to consumers. When such is the case, entry is preferable from a global welfare perspective whenever the fixed cost of entry is low and the technological disadvantage under CL is large.====In Section 4 of the paper, we examine how the firm and consumers in the two region fare if the North were to implement international exhaustion as opposed to national exhaustion. As in related literature, we find that holding constant the South's patent protection policy, the firm is more willing to sell in the South under national exhaustion. Furthermore, the South is better off under national exhaustion due to two separate reasons: first, holding constant the quality of the product across the two exhaustion regimes, price in the South is lower under national exhaustion. Second, the Northern firm invest more in R&D and therefore delivers a higher quality product under national exhaustion. From the North's viewpoint, these two forces work against each other: price is higher under national exhaustion but quality is also higher. All in all, national exhaustion delivers higher joint welfare than international exhaustion provided the firm sells in both markets. This result fits well with the traditional argument that parallel trade reduces innovation incentives by undermining the ability of IPR holders to profit from their R&D investments.====How do Southern incentives for patent protection depend upon North's exhaustion policy? As in the case of national exhaustion, the South chooses to provide patent protection under international exhaustion only when its imitative ability is low and patent protection is necessary to induce entry by the firm although the relevant thresholds are not the same under the two scenarios. Interestingly, the fact that profits from entry are lower under international exhaustion results in an ambiguous relationship between North's exhaustion policy and Southern patent protection. Relative to national exhaustion, both the maximum level of the fixed entry cost below which the South is willing to offer patent protection ==== the minimum level of fixed entry cost above which patent protection is desirable for the South are lower under international exhaustion. As a result, the relationship between North's exhaustion policy and South's incentive for patent protection is generally ambiguous. This ambiguity implies that Northern R&D could be either higher or lower under national exhaustion once the induced effect of the South's patent policy on R&D is taken into account.==== Finally, we examine the interaction between CL in the South and the nature of Northern exhaustion policy and show that not only is CL more likely to arise in equilibrium under international exhaustion, it is also more likely to be socially efficient relative to entry.====This paper makes several novel contributions to the literature.==== First, it brings together two important but separate strands of related literature: the rather well-developed literature exploring the economics of alternative exhaustion policies and the emerging literature on the effects of CL.==== While these two TRIPS flexibilities have been studied separately, there exists no model that analyzes them jointly. Second, we provide a model of CL in which both innovation ==== the South's patent protection policy are endogenous. Although there exist several models of exhaustion that allow for endogenous innovation – such as Valleti (2006) and Grossman and Lai (2008) – these models consider neither CL nor the South's incentive for patent protection. Furthermore, existing models of CL – such as Bond and Saggi, 2014, Bond and Saggi, 2017, Bond and Saggi, 2018 – abstract from innovation and therefore cannot address the effects of CL on innovation incentives.====The model developed in this paper significantly generalizes the analysis of CL developed by Bond and Saggi (2018) in two key dimensions: first, it incorporates endogenous innovation into their model and, second, it sheds light on how the North's exhaustion policy affects the firm's R&D as well as the South's incentive for patent protection. Bond and Saggi (2018) provide a useful starting point for our analysis since, like the model developed here, Southern patent protection policy and the Northern firm's decision to sell in the South are endogenously determined in their model. However, the results reported in the present paper on the linkages between innovation and the two key TRIPS flexibilities are simply beyond the scope of Bond and Saggi (2018) since not only does their model abstract from innovation, it also assumes that the royalty payment under CL is fixed and therefore unresponsive to the quality of the product. While a fixed royalty payment is a reasonable assumption in their model since it does not consider innovation, it nevertheless is limiting in nature since it implies that the return to the firm from licensing its product is unlinked to its economic value – a feature that does not correspond well with existing TRIPS rules on CL.",Patent protection in developing countries and global welfare: WTO obligations versus flexibilities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619301011,6 December 2019,2019,Research Article,199.0

This induces substantial variation in market share elasticities with respect to a given exporter’s trade costs across its competitors, with the largest magnitude elasticities between countries most likely to compete head-to-head in the same products. The model is thus able to generate more nuanced predictions for how bilateral agricultural trade and production patterns shift in response to changes in policy than existing models. I provide a novel methodology to estimate the parameters of the distribution of productivity and trade costs that draws on techniques pioneered in the discrete choice literature. This approach has the considerable advantage of allowing me to parameterize and solve a product-level conceptual model while relying on very little data beyond widely available sector-level data used in a standard gravity model. This framework promises to allow researchers to make more informed predictions for how global agricultural trade and production patterns shift in response to policy change.","A central prediction of economic theory is that opening to trade allows countries to specialize according to comparative advantage. However, simplifying assumptions on the structure of production within sectors in existing quantitative models of trade abstract from the forces that drive intra-sectoral comparative advantage. Empirical models that define technology with “heterogeneous productivity” across products provide the tools to define comparative advantage at the individual product level, but employ strong distributional assumptions on productivity and trade costs to preserve tractability. These assumptions impose stiff restrictions on the elasticity of sector-level market share with respect to trade costs, resulting in rather coarse predictions for how intra-sector patterns of production and trade shift in response to policy changes (Arkolakis et al., 2012).====My point of departure is the probabilistic Ricardian model of Eaton and Kortum (2002), henceforth EK, with two tradable sectors: agriculture and manufacturing. These two sectors are differentiated by average productivity, as well as the forces that shape intra-sector specialization patterns. As in EK, production efficiency is modeled as an independent random variable following a Frechet distribution with a country- and sector-specific mean. However, product-specific agro-ecological suitability provides a second source of productivity differences within the agricultural sector such that countries with similar agro-ecological characteristics systematically have high productivity in similar agricultural products. Like EK, trade occurs as buyers in each import market purchase each product from the source country with the lowest price inclusive of “iceberg” trade costs. Unlike EK, trade costs vary across agricultural products. I estimate parameters describing the distribution of agricultural trade costs and productivity using methods pioneered in the literature on differentiated products demand systems, notably by Berry (1994) and Berry et al. (1995). This allows me to connect the product-level conceptual model to sector-level trade and production data without strong distributional assumptions.====Introducing systematic heterogeneity within the agricultural sector generates correlation in the probability of offering the lowest price, thus generating larger magnitude trade elasticities among countries whose agro-ecological characteristics are suitable for similar agricultural products. I compare the model to one in which both sectors feature the EK technology and calculate general equilibrium trade elasticities implied by each. The model with systematic specialization sensibly predicts that U.S. agricultural market share is disproportionately responsive to changes in Canadian bilateral trade costs in most import markets, whereas changes in Costa Rican bilateral trade costs tend to have a much smaller impact on the U.S. than other competitors. In contrast, the EK model generates almost no variation in market share response across competitors.====Second, I find the median country has measured welfare gains from trade almost three times larger in the model with systematic forces driving specialization in agriculture. The relatively large gains generated by the new model suggest that the single parameter that describes the dispersion of productivity within a sector in the EK model is insufficient to capture the true variation in productivity across agricultural products and countries. Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare (2014), Levchenko and Zhang (2014), and Caliendo and Parro (2015) suggest that models that abstract from heterogeneity across sectors will systematically under-estimate gains from trade. This result demonstrates that may be equally true for heterogeneity ==== sectors. For the case of agriculture, this is supported by Fally and Sayre (2018), who argue that it is particularly important to account for heterogeneity across commodities.====Finally, I use the model with systematic heterogeneity to compare trade liberalization of all agricultural products to partial liberalization that maintains trade barriers on cotton and beef. This experiment demonstrates a significant practical advantage of the model, namely its ability to incorporate a more complex set of changes in product-specific policy. This is particularly useful for agricultural sector analysis where trade-distorting tariffs and farm subsidies vary tremendously and are typically applied at the product-level. The model predicts that the largest losses from partial relative to full liberalization are in countries where 1) cotton or beef represent a large share of agricultural imports; and 2) agro-ecological conditions are not well-suited for their production.====The model retains the basic structure that delivers the log-linear gravity-like relationship in EK, which can also be obtained form other quantitative trade models (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2004). Arkolakis et al. (2012) show that models which feature this relationship also feature the restrictive system of elasticities described above, which they dub a “CES import demand system"". This includes models built on Melitz (2003) or on an Armington assumption.====A logical alternative to introducing systematic heterogeneity within the agricultural sector is to model the economy as comprised of several agricultural subsectors as several authors, including Chor (2010), Costinot et al. (2011), Tombe (2015), Shikher (2012a), Shikher (2012b), Kerr (2017) Levchenko and Zhang (2014) and Caliendo and Parro (2015) have done, primarily for the manufacturing sector. These models allow average productivity, and in some cases productivity dispersion to vary across sectors, generating non-random patterns of specialization across sectors and thus also depart from the stiff substitution patterns implied by the standard gravity model at the sector level.====However, there are both practical and theoretical limitations to this approach. First, these models impose a CES import demand system at the subsector level. Therefore, the researcher must define subsectors comprised of sufficiently “like” products such that specialization within the sector can be assumed randomly determined ====. While it is clear that, e.g. wheat and pineapples likely belong in different subsectors, it is less obvious where the exact boundaries should be drawn. Moreover, large and systematic differences in product-specific policy distort the forces of comparative advantage even among products that are otherwise highly substitutable.====Even assuming the appropriate classification were known, the multiple subsector approach requires a dependent variable calculated from matched bilateral trade and production data for each subsector, whereas the empirical methodology used here only requires this information at the agricultural sector level. This is a significant advantage because reliable data are more difficult to obtain at a finer level of disaggregation. Likewise, a model with multiple subsectors requires corresponding information from input-output matrixes to incorporate sectoral linkages. However, even the most detailed input-output tables typically aggregate agriculture into only a few subectors. Furthermore, many agricultural products are thinly traded. As such, as the sector becomes more disaggregated zero trade flows begin to dominate with some countries having no imports or exports from any source. Finally, the gravity-like structural relationship at the heart of the EK model relies on the assumption that each tradeable sector is comprised of a continuum of products or varieties. The more narrowly defined are the subsectors, the less plausible is this assumption.====The paper is also related to the literature that introduces land heterogeneity into trade models. Costinot and Donaldson, 2012, Costinot and Donaldson, 2016 and Sotelo (2019) incorporate location and product-specific land and climate suitability as a key factor in patterns of specialization in agriculture. Costinot and Donaldson, 2012, Costinot and Donaldson, 2016 use measures of potential yield obtained from agronomic models produced by the Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) project (IIASA/FAO 2012) as measures of product- and location-specific productivity in an EK-style model. These measures capture key elements of agro-ecological suitability, but they are only available for a limited number of products. The approach here uses some of the same land and climate inputs used in the GAEZ agronomic models to econometrically estimate a distribution of land productivity that covers the full agricultural sector. Sotelo (2019) incorporates product and location-specific productivity in a model used to explore the impact of trade and transport shocks on Peruvian agriculture. Although agro-ecological factors implicitly underlie heterogeneity in productivity, a structural relationship between productivity, prices and land allocation is used to parameterize productivity for each of the 20 products that comprise the agricultural sector. Land and climate information is only used indirectly. Fally and Sayre (2018) also introduce heterogeneity in the productivity of natural resources for producing commodities, including agricultural commodities.====A recent paper with a close parallel is Adao et al. (2017). Adao et al likewise weaken the CES demand assumption imposed in standard gravity models by specifying bilateral demand as a random coefficients logit model as in Berry (1994) and Berry et al. (1995). They refer to this as a “mixed CES” demand system. They are likewise motivated by the desire to allow exporters that are “closer” to one another in terms of characteristics to be closer substitutes in international trade. The model in Adao et al is otherwise distinct. Rather than a focus on demand for product imports, they characterize world trade as a system of demand for factor services.====Finally, this paper contributes to the application of structural gravity models to food and agricultural products. Notable contributions include Reimer and Li (2010), Jayasinghe et al. (2010), Cardamone (2011), Xu (2015) and Dal Bianco et al. (2015).====I present the model in the following section. Next, I illustrate implied cross-country trade elasticities. In Section 4 I specify the gravity-like model from which I estimate trade costs and parameters of the productivity distribution. I solve the general equilibrium model in Section 5. In Section 6 the model is compared to an EK-style model with multiple agricultural sub-sectors. In Section 7 I conduct a counterfactual experiment comparing full and partial liberalization.

The services provision accounts for up to 22.4% of the manufacturing exports of bi-exporters (i.e., the firms that export both goods and services), and 11.8% of overall goods exports from Belgium. To rationalize these findings, we propose a model of oligopolistic competition in which, by supplying services with their goods, firms increase their market share, and hence their market power and markup. This is possible because services act as a demand shifter for firms, thus increasing the ==== quality of their products. Our data provides compelling evidence in this direction. We finally also discuss the relevance of other theoretical rationalizations.","Economists and policymakers generally consider goods and services as two distinct sectors subject to their own market adjustments, calling for specific policies. Yet, this is at odds with what we observe for many big firms. Examples include: Apple selling software and assistance with the utilization of its computers and cell phones, Toyota providing both cars and loans to consumers buying these cars, Technip supplying fertilizers as well as technical and financial solutions related to their utilization.====In this paper, we challenge the view that goods and services are two independent items in the consumer portfolio supplied by firms in separate industries. Thanks to a unique dataset recording both goods and services exports at the firm-destination level, we show that the provision of services is associated with higher goods sales. The effect of services provision on manufacturing goods exports is quantitatively important. Based on our regression results, which rely on high-dimensional fixed effects and an IV strategy, it appears that up to 11.8% of overall Belgian manufacturing exports and up to 22.4% of the manufacturing exports of those firms that export both goods and services (called hereafter “bi-exporters”) are triggered by services. The increase in sales is the combination of a price and a quantity effect: when they provide services together with their goods, bi-exporters set a higher price for their goods and still sell higher quantities. Note that this is the price of the good alone: the service is subject to a transaction in its own right in the data; therefore, services act as a demand shifter for the goods. To rationalize the patterns uncovered in the data, we propose a theoretical explanation based on one-way complementarity between goods and services (i.e., the good can be consumed alone or bundled with a service, but the service is never consumed alone), love for variety, and oligopolistic competition. These three ingredients interact such that the provision of services increases the perceived quality of the products with which they come. We finally put our theoretical results in perspective with a series of alternative rationalizations of our empirical findings.====We believe our results have important implications. First, they suggest that the frontier between manufacturing and services is blurred. This should affect the way we think of structural change: the expansion of the service sector is not necessarily at the expense of manufacturing. Second, they question the way we should define the relevant markets for competition policy and the design and negotiation of trade agreements. Specifically, they plead for a unified framework where goods and services are taken into account together (e.g., Lodefalk, 2015; Heuser and Mattoo, 2017). Finally, our mechanism is more general than the goods-services case and can be applied to any firm's output that exhibits the same one-way complementarity. One easy example is represented by the relationship between the iPad and the iPad cover. The identification and analysis of the one-way complementarity between all the possible pairs of products are beyond the scope of this paper, but they represent interesting research avenues that we leave for future work.====The paper is organized into three main parts. In the first one, we use detailed trade data from the National Bank of Belgium (NBB henceforth) to provide several stylized facts on bi-exporters. They represent only 8.8% of exporters and the remaining 91.2% of them are either pure goods exporters (60.1%) or pure services exporters (31.1%). Despite being only few, they outperform pure goods and services exporters in many dimensions and they account for about 44.8% of overall goods exports and 42.3% of services exports. Moreover, bi-exporters almost never export services in destinations in which they do not offer goods, and they export services in only 26.6% of the destinations where they export goods. When present, services represent only a small fraction of the goods export flow. The last two elements reveal an asymmetry in our data in the relationship between goods and services within the same firm. They suggest that for bi-exporters, the goods are the main activity of the firms, while services only sometimes complement goods provision.==== This is corroborated by the observation that in a given market, bi-exporters export more of a given good than “pure” goods exporters, while this is the opposite for services export flows. Based on these facts, we focus in the rest of the paper on firms that export goods and try to understand whether services can be a source of competitiveness for them. When comparing firm-product-destination export flows that are associated with services to those that are not, we find that services provision is correlated with higher manufacturing sales; this premium holds when we control for both firm-product-year and destination-product-year fixed effects, and for a number of other observable characteristics.====In a second step, we seek an unbiased estimate of the effect of services provision on firm-level goods export performance. Indeed, despite the presence of multiple controls and fixed effects, it could still be the case that unobserved firm-country specific factors explain both why firms export services in a given destination and also sell large quantities of their goods. In this respect, any variable that affects the probability that a firm exports services to a given destination, without affecting directly its manufacturing sales to that destination, offers scope for causal inference about the role of services on firm-level manufacturing sales. We thus rely on an IV strategy proposed by Wooldridge (2002) for the case of endogenous dummy variables. Our excluded variable is constructed as the interaction between a “bundleability” index that measures how much the HS6-products in the firm's portfolio can be associated with services, with a proxy for the easiness of trade in services to a given destination. Considering that our excluded variable is a combination of a product-specific characteristic and a proxy for country-specific conditions for services trade, we can reasonably argue that in the presence of firm-product-year and destination-product-year fixed effects, it is not directly correlated with firm-product-destination supply or demand shocks. Using this strategy, we confirm the positive effect of services on goods export performance, and we show that it results from an increase in both prices (unit values) and quantities.====To rationalize these facts, we develop in the third part a model of oligopolistic competition where goods and services are one-way essential complements.==== This means that the service itself does not raise the utility of the consumer unless it is associated with a good. In this way, the product is essential while the service is optional. A firm in our model can be seen as a two-product firm whose core product is the good alone while its peripheral product is a good-service bundle. In the presence of taste for variety, supplying the bundle naturally raises the demand for the good. This translates into a larger market share, and thus higher markups over the marginal cost of production of the good accounting for the price premium of bi-exporters. We also consider direct extensions of standard models of multi-product firms under monopolistic competition or oligopoly with and without cost linkages; we discuss as well the possibility that services are provided locally by affiliates or external suppliers, and the case where goods and services are two-way complements (i.e., both are essential to the consumer). While appealing, most of these different modelling strategies can hardly rationalize some of our empirical findings, in particular the price premium. It is possible however to rationalize our findings under monopolistic competition when the consumption of services enters directly as a demand shifter for the goods: this is the case when services and high-quality varieties are complements and consumers' willingness to pay increases with product quality (Manova and Yu, 2017) or when the breadth of a firm's product range raises the demand for any of its products (the demand-scope complementarities assumption in Bernard et al., 2017a).====In the oligopolistic model we propose, by raising both the demand and the price of the goods, services provision acts as a demand shifter for the goods; or put differently, services increase the perceived quality of the good without entering directly as a demand shifter for it. Our model puts some structure on this intuition by generating a firm-product-destination demand shifter similar to that in Khandelwal et al. (2013): all else equal, the perceived quality of a good should be larger when the good comes with a service. This is indeed what we find in the data: a one standard deviation increase in the probability of providing services increases the firm-product-destination index of perceived quality by 20% of a standard deviation for bi-exporters. Therefore, this paper provides the first econometric evidence that services provision is an important determinant of the appeal of manufacturing products.====Our paper contributes to several strands of the literature. First, with the increasing availability of detailed firm-level data, the theoretical and empirical literature on the sources of firm success has thrived over the past twenty years. Limiting the scope to the international trade literature, two main determinants have been emphasized: productivity (e.g., Bernard and Jensen, 1999; Melitz, 2003) and quality (e.g., Johnson, 2012; Crozet et al., 2012). How these differences then translate into heterogeneous markups has also been discussed in some contributions (e.g., Melitz and Ottaviano, 2008; Loecker and Warzynski, 2012). Hottman et al. (2016) develop a model of multi-product firms that encompasses all these aspects, and structurally estimate the relative contributions of these various determinants of firm performance. They find that appeal/quality of products and product scope account for 80% of the observed variation in overall sales of US firms. In their model, the products supplied by a firm are imperfect substitutes. In our model, productivity, product appeal, and markups are related through the combination of one-way complementarity between goods and services, imperfect substitutability between the good alone and the good provided with the service, and consumers' love for variety. By providing services with their goods, more productive firms increase the demand for their good and can, in turn, increase their markup, which leads to improving the perceived quality of their products.====Second, considering instead an oligopolistic market structure is motivated by the fact that, in our data, bi-exporters are found among the largest Belgian exporters. In this respect, our paper echoes recent empirical and theoretical works that show that the largest firms in the economy significantly deviate from perfectly or monopolistically competitive firms in many dimensions. Exchange rate pass-through (Berman et al., 2012; Amiti et al., 2014), price interactions between firms (Amiti et al., 2019), and adjustment to trade liberalization (Edmond et al., 2015) are some examples where allowing for strategic behavior of firms is important to account for the patterns observed in the data. Several recent contributions plead to go further in this direction (Bernard et al., 2018; Neary, 2016; Head and Spencer, 2017). We contribute to this literature by showing both empirically and theoretically how the range of activities of a firm impacts its market share and pricing behavior.====The literature on multi-product exporters analyzes the choice of firms to provide multiple products (e.g., Eckel and Neary, 2010; Bernard et al., 2011; Dhingra, 2013; Nocke and Yeaple, 2014; Mayer et al., 2014; Hottman et al., 2016). In multi-product firm models under monopolistic competition, it is assumed that the behavior of a firm is isomorphic to the behavior of a set of single-product firms with different productivities; therefore, the firms' decision to add/drop one product in a given market has no impact on its other products. By contrast, models of oligopoly emphasize demand linkages within the firm: when products are imperfect substitutes, adding a product tends to ==== the output of other products. Our model features large firms competing strategically when consumer demand features one-way complementarity between goods and services. This mechanism is also in line with Bernard et al. (2017a) who show that the size of firm-level product scope allows firms to raise their price conditional on the quantity sold. Besides the common broad interest in understanding how the scope of economic activities of a firm relates to its economic performance, there are important differences between our paper and Bernard et al. (2017a). First, they provide a margin decomposition of firm-level exports and study the heterogeneous relationship between each margin and firm-level TFP across what they call “carry along” and regular exports; they also show that export unit values tend to increase with the firm product scope in a destination. Instead, we investigate how the provision of services is related to the firms' manufacturing export values, quantities and prices controlling for a firm's product scope. Second, by embedding a demand system featuring one-way complementarity (Chen and Nalebuff, 2006) in a model of oligopolistic competition, our model generates a price premium for bi-exporters. Thus, it can be seen as one possible micro-foundation for the demand-scope spillover assumption in Bernard et al. (2017a) i.e., a positive relationship between the scope for the items proposed by a firm and the individual demand for these items.==== Third, we show that this premium is empirically equivalent to identifying a quality premium: conditional on price, bi-exporters sell higher quantities of their goods as compared to “pure” goods exporters.====Our paper also relates to the literature on structural transformation and services. Most of the contributions see this phenomenon from a macro perspective in terms of sectoral reallocations driven by final demand (e.g., Buera and Kaboski, 2009; Herrendorf et al., 2013, Herrendorf et al., 2014). Recent papers instead highlight the within-firm dimension of structural transformation: firms progressively give up producing goods to increasingly specialize in services.==== This is the consequence of trade in goods liberalization (Breinlich et al., 2018; Pierce and Schott, 2016), firm specialization (Bernard and Fort, 2015; Bernard et al., 2017b) or offshoring (Berlingieri, 2014). Our paper provides a different perspective by showing that the production and exports of goods and services can be complementary, and that combining the two increases the willingness to pay for goods.====Finally, other recent papers are interested in the interplay between good and services. Using the WIOD database, Miroudot and Cadestin (2017) and Heuser and Mattoo (2017) analyze the role of services in manufacturing global value chains. Consistent with our results, Crozet and Milet (2017a) show that French firms in the manufacturing sector that start selling services increase their profitability and total sales of goods. Using Belgian data on overall sales, Blanchard et al. (2017) show that the probability to provide both goods and services is a non-linear function of firm-level productivity. Since all these studies use balance-sheet data with no information on the destination of the sales, the analysis in terms of mechanisms is limited. Finally, with the same data as ours, Ariu et al. (2019) are interested in understanding the gains from purchasing goods and services from the same origin country as compared to purchasing both items from two different ones; they consequently focus on firms that import both goods and services at some point in time. This approach is motivated by a macro perspective on the quantitative assessment of the gains from trade when both goods and services trade are liberalized together. Instead of analyzing the behavior of firms that import goods and services, we explore the behavior of those that export both. This perspective is crucial to understand what the gains from providing different items that can be consumed together, here goods and services, are as compared to providing only goods. Doing so, we are able to uncover new facts. In particular, our unique dataset allows us to estimate the sales premium of bi-exporters as compared to “pure” goods exporters and spell out the possible mechanisms behind it. To do so, we explore margins that could not be explored in the papers cited above such as unit values; our paper is in the end the first to highlight the nexus between services provision and goods' perceived quality, and to discuss theoretical rationalizations to it.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the data and outline several stylized facts on bi-exporters in Section 2. Based on this evidence, we seek an unbiased estimate of the effect of services provision on the export performance for goods in Section 3. To provide a theoretical basis for our empirical results, we develop in Section 4 an imperfect competition model featuring both consumers' love for variety and one-way complementarity between goods and services. Section 5 discusses alternative explanations for our results, and, finally, Section 6 concludes.",One way to the top: How services boost the demand for goods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300984,21 November 2019,2019,Research Article,201.0

To do so, we match data on Mexican food imports from the U.S. with anthropometric and food expenditure data. Our findings suggest that exposure to food imports from the U.S. can explain up to 20% of the rise in obesity prevalence among Mexican women between 1988 and 2012. Pro-obesity effects are driven by areas more exposed to unhealthy food imports. We also find evidence in favour of a price mechanism. By linking trade flows to obesity, the paper sheds light on an important channel through which globalisation may affect health.","The prevalence of obesity, overweight and other diet-related chronic diseases has increased rapidly in the global south. Today, an estimated 62% of obese individuals live in developing countries (Ng et al., 2014). And the number of overweight or obese people living in the developing world has tripled between 1980 and 2008 (Keats and Wiggins, 2014). Over the same period many emerging economies have opened up their food markets to international competition. In response, policy makers have paid more attention to the implications of globalisation and international trade for population health and diets. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2015), for instance, has adopted a clear mandate to help member states better align trade and health policies. Despite the perceived association between trade liberalisation and diet-related health outcomes (see the review by Barlow et al. (2017b)), the causal effects of trade in foods on obesity and their quantitative importance are not well established.====The rise in obesity observed in emerging economies has been associated with a “nutrition transition” whereby diets become richer in animal fats, sugars, and processed foods as average income increases (Popkin and Gordon-Larsen, 2004). These nutritional changes are intertwined with an epidemiological transition in which populations suffer more from obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases rather than infectious diseases and undernutrition (Omran, 1971).====Greater openness to trade in foods can affect the nutrition transition and hence obesity prevalence through changes in prices, income, norms, and tastes. Lower relative prices of imported and import-competing foods can raise food consumption and the incidence of obesity, especially if such price effects are concentrated in more unhealthy, ‘obesity-prone’ foods. By affecting individuals' income, trade liberalisation can shape the nutrition transition and obesity prevalence. Finally, globalisation and trade openness can induce changes in food tastes and consumption, resulting in persistent and self-reinforcing effects on nutritional outcomes (Atkin, 2013; Dragone and Ziebarth, 2017).====In this paper, we examine the effects of U.S. exports of foods and beverages (F&B or ‘food’ for short) on obesity in Mexico. Over the last decades, Mexico has recorded spectacular increases in diabetes and obesity rates, becoming a prime example of a country in the nutrition transition (Popkin et al., 2012). According to the latest WHO data from 2016, it ranks among the 30 most obese countries in the world, with an estimated 28.9% of the adult population being obese. Trade flows between the U.S. and Mexico have also boomed since the 1980s and in particular following the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994.==== This is especially true for the F&B industry, where U.S. products represent around 75% of total Mexican imports and 8% of Mexican households' food expenditure in 2012 (see Section 4.1 for details). These concurrent trends beg the question: has the U.S. ‘exported’ its high obesity prevalence (the highest among OECD countries (OECD, 2017)) to Mexico through trade in foods?====To identify the effect of U.S. food exports within Mexico, we allocate trade flows across Mexican states – i.e., the lowest spatial unit at which data are representative. We measure each state's ‘exposure’ with its historical expenditure by food product. The general idea is that national trade shocks affect regions and individuals differentially; depending on, for instance, their access to trade routes (Atkin and Donaldson, 2015) and their sectors of employment (Topalova, 2007, Topalova, 2010; Autor et al., 2013; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2017). In our paper, the share of total national expenditure of a given food product in each state at the start of the period measures exposure to trade shocks. In a shift-share design, this pre-determined and time-invariant measure of food consumption is used to predict changes in state-level food imports over time. The empirical approach implies that a Mexican state where expenditure in, say, processed foods, was higher at the beginning of the period will receive a larger share of a given increase in U.S. exports of processed foods. Reassuringly, the ==== changes in state-level food imports from the U.S. correlate strongly with ==== changes in state food imports from the U.S., for which data are available only starting from 2006.====We focus on the import side of food trade between Mexico and the U.S. because of its immediate link with food consumption. While Mexican food exports to the U.S. and elsewhere also increased dramatically (a ten-fold increase in exports to the U.S.), lack of detailed production and employment data by product at the regional level hinders proper identification of their possible influences on obesity. Our analysis nonetheless checks for effects of increased Mexican food exports operating through relative food prices.====We document a positive and robust effect of U.S. food exports on changes in obesity prevalence across Mexican states.==== Our analysis is based on anthropometric data for adult women collected through four surveys in 1988, 1999, 2006 and 2012, as data for men were only collected in later surveys (2006 and 2012).==== The pro-obesity effect is confirmed in both long-difference and stacked first-difference specifications. The relationship between rising exposure to U.S. foods and obesity prevalence is statistically significant, also when controlling for state-level trends in obesity, exposure to foods from other countries (negatively and less strongly associated with obesity changes), and other state-level characteristics.====To bolster a causal interpretation of our findings, we follow Autor et al. (2013) and implement an instrumental variable (IV) strategy that aims at identifying supply-side shifters of U.S. food exports. Changes in U.S. food exports to other destinations than Mexico are used as instrument in order to isolate variation in U.S. food exports stemming from U.S. comparative advantage and market access to third countries across food products. Similar to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates, the IV results point to a sizeable causal effect of exposure to U.S. foods on the rise of obesity prevalence in Mexico. The supply-driven rise in U.S. food exports to Mexico can explain around 10% of the spectacular increase in obesity prevalence among Mexican adult women observed between 1988 and 2012. The findings are confirmed when we use as instrument U.S. food exports to other countries as predicted by the residuals from regressions of U.S. food exports on product and destination fixed effects, which explicitly net out demand-side influences (see also Autor et al. (2013) for a similar strategy).====Counterfactual calculations using IV estimates illustrate that in the absence of food imports from the U.S. between 1988 and 2012, there would have been two millions fewer obese women in Mexico. While suggestive, these numbers point to a quantitatively important impact of food imports on obesity in Mexico, which is comparable to the effects of other changes in the local food environment found in the U.S. (see Courtemanche and Carden (2011) on obesity and Walmart supercenters expansions).====The strong obesity effect of American foods (relative to the lower and downward influence of those from other sources) hints at their unhealthiness, so we further categorize foods using the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA (2010); see also Allcott et al. (2019); and Volpe et al. (2013) for recent applications). While U.S. food exports to Mexico increased ten-fold between 1989 and 2012, exports of unhealthy foods featured the highest increases (e.g., exports of “food preparations” are 23 times higher in 2012 than in 1989). Similar patterns emerge when we group vegetables, fruits, fish and poultry into one category aggregating ‘healthy’ products, and pool other foods and drinks in an ‘unhealthy’ one. In the empirical analysis, this unhealthy component of changes in U.S. food exports drives our baseline findings. Moreover, the obesity effect of trade in unhealthy foods is amplified by low levels of education, potentially widening the already large disparities in obesity risk between women with different levels of education.====We submit our baseline findings to several robustness checks and extensions. In a temporal placebo test, we find that current changes in obesity prevalence are not related to future changes in food imports. Another falsification test using imports of apparel as an alternative measure of states' exposure to trade dismisses spuriousness due to overall trade with the U.S. The findings are also robust to controlling for Mexican food exports, the use of food imports statistics for final demand only, dropping specific states, and employing alternative dependent variables (BMI, overweight).====We explore mechanisms behind our baseline findings guided by standard neoclassical models of obesity (e.g., Philipson and Posner (2003); Cutler et al. (2003); Lakdawalla and Philipson (2009)). In these settings, individuals' utility increases with food consumption and with body weight up to a target weight level above which utility decreases with weight. Holding the ideal weight and the level of physical activity fixed, the reduction in relative food prices and the higher income potentially associated with greater trade integration might (at least initially) increase food consumption and body weight.====Greater import penetration in final goods can lower consumer prices through various theoretical channels – e.g., lower prices of imported goods, pro-competitive pressure on domestic producers, and elimination of policy distortions. As Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016) argue, the quantitative importance of the price-reducing effect of import liberalisation is however less clear and hinges on the specific market conditions. Using Mexican consumer price micro data (1995–2010) from Gagnon (2009) and Gagnon et al. (2013), we test for this mechanism in reduced-form by regressing national food prices on U.S. food exports to other countries – i.e., our instrument for foreign supply shocks. The results point to a negative and significant effect of U.S. export supply shocks on consumer food prices, whose magnitudes are in line with those found in previous studies (Topalova, 2010; De Loecker et al., 2016). While prices of foods (and of other consumer products) went up in Mexico during the sample period (Gagnon, 2009), the evidence suggests that greater exposure to U.S. foods curbed food inflation – an effect that is concentrated in unhealthy food products. Mexican food prices did not respond to U.S. demand-driven shocks to Mexican food exports (as proxied by U.S. food imports from other countries than Mexico), suggesting that the rise of Mexican food exports did not have a significant effect on relative consumer prices. The price effects are strongly confirmed in regressions at the state level – greater exposure to U.S. food supply led to lower food prices, with no effect on local prices of other products.====Greater trade openness could affect food consumption and body weight by changing average income through increased competitiveness and market opportunities. This income channel should however pertain to overall trade rather than food imports only. On the import side, greater import competition can lead to reductions in wages (e.g., Topalova (2010); and Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2017)), which could be partly mitigated by productivity increases through greater access to cheaper inputs (e.g., Kis-Katos and Sparrow (2015)). Our empirical strategy, exploiting differential exposure across food products (and hence within a single industry), is geared towards identification of consumption channels and cannot capture exposure through industry employment, which is normally adopted to identify income effects. In our empirical analysis at the state-level, we find no strong support for a systematic relationship between obesity rates and average income changes, providing little evidence that the obesity-inducing effect of greater penetration of U.S. foods is operating through changes in income.====Increased availability of U.S. foods over time can shift tastes for different types of foods. Consumers' preferences exhibit taste formation when the marginal utility of current consumption increases with past consumption (Dragone and Ziebarth (2017); similar to what Atkin (2013) refers to as “habit” formation). Since higher U.S. food exports are significantly correlated with lower food prices, Mexican households could develop a stronger taste for foods that were relatively cheaper in the past because of exposure to U.S. supply. We test for this channel by regressing household budget shares on lags of U.S. food exports, while controlling for current state-level prices and household characteristics (including real expenditure). Results are overall consistent with habit formation, but the evidence is rather weak.====This paper provides the first causal evidence on trade in foods and obesity. It expands recent conceptual studies (WHO, 2015; Thow, 2009) linking trade liberalisation to the nutrition transition and to the related rise in obesity, diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases in the global south. Existing cross-country studies provide mixed evidence – Miljkovic et al. (2015) and Vogli et al. (2014) report a positive and significant effect of trade openness on obesity and BMI, whereas the findings in Oberlander et al. (2017) and Costa-Font and Mas (2016) suggest that social (rather than economic) globalisation matters. We use detailed data from a single country, Mexico, and contribute to this nascent line of empirical work by identifying the impact of trade in foods (rather than total trade flows).====Our study also complements recent work on the adverse effects of trade liberalisation on health through income and labour market channels (Colantone et al., 2019; Adda and Fawaz, 2017; Pierce and Schott, 2018; Hummels et al., 2016; Lang et al., 2019; McManus and Schaur, 2016). Our paper applies a comparable shift-share identification strategy, but it is the first one to focus on obesity and on a demand-side channel operating through food consumption (Popkin and Gordon-Larsen, 2004; Rivera et al., 2004). In a similar vein, a recent study by Gracner (2015) leverages variation within Mexican states to document that reductions in the price of sugar-rich foods raise the prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of food imports from the U.S. on obesity prevalence in Mexico, and then show empirically that the increasing penetration of U.S. foods has lowered the real price of foods. In line with the price effects of Gracner (2015), we find that the obesity impact of food imports is driven by unhealthy product groups.====More broadly, we add to a large body of work on the economic determinants of obesity and dietary habits (Cawley, 2015). Courtemanche et al. (2016) find that the local economic environment (e.g., retailers and restaurants) explains a significant portion of the observed rise in obesity in the U.S.==== Allcott et al. (2019), however, find that spatial differences in access to healthy foods explain only a small fraction of the differences in nutritional intake across people from different socioeconomic groups (e.g., with different levels of education). In our analysis, we find no evidence of a significant association between changes in obesity prevalence and the local food retail environment, as measured by food expenditure by place of purchase and consumption, and by state penetration of Walmart in Mexico. When controlling for these additional factors, the pro-obesity effect of U.S. foods remains unaltered. Our paper therefore highlights the role of international trade in foods as an independent economic driver of obesity.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe the empirical strategy and the data used in the analysis. Section 4 discusses the results, focusing on a descriptive analysis first (subsection 4.1), and then delving into the econometric results and extensions thereof (subsection 4.2). Section 5 discusses findings and some evidence of mechanisms.

We find a significant reduction in trade cost during this period, and total gains from such improved openness during this period is 7.1%. The gains are decomposed into a Ricardian component and two pro-competitive ones. The pro-competitive effects account for 20% of the total gains. Moreover, the total gains from trade are 13 − 31% larger than what would result from the formula provided by ACR (====), which nests a class of important trade models, but without pro-competitive effects. We find that head-to-head competition is the key reason behind the larger gains, as trade flows do not reflect all of the effects via markups in an event of trade liberalization.","It has been well understood that competition may affect gains from trade via changes in the distribution of markups. For example, when markups are the same across all goods, first-best allocative efficiency is attained because the condition that the price ratio equals the marginal cost ratio, for any pair of goods, holds. In other words, in an economy with variable markups, trade liberalization may improve ==== if the dispersion of markups is reduced.==== Moreover, the ==== also matters because welfare improves with trade liberalization when consumers benefit from lower markups of the goods they consume and when producers gain from higher markups (hence higher profits) in foreign markets. The effects of trade liberalization via changes in both the mean and dispersion of markups are generally termed ====.====A natural question is then whether competition and markups are ==== in gains from trade. To address this, this paper conducts quantitative analyses of the gains from trade using a model that features ==== competition to investigate the role of pro-competitive effects. We use Chinese firm-level data in Economic Censuses in 1995 and 2004 to quantify our model. China in between these two years is an important case, as this was a period when China drastically improved openness – not only was transport infrastructure rapidly expanded, but joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 also drastically reduced trade barriers.==== Recently, Brandt et al. (2017) and Lu and Yu (2015) have both estimated firm-level markups using Chinese manufacturing data and the approach by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012; henceforth DLW). Lu and Yu (2015) show that the larger the tariff reduction due to the WTO entry in one industry, the greater the reduction in the dispersion of markups in that industry. Brandt et al. present similar results on levels of markups. These empirical results suggest that pro-competitive effects might be present in the case of China, but a formal quantitative welfare analysis is warranted.====The two focuses of our welfare analyses are how head-to-head competition matters for the ==== gains from trade and the ==== of these total gains into a standard Ricardian component and pro-competitive effects. To appreciate what we do, it is important to review recent related studies. First, Arkolakis et al. (2012; henceforth ACR) show that for a class of influential trade models, welfare gains from trade (====) can be simply calculated by ====, where ==== is domestic expenditure share, and ϵ < 0 is the trade elasticity. As both ==== and ϵ depend on trade flows, trade flows provide key information regarding gains from trade. However, this class of models features no pro-competitive effects. To investigate pro-competitive effects, Edmond et al. (2015; henceforth EMX) use a model of distinct-product Cournot competition ==== Atkeson and Burstein (2008) and find that pro-competitive effects account for 11 − 38% of total gains from trade. Moreover, even though EMX’s model deviates from the ACR class and sizable pro-competitive effects are found, it turns out their total gains from trade is well captured by the local version of the ACR formula. Similar results are also found by Feenstra and Weinstein (2017). Whereas ACR (p. 116) state, “ While the introduction of these pro-competitive effects, which falls outside the scope of the present paper, would undoubtedly affect the composition of the gains from trade, our formal analysis is a careful reminder that it may not affect their total size”, the present paper will revisit both the ==== and ==== of gains from trade, and show how head-to-head competition matters.====Our quantitative framework is a variant of Bernard et al. (2003; henceforth BEJK). To understand our framework, we first note three features of BEJK. First, the productivity of firms is heterogeneous and follows a Fréchet distribution. Second, firms compete in Bertrand fashion good by good and market by market with active firms charging prices at the second lowest marginal costs. Third, although differences in markups are driven by productivity differences through limit pricing, it turns out that the resulting markup distribution is invariant to trade costs. Holmes et al. (2014) find that this invariance is due to the assumption that the productivity distribution is fat-tailed (Fréchet). If productivity draws are from a non-fat-tailed distribution, then the distribution of markups may change with the trade cost, and pro-competitive effects of trade may be observed.====Figure 1 shows the distribution of markups in China in 1995 and 2004. The distributions are highly skewed to the right, and it is clear that the distribution in 2004 is more condensed than that in 1995. Indeed, the (unweighted) mean markup decreases from 1.43 to 1.37 and almost all percentiles decrease from 1995 to 2004 (See Section 3 for more details). A two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test clearly rejects the null hypothesis that the two samples (1995 and 2004) are drawn from the same distribution.==== Under the BEJK structure, this suggests that one needs to deviate from fat-tailed distributions to account for such changes.====We thus adopt the model of Holmes et al. (2014) with the productivity drawn from log-normal distributions. The log-normal distribution has been widely used in empirical applications; in particular, Head et al. (2014) argue that log-normal distribution offers a better approximation to firm sizes than Pareto. We describe the model in detail in Section 2. In Section 3, we structurally estimate the model using Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) in each data year, as if we are taking snapshots of the Chinese economy in the respective years. Thus, all parameters are allowed to change between these two years to reflect changes in the environment of the Chinese economy. In our main quantitative exercise, we vary only the trade cost. In particular, we gauge the effect of “factual improvement in openness” by examining the effect of changing trade costs from 1995 to 2004. As we focus on competition, our empirical implementation relies heavily on markups. We estimate firm-level markups following DLW and then use moments of markups to discipline model parameters, along with some macro moments.====In Section 4, we conduct welfare analysis on gains from trade. Our benchmark counter-factual analysis is based on 2004 estimates and reverts the trade cost back to the level estimated using 1995 data to gauge the gains from the improved openness in this period. The gain is 7.1% of real income, and the contribution of the pro-competitive effects is 19.9%. The improvement of allocative efficiency accounts for the bulk of pro-competitive effects. The overall gains at 7.1% seems a relatively large number compared with those found in the literature. The sources of the larger gains compared with the literature can be understood as three-fold. First, there is a large reduction in trade cost (from an iceberg cost of 2.31 to 1.78) that is essentially inferred by the large increase in trade flows during 1995–2004. For a given trade elasticity ϵ, this implies large gains by the ACR formula, as ==== and ==== here is small.====Second, Simonovska and Waugh (2014) and Melitz and Redding (2015) argue that new trade models with micro mechanisms such as firm heterogeneity, selection, variable markup, etc, imply lower estimates of absolute value of trade elasticity |ϵ|. By accounting for markup dispersion in the data, our quantification also entails smaller |ϵ|,==== which hovers around 3. As the trade elasticity is a variable in our model, we calculate the gains by the ACR formula by integrating the local formula, and we obtain 5.9%. The gains by the ACR formula would be 3.3% with a standard estimate of |ϵ| = 5.==== Thus, the difference in trade elasticity is the second source of the larger gains.====The total gains from trade in our model are 20%(=7.1/5.9 − 1) larger than the ACR formula, and we investigate the reasoning behind this third source of larger gains. We prove that the extra gains come precisely from the pro-competitive effects in the special case of Cobb-Douglas preference. Under general CES preference, pro-competitive effects may be smaller or larger than the extra gains, but they are still quite close. The intuition is that trade flows do not fully reflect changes in markups in this model with head-to-head competition among firms. For example, a domestic firm may charge a lower price in the face of fiercer foreign competition, but precisely because of the lower price, foreign competitors do not enter, and no trade flows are generated due to this change in markup (See Salvo (2010) and Schmitz (2005) for empirical examples). In contrast, in either monopolistic competition models (such as Arkolakis et al. (2019), Feenstra et al., 2017 and many others)==== or distinct-product Bertrand or Cournot competition models (such as EMX), each firm owns a variety and hence a demand curve along which pricing is determined. A change in trade cost shifts firms’ demand curves through general equilibrium effects or strategic interactions and thus affects markups and trade flows simultaneously. This is not the case here with head-to-head competition.====In Section 5, we extend the model to a multi-sector economy to account for heterogeneity across sectors. The welfare results in the multi-sector economy remain similar to the one-sector economy. Exploiting the variations in sectoral markups and trade costs, we also attempt to answer the question of whether China liberalized the “ right” sectors in terms of reduction in trade cost or tariffs. The rationale is that the overall allocative efficiency would be better improved if the government were to target its trade liberalization more in the higher-markup sectors because this would reduce the dispersion of markups across sectors. We find that when a sectoral markup was higher in 1995, there was a tendency for a larger reduction in the estimated trade cost or import tariff between 1995 and 2004.====A desirable feature of our oligopolistic framework for quantitative analyses with micro-level data is that it is applicable to ====. To illustrate this point, take the closely related work by EMX, which has a sensible feature that links markups with firms’ market shares. Their model is quantified using Taiwanese firm-level data, which works well for their oligopoly environment because they can go down to a very fine product level to look at a few firms to examine their market shares. However, it could be difficult to apply their framework to a large economy (such as the US or China) where even in the finest level of industry or product, there could be hundreds of firms, to the effect that firms’ market shares are typically much smaller than those for a small country. The problem here is that when firms’ market shares are “ diluted” by country size for a given industry or product category, so are pro-competitive effects. This is not to say that pro-competitive effects do not exist in large countries; rather, it may be that there are actually several markets in an industry or product category, but we simply do not know how to separate them. In contrast, markups in our model are driven by the difference between the active firms and their latent competitors, and thus they are not tied to any given product or industrial classification. Our approach is therefore applicable to data from countries of any size.====Besides the above-mentioned studies, earlier theoretical work on how trade may affect welfare through markups include Markusen (1981), Devereux and Lee (2001), and Epifani and Gancia (2011). In particular, Markusen (1981) shows that in an environment with ==== and symmetric countries, trade can reduce markup dispersion and thus enhance welfare without generating trade flows. Our work differs in that we provide quantitative analyses with a richer markup-generating mechanism and by linking to the ACR formula. Whereas our model follows that in Holmes et al. (2014), our work differs in at least three aspects: (1) we quantify pro-competitive effects with Chinese data; (2) we provide theoretical and quantitative analyses on the link to the ACR formula and show that head-to-head competition adds extra gains; (3) we use multi-sector analysis to show how cross-sector markup dispersion matters.====In a monopolistic-competition framework, Arkolakis et al. (2019) study a class of models that allow general preferences and variable markups, and find that the total welfare gains in these models are slightly lower than those with constant markups. In this sense, they conclude that the pro-competitive effects of trade are elusive. Nevertheless, this approach of comparing across models is a different exercise from our welfare decomposition within the same model and from our comparison with the ACR formula. Hence, their exercises are not directly comparable with ours.====Our work is closely related to recent studies regarding how gains from trade are related to the ACR formula. By using both data on trade flows and micro-level prices, Simonovska and Waugh (2014) show that welfare gains from trade in new models with micro-level margins exceed those in frameworks without these margins. Interestingly, even though our trade elasticity is a variable, our local trade elasticities at the estimated models are quite close to their estimates of trade elasticity under the BEJK model. Our work differs by incorporating pro-competitive effects and showing that the total gains from trade can deviate from the ACR formula in the BEJK framework once the productivity draws deviate from Fréchet. Melitz and Redding (2015) show that the trade elasticity becomes variable when the distribution of productivity deviates from untruncated Pareto in the Melitz (2003) framework, and hence the global ACR formula does not apply. Obviously, their mechanism is different from ours.====Our work is also related to de Blas and Russ (2015) and De Loecker et al. (2016), who provide analyses of how trade affects the distribution of markup. But these papers do not address welfare gains from trade. By looking at allocative efficiency, our paper is also broadly related to the literature of resource misallocation, including Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009). Recently, Asturias et al. (2017) has studied the welfare effect of transportation infrastructure in India and examined the role of allocative efficiency in a similar fashion to Holmes et al. (2014) and the current paper.","Competition, markups, and gains from trade: A quantitative analysis of China between 1995 and 2004",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300881,4 November 2019,2019,Research Article,203.0

Casual observation suggests inflation co-moves globally: a feature of the data that has been extensively statistically verified (e.g., see Ciccarelli and Mojon, 2010; Mumtaz and Surico, 2012). The stylized fact that inflation co-moves globally has led to interest in quantifying the role of global determinants of inflation (e.g., see Borio and Filardo, 2007; Neely and Rapach, 2011; Bianchi and Civelli, 2015; Auer et al., 2019) and examining the implications for monetary policy (Carney, 2015).====Our paper contributes to the debate on the role of global factors in driving inflation. Specifically, the main contribution of our paper is to develop a unified framework to study the role of foreign shocks in driving the permanent and transitory components of inflation, which we interpret as trend inflation and the inflation gap respectively. To answer whether global factors have monetary policy implications, we view distinguishing between trend inflation and the inflation gap as key. For example, Draghi (2015) states ====. We interpret this statement as typical central banking doctrine that one should “look through” transitory or one-off changes in prices. Correspondingly, the degree of importance one should attach to the foreign determinants of domestic inflation from a policy perspective depends on how much foreign shocks feed into the trend, or the permanent component of, inflation. If the influence of foreign shocks is shown to be one-off or transitory, then the standard doctrine would be to “look through” or not respond to them. Our paper tackles this issue head-on by developing a model which quantifies the role of foreign shocks in the determination of trend inflation and the inflation gap.====We apply our model to a sample of 28 countries; 7 developed economies and 21 emerging market economies. We highlight three main findings. First, a key result of our empirical exercise is that while they can have a sizeable influence on the inflation gap, foreign shocks play a smaller role in driving trend inflation. This result is consistent with the idea that inflation in the long-run appears to be a monetary phenomenon largely determined by domestic monetary policy, despite foreign shocks driving its short to medium run fluctuations. Second, we find that commodity price shocks account for a large share of the identified role of foreign shocks in driving inflation gap. Third, we find that foreign shocks have a larger impact on trend inflation in emerging market economies relative to developed economies. In fact, in our sample of developed economies, we sometimes find foreign shocks have a negligible to no role in determining trend inflation. We also uncover evidence that these differences in how foreign shocks affect emerging market and developed economies respectively may not just be due to emerging market economies experiencing larger shocks. In other words, it appears that there is some evidence that there are propagation mechanisms at work in emerging market relative to developed economies which accentuate the role of foreign shocks in driving trend inflation in the former group.====Our empirical model can, at a broad level, be viewed as a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression (FAVAR). Using the FAVAR model, we construct trend inflation and the inflation gap consistent with the Beveridge and Nelson (1981)(BN) decomposition. By utilizing the BN decomposition, we adopt a similar concept of trend inflation and the inflation gap which is consistent with the wider trend inflation literature (see, e.g. Stock and Watson, 2007). Taking guidance from the well-established Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) literature, the small open economy structure we adopt provides a straightforward identification of foreign and domestic shocks. Our empirical strategy then consists of decomposing trend inflation and the inflation gap into the identified foreign and domestic shocks, thus providing an account of the role of foreign and domestic shocks in driving both trend inflation and the inflation gap.====While Unobserved Components (UC) models have featured prominently in trend inflation literature (e.g., see Stock and Watson, 2007; Mertens, 2016; Chan et al., 2018), we make a deliberate deviation from the UC literature in one important dimension; by allowing for multivariate information through the FAVAR framework. Our choice allows us to draw on the SVAR literature to identify foreign shocks, and thus tease out causality within our framework. Even so, we stress that the concept of trend inflation is identical to the UC framework, providing a natural link to this body of work. Our work is also related to the literature on the foreign determinants of inflation. In particular, much of the work on the globalization of inflation has looked at the influence of foreign ==== domestic slack in driving inflation (e.g. Borio and Filardo, 2007; Ihrig et al., 2010; Martínez-García and Wynne, 2013; Kabukçuoğlu and Martínez-García, 2018). Indeed, we concur, similar to others (e.g Milani, 2010; Eickmeier and Pijnenburg, 2013), that a regression against a foreign slack measure, such as a foreign output gap, is not sufficiently rich to tell apart the effect of domestic shocks from that of foreign shocks. If an economy is sufficiently open, then foreign shocks drive ==== the foreign and domestic slack, which means one cannot tell the influence of foreign shocks without a formal identification exercise, which is why we view our identification exercise as crucial. In this regard, we take a much broader perspective relative to the extant work of foreign determinants of inflation, which largely focus attention to only a measure of foreign slack.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a description and justification of our empirical methodology. In Section 3, we present the results. In particular, we use our decomposition to understand the role of foreign shocks in driving trend inflation and the inflation gap. We then offer some concluding remarks.",Global factors and trend inflation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219961930087X,31 October 2019,2019,Research Article,204.0

In this paper, we argue that the bargaining power of MNEs is an important factor in explaining these differences beyond profit shifting. First, larger and more profitable firms are more valuable for ==== authorities through, e.g., higher tax revenues and employment. In threatening to move their operations to other jurisdictions, larger firms, and specifically MNEs, may be able to extract greater tax deductions. This results in a regressive ETR schedule for MNEs and NEs. Second, MNEs face arguably lower costs to relocate their business (or profits) to foreign countries with a lower tax rate than NEs. This improves MNEs' threat point in bargaining and enables them further to extract higher tax deductions than NEs. To empirically quantify the importance of bargaining on the tax gap between MNEs and NEs, it is elemental to rigorously condition on the determinants of MNE status, profit taxation, as well as possible profit-shifting activities. To that end, we use French firm-level data and entropy balancing on the joint determinants of MNE status (including the possibility of profit shifting) and a firm's ETR. We find that the empirical regressivity of the French tax schedule reduces French MNEs' ETRs by 2.52 percentage points on average due to their larger size, while the relocation threat of the same firms reduces their ETR by 3.58 percentage points relative to comparable NEs. The former is a tax advantage that any firm (MNE or NE) of the same size could obtain, while the latter is specific to MNEs and beyond the reach of NEs.","Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are an integral part of the world economy. They actively engage in innovation, investment, and trade, provide valuable employment, and generate extensive profits. This is why many countries run campaigns to lure them into their jurisdictions. However, in the public mind and debate, MNEs are frequently accused of avoiding, if not evading, taxation, thus reducing the tax base of their host countries. Individual governments and international organizations – in particular the OECD through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative – have recently begun to try and limit the undesirable tax avoidance and evasion strategies of firms, primarily of MNEs. These internationally coordinated efforts mainly aim at profit shifting activities of MNEs related to transfer pricing, debt shifting, and royalty payments.====The reduction of MNEs' tax bills via profit shifting channels is well documented. However, this paper focuses on a less explored channel: bargaining. In nearly every European country and around the world, firms are able to bargain with local governments or tax authorities over possible deductions in order to reduce their tax bill. In this bargaining game, MNEs are favored to firms that only operate domestically, leading to relatively higher tax savings for MNEs. This directly undermines the efforts of international organizations, such as the OECD and the EU, to limit tax avoidance. Specifically, we think of the bargaining-related tax gap between MNEs and national enterprises (NEs) as a composite of three ingredients: one non-discriminatory element available to all firms and two discriminatory elements only available to MNEs. The two discriminatory elements relate to MNEs' operations of ==== affiliates: (i) foreign affiliates enable profit shifting to low-tax countries (tax avoidance and evasion); and (ii) MNEs are more credibly footloose than NEs which adds to their relative bargaining power at any given firm size and profitability. The non-discriminatory element flows from the empirical regressivity of tax schedules due to the greater bargaining power of larger and more profitable firms as such and leads to increased tax savings for MNEs (see Rego, 2003; Slemrod, 2004), solely rooted in their, on average, larger size and greater profitability relative to NEs (see Markusen, 2002; Helpman et al., 2004). These discriminatory and non-discriminatory elements have not been rigorously disentangled in earlier work on the tax gap between MNEs and NEs, which instead largely focused on analyzing and quantifying profit shifting. The goal of the present paper is to fill this gap and, by focusing on the bargaining-related aspects of tax savings, disentangle and quantify the discriminatory and non-discriminatory bargaining-related tax savings of MNEs using French firm-level data.====Fig. 1 documents the differences in the average effective tax rate (ETR), computed as the ratio of annual corporate profit taxes paid over annual before-tax profits between 2007 and 2012 from unconsolidated accounts, for three distinct firm types in France as recorded in Bureau van Dijk's ORBIS data set: MNEs, multi-entity NEs, and single-entity NEs, where an entity is an independent unit of operation. The figure suggests that MNEs face systematically lower ETRs than both types of NEs on average and that the average ETRs of multi-entity NEs were somewhat lower than those of single-entity NEs. Specifically, the ETR of MNEs is on average 3.42 percentage points lower than that of multi-entity NEs (with a standard error of 0.30).====We argue that the tax gap between MNEs and NEs does not only root in tax avoidance through profit shifting or (illegal) tax evasion, but also in the difference in the bargaining power between MNEs and NEs.==== In this vein, Rego (2003) and Slemrod (2004) provide evidence that tax savings are positively correlated with firms' pre-tax profits, suggesting that the effective tax rate, ETR, declines with pre-tax profits, i.e., the ETR schedule of firms is regressive. Egger et al. (2010) show that MNEs have significant tax savings relative to comparable NEs even for a given pre-tax profit level. Consistent with these empirical findings we develop a stylized theoretical model in Section 3 that will guide our later estimation. Specifically, the model suggests that firms with higher pre-tax profits are in a better bargaining position and, hence, the empirically observable ETR schedule is regressive. In conjunction with the well-established fact of a greater profitability of MNEs relative to NEs, we are able to identify the non-discriminatory element, which we refer to as the ==== on the tax gap between MNEs and NEs. The discriminatory element, the ==== of MNEs relative to NEs, arises from (everything else equal) lower fixed costs to relocate entities (and/or their profits) into countries with lower tax rates.====The aforementioned decomposition requires comparing MNEs to virtually identical NEs over an array of joint determinants of MNE status and profits. Doing so is potentially beyond the reach of linear regression and even of unconstrained, nonparametric econometric models, such as simple propensity score matching. This is because such unconstrained models do not ensure that the tax gap is computed from sets of treated (MNE) and control (NE) firms whose characteristics are ==== identically. To overcome this problem and ensure comparability, we apply entropy balancing, as suggested by Hainmueller (2012) and Hainmueller and Xu (2013), that permits an estimation of the causal effects of MNE status on ETRs through bargaining, conditional on profit-shifting-related tax avoidance and other attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been previously applied in the context of self-selection into MNE status. The present paper employs this framework since the array of determinants of MNE status and firms' (including MNEs') tax payments are largely overlapping, if not the same, and observable. Further, we can show that the distributions of the respective observables vary widely between MNEs and NEs so that conditioning on a compact function of these characteristics (e.g., a linear index or a nonlinear index such as the propensity score of MNE status) does not sufficiently balance these moments as would be required to ensure identification of the average (causal) treatment effect of MNE status on profit tax payments in such frameworks (see Section C of the online appendix to this paper).====France, despite its recent crackdowns and raids on MNEs suspected of avoiding and evading taxes (most recently on the tax structures of Amazon, Apple, Google, and other well-known MNEs, see Brinded, 2013) and notwithstanding its reputation for difficult tax negotiations, is a prime location for such an analysis. France's tax system is based on two codes, the general tax code (Code Général des Impôts) and the tax procedure code (Livre des procédures fiscales), and taxes corporate profits under the territoriality principle. The corporate tax code does not provide for tax holidays. However, it explicitly provides for a host of tax deductions, such as the deduction of losses in foreign subsidiaries (starting from January 1, 2009), of 95% of dividends received from subsidiaries, or of research and development expenditures. Additionally, the corporate tax code allows for tax relief for domestic mergers and international mergers upon approval. France applies controlled foreign company legislation rules, anti-avoidance provisions, tax consolidation regimes, and regulations on payments made to subsidiaries in tax havens.====Akin to the majority of European countries and the United States, the French tax authorities offer advance tax rulings, essentially allowing firms to negotiate their tax deductions before the first Euro is earned (see Van de Van de Velde, 2015 and Waerzeggers and Hillier, 2016, for an extensive overview of tax rulings within Europe).==== Huesecken and Overesch (2019) provide some evidence that these advance rulings lead to significantly lower tax payments. While few of these rulings enter the public awareness, there are several suspected cases of advance rulings that were discussed more widely (e.g., Amazon opened distribution centers in France, adding valuable jobs to the economy and revenue to state coffers after prolonged negotiations with the government, see Le Monde, 2012; Google opened its Paris office after a big push by the Sarkozy government, see Le Monde, 2010), with a handful of disclosed cases (e.g., Vivendi Universal SA, a mass media conglomerate headquartered in France, was permitted to offset the profits from its semi-owned subsidiaries with losses incurred in 2002, significantly reducing Vivendi's tax bill, see ITRWeek, 2004). These tax rulings are binding for the tax authorities, becoming law and being subsequently available to all firms in the same, often quite narrowly defined, situations. However, they are not binding for firms, who can elect to alter their ex-post tax optimization strategies. Given the size of the firms in question, we abstract from illegal tax evasion as the reputational losses and the massive increase in public, private, and governmental scrutiny make this option rather unattractive. Moreover, these firms can afford to design their tax structures in a way that remains within the legal space.====While the number of tax audits remained largely constant in France between 2007 and 2012, coincidentally a time span which coincides with the Sarkozy presidency, the number of penalties imposed dropped at the beginning of the period and only increased after the beginning of the Hollande presidency (see Direction Générale des Finances Publiques, 2016a), after the passage of the Anti-tax Fraud Act in December, 2013, which expanded the investigative powers of the French tax authorities and increased penalties (see Direction de l'Information Légale et Administrative, 2013). In the last few decades, the French state's investment strategy in the private sector has been to opt for non-voting shares in private firms over voting stocks (see Clift, 2012).==== This suggests that French tax authorities are (at least indirectly) linked to French politics, a fact that might be viewed as an important ingredient in the making of French industrial policy.====The actual and possible connections and interactions between MNEs and tax authorities imply that the tax bargaining can be considered a government-assisted form of tax avoidance, among the many other forms of tax avoidance. In fact, France has been investigated and sued by the European Commission for providing French firms (e.g., France Telecom and the operators of France's ==== and the Port of Paris) with illegal state aid in the form of tax exemptions, see Cullen (2006) and European Commission (2016). However, it must be noted that the other, more conventional, forms of tax avoidance generally flow through profit shifting, widening the gap between realized and declared profits, while tax bargaining leads to a reduction of the tax rate on declared profits.==== The results presented below indicate that, on average and after conventional profit shifting, French MNEs earn €1.65 million more in pre-tax profits than comparable NEs on average. Due to the effectively regressive French corporate tax schedule, this translates into a merely size-related average reduction of an MNE's ETR by 2.52 percentage points relative to a comparable NE.==== The direct, bargaining-related effect of being an MNE on the ETR due to MNEs' greater mobility, controlling for pre-tax profits, amounts to a 3.58 percentage-point reduction of the ETR on average. Thus, on average, MNE status reduces the ETR by 6.1 percentage points, conditional on (i.e., after) profit shifting. This effect is mainly driven by firms in the highest quintile of the pre-tax profit distribution.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section 3 outlines a stylized model of bargaining over a representative firm's tax deductions. Section 4 describes the data and the estimation strategy and presents the empirical results.

Specifically, we study the behavior of the bilateral real exchange rate (RER) of Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom with the United States for the period 1960–2014. A rough summary of the results is that shocks that move just four primary commodity prices (PCP) can account for between one-third and one-half of the volatility of the RER between the United States and those three countries.====The relevance of these results is highlighted by the so-called ====: the fact that real exchange rates across developed economies are very volatile, very persistent, and very hard to relate to fundamentals.==== This difficulty opened the door for theoretical explorations of models with nominal rigidities as the source of RER movements, as in, for example, Chari et al. (2002). We will ignore nominal rigidities in our analysis and explore how far one can go with shocks that affect the relative prices of the main primary commodities.====The disconnect puzzle is not present in small open economies in which exports of a few primary commodities are a sizable share of total exports.==== For countries such as Australia, Chile, and Norway, changes in the international prices of the commodities each country exports are highly correlated with their real exchange rates. As we show, a very similar idea can go a long way toward explaining movements in the RER among developed economies.====The idea that we exploit in the paper is very simple: fluctuations in the prices of commodities affect manufacturing costs and, thus, manufacturing prices, which in turn induce changes in the costs of final goods. These cost fluctuations translate into price fluctuations at the country level. If changes in commodity prices have differential effects on the domestic costs of any two countries, primary commodity price changes will affect the real exchange rate between those two countries.====We must make a caveat explicit at this point. In the small open economy literature, it has been customary to assume that the movements in PCP are exogenous to the country. This assumption is reasonable for small countries and simplifies the analysis considerably. When dealing with large economies, such as the ones we analyze in this paper, PCP and RERs are determined endogenously as functions of the state of the economy. This approach complicates the analysis somewhat, but, we argue, the problem is still solvable. We address this issue in two different ways.====We first consider a very simple model in which the exogenous driving forces are productivity shocks and shocks to the supply of commodities. We calibrate the production functions so that the shares of commodities value added in the model are as low as they are in the data, and we calibrate the shocks to the supply of primary commodities so as to match the volatility and persistence of the PCP in the data. We then show that the model can go a long way toward reproducing the volatility and persistence of the RER. We also show that, as we make the shares of commodities in the production function very small, the volatility and persistence of the RER drop dramatically.====We then use the model as an example of how the coefficient of determination in log-linear regressions can be informative regarding the common shocks that move both PCP and RER, even if those shocks are unobservable. In the model, we take a stand on what these shocks are. In the empirical exploration, we are agnostic with respect to which are the underlying shocks and we treat them as unobservable.====Relating PCP changes to RER changes is a promising avenue to explore for several reasons. First, PCP are highly volatile (even more volatile than real exchange rates, as we show below) and very persistent, a feature that, as we mentioned, real exchange rates also exhibit. Second, the share of trade in primary commodities in total world trade is far from trivial: total trade in a few commodities (10) accounts for between 12% to 18% of total world trade in goods, depending on the year chosen.==== This number clearly underestimates the true share of commodities, since trade shares are not value-added measures. Thus, when steel is exported, it is fully counted as a manufactured good, even though an important component of its cost depends on iron. The same happens when a car is exported. Third, primary commodities are at the bottom of the production chain, so they directly affect final goods prices.==== In addition, they may directly affect the prices of other domestic inputs—such as some types of labor and services in general—that are used jointly with primary commodities in the production of intermediate goods, and thus they may indirectly affect the costs of final goods. Because just a few commodities make up a high share of total trade, we need to focus on only a handful of prices. Finally, it is well known that the law of one price on those primary commodities holds, so no ambiguity with respect to their tradability exists. The literature on RER has struggled to separate the set of final goods into two categories: the ones that are traded, for which the law of one price is assumed to hold, and the ones that are not. We only need to assume that for the few commodities we analyze, the law of one price holds, and it is precisely for these prices that independent evidence that the law of one price holds is the strongest.====The exchange rate disconnect puzzle has been widely studied in the literature. Two recent attempts at quantitatively explaining several facts related to the puzzle are Itskhoki and Mukhin (2017) and Eaton et al. (2016). They provide very good descriptions of the state of the literature. The connection between RER and PCP has recently been ignored for the countries we focus on, and not only on the empirical side.==== Ever since the seminal contribution of Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995), the theoretical literature developed to study RER between the countries we consider in this paper has focused exclusively on the production and trade of final goods.==== This tradition eventually was also followed even when studying small open economies, following Galí and Monacelli (2005).====That direction taken by the literature is in contrast with earlier analysis of real exchange determinants. Côté (1987) provides a discussion of a mechanism by which real exchange rates and primary commodity prices jointly respond to shocks; that mechanism is very close to the workings of the model we describe in Section 2. On the empirical side, Sachs (1985) and Dornbusch, 1985a, Dornbusch, 1985b, Dornbusch, 1987) are important contributions. These early attempts, however, have heretofore been ignored in the literature. Our evidence supports the insights of that early literature and suggests that theoretical models of RER among developed economies that ignore primary commodity markets may fall short of providing a comprehensive explanation of RER movements.====In Section 2, we describe the model and derive an equilibrium relationship between RER and PCP. We highlight the fact that in equilibrium, both are jointly determined, so there is no sense in which one can cause the other. In Section 3, using the model as an example, we describe how the ==== of a regression can help us to identify the fraction of the volatility of the RER that can be accounted for by shocks that also move PCP. In Section 4, we describe the data and show some of its moments, and in Section 5, we present the empirical results. The calibration and simulation of the model are presented in Section 6, and Section 7 concludes.",Real exchange rates and primary commodity prices,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300820,24 October 2019,2019,Research Article,206.0

We allow for a general family of political-economic country welfare functions and assess efficiency relative to these welfare functions. We establish a sense in which the resulting tariffs are inefficient and too low, so that excessive liberalization occurs from the perspective of the three countries.","Tariff negotiations between two countries can generate mutual gains by eliminating the inefficient terms-of-trade driven reductions in trade volume that occur under non-cooperative tariff setting. The effects of a bilateral trade deal, however, are not limited to the negotiating countries. Bilateral tariff cuts may also affect the welfare of other countries by altering their terms of trade. Due to this third-party externality, a tariff negotiation that is bilaterally efficient for the negotiating countries may fail to be efficient relative to the preferences of all countries. Furthermore, the outcome of any one bilateral trade negotiation naturally may be impacted by the anticipated outcomes in other contemporaneous bilateral negotiations.====In this paper, we provide an equilibrium analysis of the efficiency properties of simultaneous bilateral tariff negotiations in a three-country model of international trade. Specifically, the trade model entails a home country and two foreign countries, where the home country trades with both foreign countries but the foreign countries do not trade with one another. To analyze simultaneous bilateral tariff negotiations in this context, two basic questions must be answered. First, what, if any, rules are imposed on the negotiated bilateral tariffs? Second, what is the equilibrium concept that governs the manner in which simultaneous bilateral tariff agreements are negotiated?====Negotiation rules could take many forms, and the implications of different rules for trade-bargaining outcomes is an important subject. Our focus here, however, is different. Rather than study the potential implications of different rules, we seek to provide an equilibrium analysis of the “no-rules” benchmark case in which discriminatory tariffs of any non-prohibitive value are allowed. Thus, in our analysis, the home country is free to negotiate bilateral agreements under which it applies discriminatory tariffs to imports from its two foreign trading partners.====We may motivate consideration of the no-rules setting in two ways. First, tariff discrimination is an important possibility worthy of study in its own right, as it is a feature of various important historical trading relationships and arises to varying degrees in the current era as well among GATT/WTO member countries.==== Second, by offering an equilibrium analysis of the non-rules setting, we provide a valuable benchmark for future work that may extend the equilibrium analysis developed here to include rules such as the most-favored nation (MFN) rule.====We turn now to the equilibrium concept. A basic feature of the no-rules setting is that the negotiated tariffs in any one bilateral relationship may affect world prices and thus the payoffs (i.e., welfare levels) that are associated with negotiated tariffs in the other bilateral relationship. The bilateral negotiations are then fundamentally interdependent. We thus require an equilibrium model of simultaneous bilateral tariff negotiations when payoffs and hence negotiation outcomes are interdependent. Our approach here is to adopt the equilibrium solution concept of Horn and Wolinsky (1988).====Originally developed to examine incentives for horizontal mergers in the presence of exclusive vertical relationships, the Horn–Wolinsky solution is now frequently used in the Industrial Organization literature to consider surplus division in bilateral oligopoly settings where externalities exist across firms and agreements.==== The Horn–Wolinsky solution is sometimes referred to as a “Nash-in-Nash” solution, since it can be thought of as a Nash equilibrium between separate bilateral Nash bargaining problems. In the Horn–Wolinsky solution, any given bilateral negotiation results in the Nash bargaining solution taking as given the outcomes of the other negotiations.==== To our knowledge, we are the first to explore the theoretical implications of the Nash-in-Nash approach for simultaneous bilateral tariff negotiations.====The Nash-in-Nash approach offers two main benefits. First, using this approach, we can capture in an equilibrium framework some intuitive strategic features of simultaneous bilateral negotiations with interdependent payoffs. We note in particular that, under the Nash-in-Nash approach, each negotiating pair fails to internalize the consequences of its bargaining outcome for the other negotiating pair. Second, the Nash-in-Nash approach offers a tractable means of characterizing bargaining outcomes when bilateral negotiations are simultaneous and payoffs are interdependent. Correspondingly, and as emphasized in the Industrial Organization literature, an important advantage of the Horn–Wolinsky solution is that it provides a tractable foundation for quantitative analyses in a wide range of applications where negotiations are interdependent.====At the same time, a limitation of the Nash-in-Nash approach is that it does not require that the solution be immune to multilateral deviations. The Nash-in-Nash approach is most directly interpreted in terms of a “delegated agent” model where a player (e.g., a firm in a merger analysis, or a country in a tariff negotiation) may be involved in multiple bilateral negotiations while relying on separate agents for each negotiation, where agents are unable to communicate with one another during the negotiation process. This interpretation may be strained in many settings of interest, including tariff negotiations, where within-negotiation communication between agents associated with the same player may be feasible.==== The interpretation is arguably less strained, however, in settings with bargaining frictions such that opportunities for communication and coordination arise only after bilateral bargaining positions have hardened.====On balance, we believe that the advantages of the Horn–Wolinsky solution make it a potentially valuable tool, albeit only one such tool, for exploring the efficiency properties of bilateral tariff negotiations in various settings. Focusing on the no-rules setting, our paper provides a theoretical foundation for such explorations.====In the context of the three-country tariff negotiation considered here, the Nash-in-Nash approach is captured with a representation in which the home country simultaneously negotiates with each foreign country, where the bargaining outcome in each bilateral negotiation is determined by the Nash bargaining solution and under the assumption that the Nash bargaining outcome will be successfully achieved in the other bilateral negotiation. If we were to interpret this approach in terms of a delegated agent model, then we might imagine that the home country sends one agent to negotiate with one foreign country and another agent to negotiate with the other foreign country, where the home-country agents each maximize a common home-country welfare function but are unable to communicate with each other during the course of their respective bilateral negotiations.====To conduct our formal analysis, we use a trade model with a home country and two foreign countries. Our modeling framework includes the scenario of a neoclassical model with two goods as analyzed by Bagwell and Staiger, 2005, Bagwell and Staiger, 2010, Bagwell and Staiger, 2018 in which the home country imports the same good from each foreign country and exports a second good to the foreign countries. But our assumptions are sufficiently general to include other scenarios as well, such as when the home country imports substitute goods from the foreign countries and perhaps likewise exports substitute goods to the respective foreign countries. Since the foreign countries may export the same or close-substitute goods, the model allows for the possibility of discriminatory tariffs for the home country. We thus represent country welfare functions in reduced form as general functions of the four tariffs (two tariffs for the home country, and one tariff for each foreign country) imposed by the three countries. We assess efficiency relative to these country welfare functions, where a country's welfare function may include both economic and distributional concerns.====We begin our formal analysis by defining an interior Horn–Wolinsky solution for our no-rules setting. We then assume the existence of an interior Horn–Wolinsky solution and characterize its efficiency properties. We establish a sense in which the resulting tariffs are inefficient and too low, so that excessive liberalization occurs from the perspective of the three countries.====Formally, we start at an interior Horn–Wolinsky solution and explicitly construct a perturbation under which all four tariffs are increased in a manner that generates welfare gains for each of the three countries. Having thus constructed a particular tariff-increasing perturbation that is sufficient for Pareto gains for all countries, we then consider the necessary features of any Pareto-improving tariff perturbation, where we again start with an interior Horn–Wolinsky solution. Given that the model allows for four tariffs, and that each country has a direct interest in each of the four tariffs, we would not expect to find that Pareto gains are possible only if each individual tariff is perturbed toward a higher value. We do show, however, that, if all countries enjoy weak welfare gains under a small perturbation from an interior Horn–Wolinsky solution, then the perturbation cannot be characterized by “opportunistic” bilateral tariff changes in both bilateral relationships, where opportunistic bilateral tariff changes are bilateral tariff changes that harm the welfare of the non-participating country. Using this finding, we then show that, if under a small perturbation all countries enjoy weak welfare gains and at least one country strictly gains, then there must exist a bilateral relationship in which at least one tariff rises while the other tariff in that relationship can fall but only to a limited extent.====Hence, starting at an interior Horn–Wolinsky solution, it is not possible to make every country better off with a small perturbation that induces a weak reduction in the tariffs of every country, but it is possible to make every country better off with a perturbation that generates a small increase in the tariffs of every country. Based on these findings, we conclude that simultaneous bilateral tariff negotiations are associated with excessive liberalization when judged relative to the preferences of all countries. We are not aware of a previous equilibrium analysis that establishes this conclusion.====Turning now to the related literature, it is interesting to compare our results to those in a large literature that examines the possible third-party effects of preferential trading agreements. This literature imposes a significant restriction on the family of discriminatory tariffs (so that trade is free among preferred partners) and then explores different questions such as whether such agreements facilitate or hinder the achievement of global free trade.==== We include as a special case the possibility that countries maximize national income, and for this special case global free trade is of course efficient. Our finding of excess liberalization even for national-income-maximizing countries arises because we allow countries to pursue bilateral agreements in which they exchange discriminatory import subsidies and liberalize beyond free trade.====The Nash-in-Nash bargaining model is a workhorse model in applied work in Industrial Organization that studies surplus division in bilateral oligopoly, and our work here provides a theoretical foundation for related applications in the context of bilateral tariff negotiations. Relative to work in Industrial Organization, a novel feature of our analysis is that we study bilateral relationships with two-way interactions (each country both sells to and buys from its trading partner). Our focus on efficiency is also novel and is appropriate given our aim to study the welfare implications of bilateral tariff negotiations.====A quantitative analysis related to a number of the themes we explore here is contained in Bagwell et al. (2018a). In that paper, we embed a multi-sector model of trade between multiple countries into a model of inter-connected bilateral negotiations over tariffs, where the tariff negotiations are modeled according to the Nash-in-Nash approach. There we quantify the third-party externalities that are central to the theoretical findings described above, and we show that the distinct nature of these externalities with and without MFN is key to understanding the efficiency properties of the Horn–Wolinsky solutions under the different bargaining protocols that we report in that paper.====We note also that an extensive trade-policy literature uses Nash tariffs as a benchmark for understanding the value of multilateral tariff cooperation in GATT and now the WTO. The Nash benchmark is appealing, since it offers a coherent representation of the outcome that would be expected in the absence of any cooperation. At the same time, and as is well known, bilateral tariff agreements were also a feature of the pre-GATT era. From this perspective, an alternative theoretical benchmark in which countries simultaneously pursue bilateral tariff agreements is also appealing. Our analysis offers such an analysis for the no-rules setting with discriminatory tariffs. Valuable future work may explore how the theoretical results vary when the MFN rule is added.====Finally, our work is closely related to a sequence of papers by Bagwell and Staiger, 2005, Bagwell and Staiger, 2010, Bagwell and Staiger, 2018. These papers use a neoclassical trade model with three countries and two goods. As mentioned above, this model is included in the modeling framework of the present paper. The papers then go on to develop different insights about bilateral tariff negotiations in this modeling context.====Bagwell and Staiger (2005) show that, starting at any efficient vector of tariffs for the three countries, the home country and any one foreign country can always gain by extending bilateral tariff cuts to one another. Since the original tariffs are efficient, the bilateral tariff deal is necessarily opportunistic: the participating countries gain at the expense of the third-party foreign country, which suffers a terms-of-trade loss. This result suggests that the scope for bilaterally opportunistic trade deals is significant and indicates that an appropriately designed multilateral trade agreement can facilitate efficient outcomes for participating countries only if some restrictions are placed on the form of bilateral tariff deals. The MFN rule can be interpreted in this context. As Bagwell and Staiger (2005) argue, however, the MFN rule does not fully insulate a given foreign country from the terms-of-trade effects of a bilateral negotiation between the home country and the other foreign country.==== We note that Bagwell and Staiger (2005) develop their findings at a general level and do not study a specific extensive-form game of tariff bargaining among the three countries. Thus, unlike the present paper, they do not offer an equilibrium analysis of bargaining outcomes.====Bagwell and Staiger (2010) consider rules under which efficient outcomes can be achieved in a subgame perfect equilibrium of a sequential bargaining game for the three-country model when transfers are allowed, the MFN rule is required, and other restrictions on bilateral negotiations, including rules regarding reciprocity and renegotiation, may be imposed.==== The present paper differs in several respects: we analyze simultaneous bilateral tariff negotiations, do not allow transfers, consider a no-rules setting, use the Horn–Wolinsky solution concept and show that efficiency is then infeasible since equilibrium tariffs are too low. Finally, Bagwell and Staiger (2018) characterize the outcomes that can be achieved in a multilateral bargaining setting in which proposals are simultaneously made and any proposed outcome must satisfy the MFN rule along with the principle of multilateral reciprocity. As they show, in this “strong-rule” setting, countries are unable to alter the terms of trade, and as a consequence multilateral bargaining outcomes may be characterized while requiring only that countries make dominant-strategy proposals. They show that an efficient outcome can be achieved if and only if the initial tariff vector is such that the world price takes a particular value; otherwise, the resulting tariffs are higher than efficient.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic three-country model of trade that we analyze. As we discuss there, we consider a general family of welfare functions for countries. Section 3 contains our definition of an interior Horn–Wolinsky solution. Section 4 contains our construction of a Pareto-improving perturbation relative to an interior Horn–Wolinsky solution, and Section 5 provides related findings concerning the necessary features of Pareto-improving perturbations.

When calibrated to Chilean plant-level data, this difference is substantial.","Intermediate inputs comprise the bulk of international trade in goods for industrialized countries. A recent empirical literature examining firm- and plant-level data finds that imported inputs are concentrated among relatively few producers, and there is substantial heterogeneity in the share of input expenditures spent on imports.==== In addition, importing inputs raises plant-level revenue productivity—revenues per unit of input expenditures—and trade liberalization results in within-plant productivity gains.==== These observations suggest that individual firms' importing decisions may be important for quantifying the overall gains from trade.====In this paper, I evaluate how plant-level input sourcing decisions affect the measurement of welfare gains from trade. I develop a general equilibrium trade model in which plants producing final goods use a continuum of intermediate inputs which can be produced in different countries at different unit costs and shipped internationally subject to proportional trade costs, as in the Ricardian model of Eaton and Kortum (2002). For each input, a plant chooses whether to pay a fixed cost to “source” the input – buy it from the cheapest location – or to buy it domestically. A plant thus faces a tradeoff between the higher fixed cost required to source more inputs and the lower marginal production cost that comes from sourcing those additional inputs. Plants differ in their underlying productive efficiency, and more efficient plants find it profitable to source – and hence import – more inputs than relatively inefficient plants.====To a first-order approximation, welfare gains from trade cost reductions are proportional to the change in the aggregate domestic expenditure share (one minus the import share) and inversely proportional to the general equilibrium elasticity of the aggregate import/domestic ratio (henceforth the “equilibrium trade elasticity”). This is a modified version of the formula from Arkolakis et al. (2012) (henceforth ACR), which relates welfare gains to the aggregate import share and a partial or gravity-based trade elasticity, i.e., the elasticity of imports with respect to trade costs, holding fixed country-level aggregates (henceforth the “gravity-based trade elasticity” or “gravity elasticity”). Therefore, the crucial difference between welfare gains in my model and gains implied by the ACR formula is in these elasticities of trade volumes with respect to trade costs.==== In my model, trade costs affect equilibrium aggregate import volumes through two margins: the fraction of inputs sourced (the “sourcing margin”) and the fraction of sourced inputs actually imported (the “intensive margin”). The equilibrium trade elasticity captures both these margins while the gravity-based trade elasticity captures only the latter, because the sourcing margin is subsumed into a cross-sectional gravity equation's country-level fixed effects. In particular, as long as the elasticity of the sourcing margin is larger than the elasticity of the intensive margin, the gravity elasticity is smaller than the equilibrium trade elasticity, and so the ACR formula overstates welfare gains from trade.====The difference between the equilibrium trade elasticity and the gravity elasticity in my model is an endogenous object that potentially varies with the level of trade costs, so I show that quantitatively, this difference can be substantial. When calibrated to Chilean plant-level and aggregate data, the targeted gravity elasticity is 5, and the equilibrium elasticity is just over 7. This translates into a local elasticity of welfare with respect to the aggregate domestic expenditure share that is about 30% smaller (in absolute value) than the one implied by the ACR formula. Moreover, this first-order result provides a reasonably good approximation for large changes as well: welfare gains relative to autarky are 2.56 percent in the model, as opposed to 3.90 percent implied by the ACR formula, again a difference of about 30%.====These results imply that endogenous input sourcing decisions, rather than heterogeneity in import shares per se, are important in explaining the difference in welfare gains relative to models that satisfy the ACR conditions. Without an input sourcing margin, there is no heterogeneity in import shares, and the ACR formula with the gravity elasticity applies. However, with exogenously given heterogeneous plant-level import shares, regardless of the distribution of import share and size, the equilibrium elasticity is smaller than the gravity elasticity, and the ranking between the gains from trade implied by the model and the gains implied by the ACR formula is flipped. From this point of view, heterogeneity in import shares is important for welfare gains because it is informative about the sensitivity of input sourcing decisions to plants' profitability, which determines the elasticity of the sourcing margin at the aggregate level.====This paper is related to recent work on quantifying the gains from trade in environments with plant-level importing decisions. Blaum et al. (2015) show that in a model with heterogeneous import shares across plants, the joint distribution of changes in import shares and size characterizes the effect of changes in trade costs on the consumer price index. They characterize when the ACR formula overestimates or underestimates these price gains in terms of preference and technology parameters. My analysis mainly differs in two ways: first, I focus on welfare – as measured by aggregate consumption – rather than consumer prices; the difference is that welfare takes into account the resources used for importing. In Blaum et al., welfare gains from trade do not always follow the same pattern as their measures of aggregate price gains, suggesting that consumer prices can be a poor indicator of welfare in models with heterogeneous importing decisions. Second, I characterize the departure from the ACR formula in terms of the difference between the equilibrium trade elasticity and the gravity elasticity. In addition, my results implicitly compare across models (i.e. with heterogeneous and common import shares) with a fixed gravity-based trade elasticity. Blaum, Lelarge, and Peters, on the other hand, compare heterogeneous-share and common-share models with a common set of underlying parameters, and potentially different trade elasticities.====Also related to this paper are Gopinath and Neiman (2011) and Antràs et al. (2014). Gopinath and Neiman show that heterogeneity in the adjustment of the number of inputs imported by Argentinean plants contributes to high-frequency movements in aggregate productivity. In contrast, I focus on the measurement of welfare gains from trade, and highlight the comparison to a model without heterogeneity controlling for the aggregate trade share and gravity-based trade elasticity. My model shares with Antràs et al. (2014) the Ricardian structure of trade given the sourcing decisions, but differs in the details of the sourcing decision. In Antràs et al. (2014), a plant chooses the set of countries from which to source all its inputs, and sourcing from more countries requires paying a higher fixed cost, while in my model a plant chooses the set of inputs to source from all countries, facing a higher cost of sourcing a larger set of inputs. They focus on the margin of the number of source countries in accounting for import flows. In both these papers, the plant-level import share is the product of a sourcing decision and an intensive margin. In Antràs et al. (2014), however, sourcing decisions are origin-dependent, so that a gravity-based elasticity would capture both margins, while in Gopinath and Neiman (2011), as it is here, the sourcing decision does not vary by origin, so the gravity elasticity would only capture the intensive margin. My results clarify that quantifying welfare gains in models of input sourcing relative to gains implied by the ACR formula depends on these details of the input sourcing technology. Also, in contrast to these papers, I analytically characterize the plant's problem and express aggregates in terms of a small number of variables and parameters. Thus, my model allows a transparent identification of parameters, and I map parameters governing the costs of importing and firm heterogeneity to moments of the endogenous cross-sectional distributions of import shares and plant size along with key aggregate statistics.====The welfare results are also related to recent work by Levchenko and Zhang (2014), Ossa (2015), and Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare (2014), who show that gains from trade differ in multi-sector models compared to one-sector models due to variation in trade shares or trade elasticities across sectors. These papers assess the discrepancy between the one-sector welfare formula and the actual gains for given parameters, which would result in the aggregate gravity elasticity varying across models. In a different vein, Simonovska and Waugh (2014) show that matching a particular cross-sectional statistic in trade models with different underlying plant-level features results in different measures of the partial trade elasticity, and thus differing gains from trade across those models even though they all satisfy the ACR formula.====This paper also relates to empirical papers by Amiti and Konings (2007), Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008), and Halpern et al. (2009), who all find that imported inputs raise plant-level productivity, estimated as revenue per unit of input expenditures.==== In the language of Foster et al. (2008), importing raises revenue total factor productivity (TFPR) but does not necessarily raise physical productivity (TFPQ). In my model, sourcing more inputs lowers input prices, so a plant that sources (and hence imports) more inputs appears more productive in the sense that it produces more revenues with the same expenditures on inputs than a plant that sources fewer inputs. Importing does not change affect plants' underlying technical efficiency (TFPQ), but importing plants have higher revenue productivity and are larger than nonimporting plants, both because they tend to be more efficient producers, and because importing decisions in the presence of fixed costs amplifies differences in revenue productivity. In addition, liberalizing trade generates within-plant gains in revenue productivity at importing plants, as they reduce their marginal costs by sourcing and importing more inputs, thereby producing more revenues per unit of expenditure on inputs. In the calibrated model, plant-level revenue productivity gains are in line with those estimated for Chile in Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008), and within-plant revenue productivity gains contribute substantially more than reallocation of resources from low-efficiency to high-efficiency plants in accounting for the aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) gains from trade.====Section 2 sets out the model, and Section 3 characterizes the welfare predictions and the difference between the equilibrium and gravity-based trade elasticities in a symmetric version of the model. Section 4 calibrates the model to Chile and quantifies the welfare implications of the model, while Section 5 considers sensitivity of the quantitative results to some parameter values and extends the welfare characterization to the case of asymmetric countries.",Imported inputs and the gains from trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300807,23 October 2019,2019,Research Article,208.0

I test these hypotheses using unique panel data on more than 100,000 firm pairs worldwide. In line with the model's predictions, knowledge-intensive parent firms choose higher ownership shares in their affiliates, yet this relationship is less pronounced the stronger the IPR protection in the affiliate's country. In addition, higher physical capital intensity of the affiliate is associated with lower ownership shares. These findings are robust to controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across countries, ====, and firms, providing strong support for the unifying theory of ==== boundaries.","What determines firm boundaries? This question, posed eighty years ago by Coase (1937), is more relevant than ever in the age of multinational enterprises that span their boundaries around the globe. According to UNCTAD (2011), roughly one quarter of the world GDP in 2010 was generated within multinational firms' boundaries. In 2015, the value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions totaled $1.6 trillion (Reuters, 2016) – a number equivalent to the GDP of Canada, or 2.2% of the world GDP. Why do multinational enterprises expend managerial time and investment bankers' fees to integrate other companies into firm boundaries rather than simply cooperate with their business partners at arm's-length? The discussion of this question in the economics literature has been centered around two major paradigms. An earlier research strand emphasizes the importance of a multinational firm's knowledge (intangible assets) and sees the role of integration in preventing this knowledge from being dissipated by an affiliate.==== A more recent strand of literature suggests that integration can mitigate the hold-up problem arising in situations where one or both parties make investments into relationship-specific, non-contractible assets.==== Although from a practitioner's point of view both the threat of knowledge dissipation and the hold-up problem are considered to be relevant obstacles to productive cross-border collaborations (see, e.g., Midler, 2009), these two major paradigms have existed so far as disjoint narratives, with hardly any overlap. This paper bridges the ‘knowledge-dissipation’ and the ‘hold-up’ paradigms of multinational firm boundaries in a unifying framework and tests its novel predictions using unique panel data on global ownership links between firm pairs.====The point of departure of this paper is the seminal framework by Antràs and Helpman (2004) – the archetypal representative of the hold-up approach to multinational firm boundaries, which I suitably adapt to incorporate the knowledge-dissipation paradigm. As in the original framework, production of final goods requires two parties: a firm's headquarters (HQ) and a manufacturing producer (the affiliate). The HQ specializes in the provision of intangible assets (e.g., a blueprint or design for a new product), while the manufacturer invests in relationship-specific physical assets necessary for the production of final goods. The key distinct feature of the current model compared to Antràs and Helpman (2004) is that, rather than sourcing physical inputs from a manufacturing producer and combining them with intangible assets on her own site, the HQ has to transfer her knowledge to the manufacturer.==== The manufacturing producer can steal this knowledge and independently fabricate a ‘knock-off’ product. The threat of knowledge dissipation adversely affects the willingness of the HQ to provide intangible assets to the manufacturer. At the same time, the producer anticipates that his investment into relationship-specific physical assets may not be fully compensated by the HQ and underinvests in these assets. It is in this sense that the current paper narrates a ‘tale of two property rights’: The HQ aims to protect her intellectual property while providing sufficient incentives for the manufacturing producer to invest in his physical assets.====What is the role of a firm's ownership structure in this context? If courts cannot fully verify and enforce the transmission of knowledge and the investment into physical capital, parties negotiate the division of surplus ex-post (i.e., after knowledge has been transferred and investment into physical capital has been sunk). Following the Property Rights Theory (PRT) by Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990), I assume that ex-post bargaining takes place both under integration and arm's-length transaction. The distribution of surplus, however, is sensitive to the ownership structure. More specifically, integration of a producer into firm boundaries has two counteracting effects. On the one hand, integration mitigates the threat of knowledge dissipation and ensures a higher transfer of intangible assets.==== On the other hand, since an integrated producer does not possess ownership rights over physical assets, he is relatively more exposed to ex-post hold-up by the HQ and underinvests in these assets as compared to a non-integrated manufacturer. The optimal ownership structure thus trades off the inefficiencies from the underprovision of knowledge against the underinvestment in physical assets to maximize the joint surplus from the cooperation.====This theoretical framework yields two key predictions. First, the relative attractiveness of integration versus arm's-length transaction increases in the importance of a multinational firm's intangible assets in the production process (henceforth, knowledge intensity), and decreases in the importance of a manufacturing firm's tangible assets (henceforth, physical capital intensity). The intuition behind this prediction is well aligned with the general logic of the PRT: The need for incentivizing a given party's activities increases in the importance of this party's contribution to the production process. Hence, if knowledge intensity increases, the HQ has a higher incentive to integrate the producer into firm boundaries to reduce the threat of knowledge dissipation and, thereby, ensure a sufficiently high knowledge transfer. Conversely, as physical capital intensity increases, the HQ is primarily concerned with incentivizing the producer's investments into tangible assets, which can be done by relinquishing the property rights over physical capital to the manufacturer. The second key prediction suggests that the direct effect of knowledge intensity on the choice of the ownership structure systematically varies with the strength of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the producer's country. More specifically, I demonstrate that stronger IPR protection attenuates the positive effect of knowledge intensity on the relative attractiveness of integration. Intuitively, if the HQ's intellectual property is better protected in the producer's country, the need for integrating the manufacturer in order to minimize the threat of knowledge dissipation decreases.====Motivated by the subsequent empirical setup, I further verify that the above-mentioned predictions extend to the case in which the HQ chooses a continuous ownership share in her affiliate, rather than deciding only between the two ‘extreme’ cases of integration vs. arm's-length transaction. In this extended model, a higher ownership share in the manufacturing unit strengthens the HQ's bargaining power during ex-post negotiations and reduces the bargaining power of the affiliate. I show that the HQ's choice whether to obtain a marginally higher ownership share in the manufacturing company is driven by the same set of explanatory factors as the binary integration decision.====What is the value added of this unifying framework to the stand-alone knowledge-dissipation and hold-up paradigms?==== First, this framework can rationalize the following empirical puzzle that cannot be property explained by the two individual paradigms: Why do we observe outsourcing of knowledge-intensive production processes to countries with week IPR protection?==== The hold-up paradigm is silent on this question, as knowledge dissipation and IPR protection play no role in this paradigm. Although the knowledge-dissipation paradigm provides an answer to this question, it appears to be somewhat unsatisfactory, as it can explain the existence of outsourcing in countries with weak IPR protection only by invoking an ==== (governance) cost of integration. In contrast, the unifying framework developed in this paper follows the PRT by ==== deriving the costs and benefits of integration from the same set of fundamental inefficiencies. According to the present model, a multinational company may outsource its production despite the risk of knowledge dissipation in order to reduce the hold-up problem from the viewpoint of the manufacturer and, thereby, incentivize the latter's investment into relationship-specific physical assets. Second, and related, the unifying framework can rationalize a positive link between IPR protection and foreign direct investment (FDI), previously reported in the literature.==== While the hold-up paradigm is once again silent on this relationship, the knowledge-dissipation paradigm would predict more outsourcing (licensing), rather than FDI, in countries with better IPR protection (see, e.g., Barba Navaretti and Venables, 2004). According to the current model, an improvement in IPR protection reduces the ex-post bargaining position of the independent manufacturer and decreases his ex-ante investment into physical assets. If the associated drop in firm profits is sufficiently grave, the HQ may decide to integrate the (foreign) manufacturer into firm boundaries, leading to more (foreign) direct investment.====I test the model's predictions using global data on ownership links within multinational firms from the Orbis database by Bureau van Dijk (BvD). This database is uniquely suited for investigating firm-level determinants of multinational firm's boundaries by encompassing the following three key features. First, it contains information on the outcome variable of interest – the direct ownership shares (in percent) of parent companies in their affiliates in a biannual panel from 2004 to 2014. Second, it provides yearly balance sheet information on the value of a HQ's intangible assets (such as patents and copyrights), as well as the value of the affiliate's tangible assets (such as equipment and machinery), which I use to construct proxies for knowledge and physical capital intensity, respectively. Third, it is characterized by a large international coverage, comprising headquarters and affiliates around the globe. I enrich this database with multiple proxies for IPR protection to explore the interaction between knowledge intensity and intellectual property rights protection in the affiliate's country in their impact on firm boundaries. The combination of these features allows me to provide a large-scale investigation of the effects of knowledge and physical capital intensity on multinational firms' ownership structures, while fully controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across countries, industries, and firm pairs using fixed effects (FE).====Fig. 1 below provides a first glance at the data by plotting ownership shares against industry/country measures of knowledge intensity and physical capital intensity.==== More specifically, the left panel plots mean values of ownership shares by industry and country of the HQ against mean knowledge intensity in this industry/country, whereas the right panel plots mean values of ownership shares in the industry/country of the affiliate against mean physical capital intensity in this industry/country. The regression lines and the associated estimates, presented in the lower right corner of the respective figure, show significant correlations in line with the first prediction: Headquarters active in knowledge-intensive industries tend to integrate their affiliates more tightly into firm boundaries, whereas ownership shares are lower for higher physical capital intensities in the affiliate's industry. Clearly, these raw correlations can be confounded by a multitude of country-, industry-, and firm-specific characteristics. I verify, however, that these relationships prevail after controlling for various observable factors and several dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity in the data.====I bring the model's predictions to the data in three complementary steps. As a first pass at the data, I explore conditional correlations of ownership shares from 2014 with the lagged value of a HQ's intangible assets (as well as its interaction with IPR protection) and the lagged physical capital intensity of an affiliate in the cross-section of firm pairs. Throughout specifications, I control for all observable and unobservable characteristics of the parent's and affiliate's countries (such as economic development or institutions) and industries (e.g., relationship-specificity) via HQ and affiliate country and industry FE. Furthermore, I include country- and industry-pair FE to account for all characteristics specific to a ==== of countries (such as geographical and cultural distance) and industries (e.g., the parent's and the affiliate's down- vs. upstreamness). Conditional on the above-mentioned set of FE and a wide range of observable firm-specific factors, I find that the ownership share in a given affiliate is positively correlated with lagged knowledge intensity of the HQ and negatively associated with lagged physical capital intensity of the affiliate, in line with the model's first prediction. Furthermore, consistent with the second prediction, I find that the positive relationship between the HQ's intangible assets and her ownership share in a given affiliate is less pronounced the stronger IPR protection in the affiliate's country.====In the second step, I address one of the two main challenges to identification – the issue of reverse causality. It is conceivable that some firms choose their factor intensities in anticipation of the ownership structure from the subsequent period, in which case the explanatory variables from the first empirical exercise would be the outcome, rather than the cause, of ownership decisions. To account for this possibility, I construct measures of knowledge and physical capital intensity at the aggregate level of industry/country cells. More specifically, I exploit Orbis data on more than 5 million firm-year observations within the time span of 2004–2013 to construct a leave-out median value of intangible assets by HQ's industry/country and a leave-out median value of tangible assets by affiliate's industry/country.==== Since these values are fairly exogenous to the ownership structure of a single company, approximating knowledge and physical capital intensities with their industry/country counterparts alleviates the reverse causality concern. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across country- and industry-pairs using FE, I continue to find evidence supportive of the models predictions. Furthermore, the findings are confirmed in within-firm specifications with HQ firm FE.====In the third step, I tackle the second major challenge to identification – the omitted variables bias. Although the first two econometric models control for observable firm characteristics, there can be unobserved firm-specific factors that confound the relationship between factor intensities and ownership shares in the cross-sectional analysis. A prime example of a potential confounding factor is productivity, which is unobservable by the econometrician but has been shown theoretically to have an effect on firm boundaries (see, e.g., Kohler and Smolka, 2015). To address this concern, I exploit changes in ownership shares due to lagged variation in the HQ's intangible assets and the affiliate's tangible assets in the panel of 2004–2014. This approach allows me to control for unobserved heterogeneity across cooperating partners via HQ and affiliate ==== FE. Moreover, I account for all time-invariant factors specific to a given ownership link via firm-==== FE. Controlling for firm-pair FE, I find robust evidence in line with the model's predictions: A lagged increase in the HQ's intangible assets raises her ownership share in the affiliate, while a lagged increase in the affiliate's tangible assets reduces the ownership share. Overall, the evidence uncovered in the three-pronged empirical exercise provides strong support for the unifying theory of multinational firm boundaries.====In an important set of robustness checks, I verify that my results are fully robust to accounting for the importance of a parent firm's intangible assets in the production process of an affiliate using a novel measure of interindustry knowledge applicability. For the construction of this measure, I exploit information on more than 23 million patent citations from the NBER Patent Database to approximate the applicability of knowledge generated within a given industry to all other industries. I then weigh the HQ's intangible assets with this industry-pair measure of knowledge applicability to construct a refined proxy for knowledge intensity of a given production process. Throughout specifications, I continue to find a positive effect of knowledge intensity on ownership shares.====This paper contributes to a body of research investigating the organization of firms across borders. In their review of this literature, Antràs and Rossi-Hansberg (2009, p.58) stress that “past research has arguably focused too much on hold-up inefficiencies as the main drivers of the internalization decision”, whereas real-world organizational decisions such as “Intel's choice to internalize fully their operations in Costa Rica may be better explained in terms of fear of technological expropriation than in terms of a double-sided hold-up problem.” This observation squares well with the recent influential study by Atalay et al. (2014), which documents that upstream units of U.S. firms ship very small shares of their output to the firms' downstream establishments, and almost one-half of upstream establishments do not conduct any shipments inside firm boundaries (cf. Ramondo et al., 2016, for further related evidence on U.S. multinationals). The authors interpret this evidence as indicating that a primary purpose of integration is to mediate efficient transfers of intangible inputs within firms rather than sourcing intermediate inputs from their affiliates. The present paper contributes to this discourse by showing that a HQ's intangible assets, as well as their interaction with IPR protection in the affiliate's country, are indeed important drivers of multinational firm boundaries. Yet, to be clear, this paper does not invalidate the conventional hold-up approach but rather shows how the latter can be reconciled with the knowledge-dissipation paradigm in a unifying framework to obtain a more profound understanding of the organization of multinational enterprises.====From the theoretical perspective, this paper is related to Chen et al. (2012), who consider the dissipation of knowledge and the hold-up problem in a single framework.==== As in the current paper, the authors predict that the attractiveness of integration versus arm's-length transaction increases in the knowledge intensity and decreases in the physical capital intensity of the production process. The key difference between the two approaches is that the current paper builds on the PRT, rather than the TCT (see footnote 2 for distinction). Empirically, it remains an open question whether the PRT or the TCT serves as a better model of firms' integration decisions. For instance, Corcos et al. (2013), Nunn and Trefler, 2008, Nunn and Trefler, 2013, Kohler and Smolka, 2014, Kohler and Smolka, 2015, and Antràs and Chor (2013) provide evidence consistent with the PRT, while Acemoglu et al. (2010) put forward some evidence pointing in the direction of the TCT. Recent work by Antràs (2015) and Eppinger and Kukharskyy (2019) attempts to discriminate between the two elemental theories of the firm and finds empirical support in favor of the PRT. Putting aside the question of the empirical precedence of the PRT vs. TCT, the value added of my unifying framework is threefold. First, the PRT-based approach delivers a novel prediction regarding the negative interaction between knowledge intensity and IPR protection on integration, which finds strong empirical support in the data. As shown in this paper, this interaction effect turns out to be ambiguous under the TCT. Second, while the direct effect of IPR protection on the prevalence of integration is unambiguously negative in Chen et al. (2012), my model allows for a positive effect of IPR protection on the integration decision. This allows me to rationalize the existing empirical evidence on the positive link between IPR and FDI (see footnote 9). Lastly, the PRT approach has a general advantage over TCT by deriving the costs and benefits of integration from the same set of inefficiencies, without resorting to the exogenous cost of integration.====From the empirical perspective, this paper relates to a recent but rapidly growing literature investigating the link between headquarter intensity, defined as the relative importance of a HQ's inputs compared to inputs supplied by the manufacturing unit, and the international make-or-buy decision; see, e.g., Antràs, 2003, Antràs, 2015, Bernard etal. (2010), Nunn and Trefler, 2008, Nunn and Trefler, 2013. The vast majority of this literature has approximated the relative attractiveness of integration using U.S. industry-level data on the share of intra-firm imports in total imports, while proxying headquarter intensity with various measures of R&D-, capital-, and skill-intensity of a given U.S. industry. Corcos et al. (2013) and Kohler and Smolka, 2014, Kohler and Smolka, 2015 bring this approach to the firm level using French and Spanish import data, respectively, and approximate the headquarter intensity with capital and skill intensity of the importing firm. All above-mentioned contributions generally find a positive relationship between intra-firm imports and the employed proxies for headquarter intensity. The current paper complements these studies in four major respects. First, I exploit the firm-==== structure of my data to provide a pioneering investigation of the relationships between firm boundaries and factor intensities of ==== sides of the ownership link. Second, I use unique information on HQ's intangible assets to study the role of knowledge in the organization of firms. Third, I investigate how knowledge intensity interacts with IPR protection. Lastly, I make progress towards identifying the effects of both parties' factor intensities by exploring time variation in intangible and tangible assets using panel data on more than 100,000 firm pairs worldwide.====Previous studies have analyzed alternative determinants of firm boundaries using Orbis data. Eppinger and Kukharskyy (2019) uncover strong evidence that better contracting institutions in affiliates' countries favor higher ownership shares, particularly in relationship-specific industries. Kukharskyy (2016) finds that firms led by long-term oriented managers own higher shares in their affiliates. Gorodnichenko et al. (2018) find that higher cultural distance between the HQ's and the affiliate's managers is associated with lower ownership shares. The current paper fully accounts for the above-mentioned alternative explanations using FE (by affiliate country/industry, HQ firm, and firm-pair, respectively) and presents novel evidence on the effects of intangible and tangible assets.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 describes the empirical approach and the data. Section 4 reports the estimation results. Section 5 concludes.","A tale of two property rights: Knowledge, physical assets, and multinational firm boundaries",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300832,22 October 2019,2019,Research Article,209.0

(2013), and Dávila and Korinek (2017)). By limiting excessive capital inflows, the goal of macroprudential policy is to mitigate the risk of financial crises and the resulting highly persistent output losses.==== However, financial crises in current models of macroprudential policy have a temporary effect on output.==== This raises the question of how the optimal macroprudential policy changes in these models when financial crises have a permanent effect on the output level.====The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, I provide a new framework such that financial crises have a persistent effect on output level. To achieve this goal, I introduce endogenous growth into a small open economy (SOE) model with occasionally binding collateral constraints that has been widely used in the literature (see Jeanne and Korinek (2018) and Benigno et al. (2016)). In a quantitative exercise, I show that my model is able to match the output dynamics during the crises episodes. Second, I analyze the impact of macroprudential policy on financial stability and growth in the new framework. Unlike the existing literature, there is a new policy trade-off between the cyclical and trend consumption growth. By constraining external borrowing to reduce financial instability, the optimal macroprudential policy hurts trend growth in good times but reduces the permanent output losses from crises. A quantitative exercise suggests that the optimal macroprudential policy significantly enhances financial stability (reducing the probability of crises by two thirds) at the cost of lowering average growth by a small amount.====The key feature of my model is an endogenous productivity process, which can be affected by the occasionally binding collateral constraints. In each period, private agents can use resources to invest in a technology that increases productivity. In a crisis, when the collateral constraint binds, they are forced to cut spending and thus investment in the technology. As a result, crises are associated with lower productivity growth. Importantly, growth rates only converge to the long-run average level after crises, which captures the persistent effect of financial crises. Unlike existing models in the literature, output in my model follows a trajectory that is parallel to its pre-crisis trend after financial crises, consistent with the data (see Fig. 1).====This new framework is appropriate to analyze the impact of macroprudential policy on growth. Unsurprisingly, there is room in my model for policy intervention to address over-borrowing. Like other papers (e.g., Jeanne and Korinek (2018)), I analyze the role of macroprudential policy by considering a social planner with an instrument to manage capital flows, i.e. macroprudential capital controls.==== Unlike the existing literature, however, I do so in an environment that allows me to evaluate the policy’s impact on average growth. There is a new policy trade-off between the cyclical and trend consumption growth. Specifically, the macroprudential policy reduces the permanent output losses from crises at the cost of lowering trend growth in good times.====In general, the impact of macroprudential policy on average growth is ambiguous. On one hand, the macroprudential policy increases growth during crises because it reduces financial vulnerabilities. On the other hand, it also lowers growth during normal periods because it reduces external borrowing and thus the expenditures to increase productivity. The calibrated version of my model reveals that optimal macroprudential policy reduces the probability of crises from 6.2 percent to 1.9 percent (about two-thirds), at the cost of lowering average growth by 0.01 percentage point. Therefore, the growth cost of policy intervention is quantitatively small. This result is robust to many alternative specifications of the model and due to the absence of direct growth externality in the setting. In one extension of the model, I show that macroprudential policy can have a larger impact on growth rate once introducing growth externality.====Furthermore, I find that the welfare gains from the optimal macroprudential policy are equivalent to a 0.06 percent permanent increase in annual consumption. Like in the existing literature, the optimal macroprudential policy increases welfare by limiting the likelihood and severity of financial crises, thereby helping agents to smooth consumption. In fact, in the model, that effect is stronger with endogenous growth. However, macroprudential policy also reduces growth in normal times. The cost of lowering trend growth has significant welfare consequences, which explains why the optimal policy only lowers average growth by a small amount. Furthermore, even if the welfare gains from smoothing the cyclical consumption growth have been enhanced by endogenous growth, the probability of crises has been driven down considerably by this optimal policy. Overall, the size of the welfare gains from macroprudential policy are similar to models with exogenous productivity (see Jeanne and Korinek (2018)).====However, the macroprudential policy can have a much larger welfare impact once it is jointly used with an additional instrument that helps reduce the cost of financial crises ex post. I analyze two such instruments in my economy. One instrument is an asset price subsidy that can be used to increase the price of collateral in a crisis like in Benigno et al. (2016). The second instrument, which is new to the literature and is made possible by the endogenous growth, is a tax/subsidy on the productivity investment (growth subsidy for brevity) that can be used to change the composition of spending. Both instruments can enhance the welfare impact of macroprudential policy since they help to relax the borrowing constraint. In the end, the optimal policy mix consists of both an ex-ante and ex-post intervention, which can generate larger welfare benefits than using the ex-ante macroprudential policy alone (see Jeanne and Korinek (forthcoming) and Benigno et al. (2013)).","Financial stability, growth and macroprudential policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219961830326X,19 October 2019,2019,Research Article,210.0

We find a substantive and persistent increase in the share of international bond placements denominated in issuers' home currencies, potentially mitigating currency mismatch. This trend appears to have accelerated since the global financial crisis. We find that global financial conditions as well as issuers' country ==== history determine the change in home currency issuance. We present a model illustrating how temporary changes in relative currency-denomination costs can lead to persistent changes in the currency composition of bond issuance.","Large firms in small countries often rely on global capital markets to raise funds. However, most of these firms' expenses and revenues are denominated in local currencies, so that borrowing in foreign currency may lead to mismatch issues on their balance sheets.==== Global investors finance themselves predominantly in a handful of global currencies (the U.S. Dollar, the euro, the British pound, the yen, and the Swiss franc) and also prefer to avoid currency mismatch on their balance sheets.==== The resulting mismatch between global funding currencies and local borrowing needs necessarily resides with one of these parties. Moreover, the mismatch associated with bond placements cannot be fully hedged because foreign exchange derivatives tend to have much shorter maturities than corporate debt.====A priori, since global investors' capacities to hedge and diversify currency risks far exceed those of small-country corporate borrowers, it would be better if investors could bear the currency mismatch through corporate borrowers issuing debt in their own currencies. Historically, however, this has not been the equilibrium outcome—borrowers from non-global currency countries usually do not borrow internationally in their own currency, a phenomenon Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999) popularly dubbed “original sin” in the literature.====Difficulties issuing in domestic currency may originate domestically, perhaps from poor domestic policies or institutions (Burger and Warnock, 2003, Burger and Warnock, 2007), or alternatively from the structural features of global capital markets (Eichengreen and Hausmann, 1999; Hausmann and Panizza, 2011).==== However, many countries' domestic policies and institutions have improved over time. Most notably, inflation stabilization, often achieved through recently-adopted inflation targeting policies, has garnered several previously-suspect countries new credibility. Regimes with formal inflation targets have not only proven to be durable, but also have exhibited less exchange rate volatility, and fewer sudden stops.==== It is therefore possible that these domestic policy improvements have led to increased home currency issuance in international bond markets.====In this paper, we document that in recent years there has been an increase in the prevalence of local currency denomination of international bonds and a secular decline in the use of global currencies in bonds placed by corporates from small countries. Moreover, this decline substantially accelerated after 2008.==== We find that both domestic policies and global market structure influence bond currency denomination. Specifically, a temporary disruption in global financial markets led to an increase in home currency issuance by firms from countries with a history of stable inflation. After establishing this stylized fact, we present a simple model that illustrates a mechanism that could explain the observed patterns in the data.====Using micro-level data from Dealogic's DCM Analytics, we analyze the currency denomination of over 20,000 international bonds issued by nearly 3000 firms from 30 non-global currency countries between 1995 and 2016. We find that firms' abilities to borrow internationally in their own country's currency have significantly increased over the last 20 years, particularly since 2008. We limit our empirical analysis to international bonds for three reasons: first, there is no allocation problem for currency mismatch for debt issued in domestic markets, since both borrowers and lenders generally operate in local currency; second, foreign participation in local bond markets can be very volatile, while issuance in international markets is more stable; third, the data available on international bond issuance are much more consistent across countries and therefore allow for a more systematic analysis.====We next examine the characteristics of non-global currency countries that experienced a substantive increase in the share of deals issued in home currency after the crisis using issue-level panel regressions. We find that the most prominent characteristic determining whether borrowers from a given country experienced an increase in home currency issuance following the global financial crisis is their inflation history. After separating our sample into non-global-currency advanced economies==== and emerging economies, we find that in each sub-sample, those with lower inflation before the crisis experienced a larger increase in home currency issuance. While all advanced economies experienced an increase in the probability of home currency issuance, those with low pre-crisis inflation experienced a 17 percentage point increase, nearly twice as large as the 10 percentage point increase for countries with high inflation. Among emerging market borrowers, those from low inflation countries experienced an increase comparable in magnitude to those from low-inflation advanced economies (14 percentage points), while those from high-inflation countries experienced none. These findings are robust to a variety of alternative specifications, as well as the inclusion of country-industry fixed effects, firm fixed effects, and other control variables. Interestingly, a country's inflation history, rather than the adoption of inflation targeting per se determines whether a country experienced a small or a large increase in home currency issuance following the crisis.====We highlight two important features of the increase in home currency issuance: First, the increase in home currency issuance appears to coincide with the global financial crisis (2008–09) and does not appear to be driven by the euro crisis (2010−11). Second, we distinguish between financial and non-financial borrowers.==== After controlling for bond and industry characteristics as well as firm fixed effects, we find that the increase in home currency issuance in the aftermath of the crisis was entirely driven by financial firms. Moreover, the increase in home currency issuance only shows a sensitivity to macro variables, such as inflation, among the financial firms.====Overall, our data suggest roles for both domestic policies, consistent with Burger and Warnock (2007),==== and features of international capital markets in explaining the currency denomination of international bonds. The global financial crisis likely brought about a temporary increase in the cost of borrowing in global currencies. Countries with better fundamentals prior to the crisis experienced a larger increase in the share of home currency bond issuance afterwards. These results highlight the interplay between domestic policies and universal features of international capital markets in explaining currency denomination. A good illustration is our finding that there is no increase in home currency issuance for emerging markets with high inflation. For some countries, domestic fundamentals are too poor for global shocks to make a difference, suggesting that the pre-crisis currency premium for them dominates any reduction in the relative premium as a result of global market conditions.====What was the specific change in global market conditions that we believe drove the relative reduction in the home currency premium? In 2008–09 we observed a rapid fall in asset values, increased volatility and uncertainty in the markets, as well as the repricing of risks. These were followed by rapid declines in policy rates to their effective lower bounds, and shortages of global currencies following a flight to quality. While we cannot pin down the exact cause, we hypothesize that a crucial change was the shortage of U.S. dollar funding, as documented, among others, by Caballero and Farhi (2017); Jiang et al. (2018). Indeed, we show that spreads on dollar-denominated bonds issued by firms outside of global currency countries increased substantially in 2008. While this dollar shortage was temporary, our results suggest that their effects on home currency issuance were persistent.====To demonstrate the mechanism behind this hysteresis, we propose a simple model of the choice of bond issue currency denomination. Our model illustrates the circumstances under which changes in global conditions might induce firms to increase the share of their international debt issuance in home currencies. Most of the literature to date concentrates on one part of the borrower's tradeoff—the costs and benefits of issuing in home currencies. Our study also emphasizes how changes in global conditions—in particular, the relative costs of issuing in a global currency—help explain the recent increase in home currency issuance. We examine the effect of a temporary reduction in country-specific premia – which likely occurred during the global financial crisis (GFC) – on home currency issuance. Our model demonstrates how in the event of such a decrease, firms may be induced to issue in their home currency. Moreover, if there is a premium associated with issuing in home currency for the first time, an increase in the share of firms “seasoned” in home currency issuance (i.e. those that have previously issued in home currency) has persistent effects, reducing the future cost of issuing in home currency, even after macroeconomic fundamentals return to normal. Furthermore, these effects are magnified by falling transaction costs in domestic currency issuance, as the home currency bond market thickens. However, firm characteristics and domestic macroeconomic conditions also influence the impact of the global shock.====Four features of the model support our empirical results: First, firms that are “seasoned” in home currency issuance are more likely to issue in home currency, while firms that are seasoned in foreign currency issuance are less likely to do so. In addition, seasoned firms pay lower interest on their issues than to first-time issuers. Second, firms in industries with larger export shares are less likely to issue in home currency, which is consistent with our advanced-economy sample of firms. Third, larger issues are less likely to be denominated in home currencies. Fourth, borrowers from countries with better fundamentals are more likely to have increased their share of home currency issuance following the global financial crisis.====Finally, the model's prediction that the transition to home currency issuance is easier the more similar a group of borrowers provides a potential channel for the dominant role of financial firms in the data. While financial firms are relatively homogeneous, the non-financial firms in our sample come from a large variety of industries. Our theory suggests that non-financial firms – who are more diverse in terms of their propensity to issue in home currency – would be less responsive as a group to a change in relative issuance costs by currency.====The paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2 we describe our data and present trends in the data that motivate our analysis. Section 3 reports our issue-level panel results. Section 4 presents a model that yields persistent changes in patterns of currency denomination as a result of temporary global shocks, as well as some further evidence from spread data that conforms to the assumptions of our model.

We show analytically the role of this mechanism on exports adjustment and document its importance using plant-level data.","Understanding the response of exports to aggregate shocks is key for determining the role of trade in driving the recovery from economic downturns. While a large class of open economy models imply that large devaluations are associated with a sharp contemporaneous increase of aggregate exports, Alessandria et al. (2015) and others show that aggregate exports increase gradually after large devaluations.==== Fig. 1 illustrates this observation for a sample of large devaluations over the period 1980 to 2013.====A potential explanation for the slow response of exports in large devaluations are balance sheet effects due to the prevalence of foreign-denominated debt in emerging economies.==== Given limited access to finance in these economies, large devaluations increase the domestic value of firms' debt burden, weakening their balance sheets and leading them to decrease investment and output. Moreover, recent studies also document the importance of these channels for the decisions of exporters at the firm-level.====In this paper we investigate the aggregate implications of financial frictions and balance-sheet effects on the dynamics of aggregate exports following large devaluations. To do so, we introduce financial frictions and foreign-denominated debt to a standard general equilibrium model of international trade with heterogeneous firms estimated to match salient features of the Mexican economy before the devaluation experienced in 1994. We use this novel framework to study the transitional dynamics of aggregate exports following a sequence of shocks estimated to resemble the Mexican large devaluation.====We find that financial frictions and balance-sheet effects account for a modest fraction of the dynamics of aggregate exports observed in the data despite their importance for the dynamics of aggregate output and investment. While financial frictions and balance-sheet effects indeed prevent firms from expanding output and investment, we find that financially-constrained exporters can nevertheless increase exports by reallocating sales across markets. We document evidence consistent with the importance of this channel using plant-level data from the Mexican devaluation in 1994 but we find that our model features too much reallocation relative to the data. In contrast, we show that the model can generate the gradual adjustment of exports observed in the data if we prevent firms from reallocating sales across markets.====To study the quantitative effects of large devaluations on export dynamics, we consider a small open economy populated by a large number of entrepreneurs who produce differentiated goods. Exporting is subject to fixed and variable trade costs, as in Melitz (2003), while entrepreneurs are heterogeneous with respect to productivity and variable trade costs.==== Finally, following the evidence discussed above, we introduce frictions in financial markets and foreign-denominated debt. In particular, we assume that entrepreneurs can borrow in domestic or foreign units up to a fraction of their physical capital stock at the time of repayment.====In our model, devaluations have opposing effects on firms' export decisions. On the one hand, exporting becomes more attractive, increasing the number of firms that export and the amount that they sell internationally. On the other hand, the change in the real exchange rate has negative balance-sheet effects on firms as it increases the domestic value of foreign-denominated debt, tightening the borrowing constraint and leading to a decrease in investment and output. Thus, our model captures the main consequences of large devaluations stressed by Frankel (2005) and others in earlier studies.====While credit constraints slow down the adjustment of output and investment, we show analytically that their effect on the dynamics of exports depends on the degree to which firms can reallocate sales across markets. In response to a real exchange rate change, firms that export a small fraction of their sales can increase their exports by changing the fraction of goods sold domestically and abroad, without increasing their total sales. In contrast, firms that export most of their output can increase exports only to the extent that they are able to expand total production.====We calibrate the model to match key moments of Mexican plant-level data for 1994 and use it to study the response to a sudden and unexpected increase of the real exchange rate caused by a deterministic sequence of shocks to aggregate productivity, interest rates, and the price of imported goods. Shocks are chosen to match the dynamics of the real exchange rate, investment, and real GDP observed in Mexico following the devaluation at the end of 1994.==== To determine the role played by financial frictions and foreign-denominated debt, we contrast the response of aggregate exports across two economies: (====) our baseline model with financial frictions and foreign-denominated debt and (====) an economy without financial frictions and with domestic-denominated debt.====We find that financial frictions and balance-sheet effects explain a modest share of the dynamics of exports observed in the data. In particular, these frictions reduce the average absolute percentage deviation between the exports elasticity implied by the frictionless model and the data by only 14%. We show that this result is driven by the reallocation channel: While indebted firms invest and produce less than firms with savings, exports increase regardless of firms' financial position because firms are able to reallocate sales across markets.====To examine the importance of intra-firm reallocation on aggregate export dynamics, we consider two counter-factual economies with alternative degrees of reallocation. First, we consider an economy in which exporters sell all of their output internationally, leaving no room for intra-firm reallocation. In this case, exports adjustment is gradual and close to the adjustment observed in the data. Second, we consider an economy in which exporters have homogeneous and low export intensity.==== In this case, aggregate exports feature a much faster adjustment to changes in the real exchange rate than in our baseline model and export dynamics look very close to the dynamics implied by its frictionless counterpart. These results show that the extent to which firms can reallocate sales across markets plays a key role in accounting for the dynamics of exports in large devaluations and suggest a role for reallocation frictions.====Finally, we provide evidence in support of the role of cross-market reallocation in export dynamics. To do so, we use plant-level data from Mexico's devaluation in 1994. We show that firms with lower initial export intensity, which are better able to reallocate sales across markets, featured a higher average growth of exports than those with high export intensity. This evidence is qualitatively consistent with the implications of our baseline model, suggesting that differences in the degree of intra-firm reallocation play an important role in export dynamics. We also show that, as in the model, exports growth in Mexico following the devaluation was largely driven by the intensive margin, which is consistent with the importance of intra-firm reallocation as a key driver of export adjustments.",Financial frictions and export dynamics in large devaluations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618303921,16 September 2019,2019,Research Article,212.0

Inter-group ==== between managers and workers increases, and intra-group inequality within the group of managers goes up as well. We show that for a given tax rate, there is an endogenous increase in the size of the welfare state that works against the increase in inequality, yet cannot offset it. The paper also sheds light on the conditions under which trade can actually lead to a Pareto improvement.","This paper looks at distributional effects of globalization in the presence of a welfare state redistributing income. Distributional effects of globalization are a topic hotly debated both by the general public and by academia.==== The recent academic literature suggests that trade leads to overall gains but also to a rise in income inequality.==== Scheve and Slaughter (2007) argue that this increase in inequality might lead to a protectionist drift in society and therefore ask for “a New Deal for globalization” that links globalization with redistribution policies. Accordingly it might be vital to accompany trade liberalization by redistribution policies, if we want the current level of economic integration to be politically sustainable. This paper aims to contribute to exactly this discussion.====To this end we construct a trade model of monopolistic competition with heterogeneous firms and occupational choice based on Egger and Kreickemeier (2012). A model with heterogeneity allows us to get a richer picture of distributional effects of globalization that would not be present in a model with homogeneous firms.==== The occupational choice mechanism is as in Lucas (1978): Individuals can work either as a manager or as a worker, and they are heterogeneous with respect to their managerial ability, while everybody is equally productive as a worker. Individuals observe their own managerial skill and choose whether to become a manager or a worker accordingly. The redistribution scheme is financed by a tax solely on managerial income. Since managers in our model are the high income group whereas workers are the low income group, this amounts to a parsimoniously modeled progressive income tax.==== The tax revenue is used to give the same absolute transfer payment to all individuals. We look at two aspects of income inequality within this framework, namely inter-group inequality between managers and workers and intra-group inequality within the group of managers. Inter-group inequality is calculated as average post tax-transfer managerial income compared to post tax-transfer labor income whereas intra-group inequality is given by the Gini coefficient for post tax-transfer managerial income. We consider trade between two symmetric countries. In particular, this also implies that the tax-transfer system is the same in the two countries. There are two types of costs involved with trade. Firstly, the standard iceberg transport cost and secondly, a fixed exporting cost. This fixed exporting cost leads to selection of only the most productive firms into exporting.====We show that the redistribution scheme affects occupational choice, leading to a decrease in the mass of managers and to an increase in the mass of workers. Both in the closed and in the open economy, there exists a trade-off between equality and efficiency: In either situation, the tax-transfer system leads to a more equal distribution of net incomes but also reduces aggregate income.==== We consider the transition from autarky to trade for a given tax rate, and we show that gains from trade exist due to the standard reallocation effect of labor towards more productive firms. Interestingly, gains from trade always materialize in this case despite the fact that the autarky equilibrium is not first best, and in the transition to the open economy the size of the welfare state increases, leading to larger per capita transfer payments. At the same time, and despite the presence of the redistribution scheme, inter-group inequality and intra-group inequality within the group of managers are higher in the open economy than under autarky. But we are able to show analytically that the tax-transfer system we consider is beneficial in making it more likely that not only the average income but all individual incomes rise in the transition from autarky to international trade.====This paper is related to various strands of the literature. It is linked to the literature that addresses distributional effects of globalization exploiting heterogeneity (see Yeaple, 2005; Egger and Kreickemeier, 2009a, Egger and Kreickemeier, 2012; Helpman et al., 2010). In particular, this paper contributes to the literature that exploits the link between globalization and top income inequality. Keller and Olney (2018) argue that globalization is an important driving force for the increase in top income inequality. This argument is also made in Gersbach and Schmutzler (2014). Using a matching model they show that globalization increases the heterogeneity of managerial compensation. Gabaix and Landier (2008) and Gabaix et al. (2014) contribute to the empirical literature that tries to explain CEO payments. They link changes in firms size to the increase in top income inequality.====This paper is also related to previous work on redistributing gains from trade. Dixit and Norman, 1980, Dixit and Norman, 1986 show the possibility of trade to be a Pareto improvement using redistribution policies that are not lump-sum. Spector (2001) questions the possibility to redistribute gains from trade. He argues that trade can lead to a loss in social welfare. The reason for this is as follows. In an open economy prices are determined on the world market. The government may therefore not be able to equalize equilibrium prices and wages through taxation. Naito (2006) also points to the possibility of social welfare losses.====So far there is surprisingly little research on the link between trade and inequality (exploiting heterogeneity) in the presence of a welfare state redistributing income. There are only few other papers on this topic, with a different focus though. Egger and Kreickemeier (2009b) integrate a distortionary tax-transfer system into a trade model with heterogeneous firms and fair-wages. They show that lower inequality than under autarky without sacrificing the gains from trade completely is possible if trade is accompanied by an increase in the profit tax rate. However, they focus on wage inequality and unemployment. Hence, it can be seen complementary to our analysis. Itskhoki (2008) discusses the optimal policy response to trade-induced inequality focusing on the equity-efficiency trade-off involved. Antràs et al. (2017) look at possibilities to redistribute the gains from trade when redistribution is costly. Yet, they cannot address inter-group inequality and intra-group inequality among the group of managers. Kohl (2017) analyzes the distributional effects of international trade in the presence of a redistribution scheme that is financed through a proportional income tax giving the same per capita transfer to all individuals. It is shown that this particular redistribution scheme is non-distortionary. In such a framework it is always possible to decrease trade-induced inequality without jeopardizing the gains from trade. This is different as soon as we look at the more realistic case of a progressive income tax which we discuss in this contribution.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we derive the closed economy equilibrium. In Section 3 we look at the open economy equilibrium. In particular, we discuss how trade affects the factor allocation, welfare, the size of the welfare state and the income distribution in the economy. Section 4 concludes by summarizing the most important results.","Redistribution, selection, and trade",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300790,5 September 2019,2019,Research Article,213.0

This paper scrutinizes the effects of ISDS and national treatment provisions in a two-period model where foreign investment is subject to a hold-up problem. It shows that ISDS may increase welfare, but comes with additional regulatory distortions in the first period. A national treatment provision avoids these regulatory distortions, but implies entry distortions because it makes the hold-up problem also apply to domestic firms. If the domestic regulatory framework applies to many domestic firms, a national treatment provision welfare-dominates ISDS.","International investment agreements often include investor protection provisions such as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanisms. These provisions are supposed to protect a foreign investor against a government that cares about the well-being of all national actors, but does not take foreign investor profit into account. The issue has gained a high level of public attention, in particular through controversy over whether these provisions should be part of future multilateral trade and investment agreements. ISDS provisions are rather universal; already in 2012 ISDS provisions were present in as many as 93%, or some 3000 international investment agreements (see OECD, 2012). Existing and proposed ISDS mechanisms follow procedures separate from the host country's legal system, mostly relying on ad hoc panels that decide on monetary compensations of foreign investors for increases in costs, or reductions in revenues, that are caused by “unjustified” government regulation.==== According to UNCTAD, known treaty-based arbitrations amount to 942 cases of which 602 have been concluded. Of the concluded cases, 35.7% were won by states, 28.7% were won by investors, and the remainder was either settled, discontinued or decided in favor of neither party. Of 164 cases won by investors, more than USD 10 (100) million were awarded in 110 (43) cases. The number of initiated arbitrations has experienced some variation in the last years, with a low of 68 in 2013 and a high of 83 in 2015.====Why should foreign investors enjoy a treatment that is denied to domestic investors? Any long-term investment, domestic and foreign, is subject to the risk of future government policies endangering ==== profitability of the investment. But there is a crucial difference: when deciding on its policies, the government will take into account the effects on domestic investor profits, whereas the same is not true for foreign investor profit. While host country governments typically have an interest in foreign investment, due to some positive spillover, they will ignore the impact of a more stringent regulation on foreign investors' profits once the investment is made. Since governments are sovereign, ==== enforceable contracts on regulatory behavior are infeasible. As a result, beneficial investments may not be carried out at all, or not carried out to the socially optimal extent.====We prefer so see this as an instance of the so-called ====. A hold-up problem arises whenever a relationship between two parties is characterized by the following conditions: (i) At least one of the two parties may undertake a costly investment that benefits the outcome of the relationship. (ii) The return to that investment if used within the relationship is larger than if used outside the relationship (relationship-specificity). (iii) The two parties cannot enter an ==== enforceable contract on the investment, say due to ==== non-verifiability by a third party (see Che and Sákovics, 2008). The literature typically discusses hold-up problems arising in private relationships.==== In our case the relationship is between foreign investors and the host country government which benefits from foreign investment through some spill-over to the domestic economy. A hold-up problem arises because – once investors have entered – their investment is virtually locked in and cannot be undone or relocated to some other country. Furthermore, the government's regulatory policy, which must be seen as its contribution to the relationship, is not contractible prior to investor entry and cannot be part of a credible commitment to some policy rule. Anticipating a regulatory policy that ignores their interest, foreign investors will enter to a sub-optimally low extent. This is analogous to anticipating the outcome of ==== Nash bargaining between private parties, which similarly dilutes the investor interest in the hold-up relationships between private parties. Obviously, the hold-up remedies usually suggested for relationships between private parties (e.g., vertical integration, residual property rights) are infeasible with investor-state relationships. Hence the desire to achieve some efficiency increase through ==== ISDS provisions aiming at compensation. This is similar to tax holidays for foreign investors (see e.g. Bond and Samuelson, 1986), but ISDS compensations are paid ==== while tax holidays are granted ==== in order to front-load the benefits of foreign entry.====Sub-optimal levels of foreign investment have also been discussed in models allowing for ==== expropriation by host-country governments, starting with the pioneering contribution by Eaton and Gersovitz (1984). There is a clear analogy in that eroding an investment's ==== profitability through national interest policies would seem economically equivalent to partial expropriation. Indeed, the ISDS provisions in existing agreements make explicit reference to “measures equivalent to expropriations” (see below). However, we argue that the economics of ISDS is best understood as an attempted remedy of a hold-up problem. That being said, however, it is interesting to note that in Eaton and Gersovitz (1984) a penalty imposed on expropriation may benefit the expropriating country. In our case, too, an ISDS provision potentially penalizing the host country will under certain conditions benefit the host country.====It is often argued that any anticipation of ISDS prompts the government to soften its regulatory stance (“regulatory chill”). However, a change in the government's regulatory behavior is the very objective of ISDS in the first place. The question is whether this change in behavior increases efficiency. Moreover, under plausible conditions an ISDS mechanism triggers an intertemporal trade-off. A lenient present standard may attract FDI, but it also increases the odds that the government will want to increase its regulatory stringency in the future. If increasing regulatory stringency entails ISDS-imposed compensation payments, then a lower present regulatory standard increases the expected cost of adjusting the standard in the future. Conversely, imposing a more stringent regulatory standard may reduce the present inflow of FDI, but it will give the government more discretion in the future, without facing a compensation threat.====It is this intertemporal trade-off that we analyze in the first part of this paper. We develop a two-period model that highlights this trade-off and allows us to identify conditions under which ISDS does indeed mitigate the hold-up problem vis à vis foreign investors. Within each period, a more stringent regulation delivers welfare gains (say less pollution), but it also causes a welfare loss because FDI generates a positive spillover to the domestic economy, and more stringent regulation reduces FDI. We allow for an FDI entry subsidy as a second policy instrument which the government may use to influence the level of foreign investment in period one. As we shall see, the government will overregulate in period two, causing suboptimally low entry despite the entry subsidy. An ISDS mechanism puts period two regulation under a liability rule, which makes the government (partly) internalize foreign investors' profits and which potentially improves efficiency. However, due to the aforementioned intertemporal trade-off it also affects period one regulation. We show that ISDS distorts first-period regulation and reduces overregulation in the second period, and we characterize the conditions under which ISDS is welfare-improving.====We then compare ISDS with a national treatment provision. National treatment means that the government is not allowed to discriminate between domestic and foreign firms. This seems like a natural way of forcing the government to take into account foreign investors' profits, since any regulation will always impact domestic and foreign firms on an equal footing. However, it introduces a new distortion, having to do with entry of foreign firms. The government now deals with a mix of domestic and foreign firms, and the share of domestic firms becomes pivotal. The presence of a hold-up problem vis à vis foreign firms inflicts a damage on domestic firms who are, in effect, taken hostage to this problem through the national treatment provision. For a given number of domestic firms, this damage is the larger, the larger the number of foreign firms. Anticipating this effect, the government wants to discourage entry so as to keep the share of foreign firms small. However, if the number of domestic firms is sufficiently large, this effect will be small to begin with, and we show that a national treatment provision welfare-dominates ISDS if the number of domestic firms is not too small and an increase in this number reduces the hold-up incentive. These conditions are more likely to be fulfilled if the regulatory framework is not firm- or industry-specific, and thus the role a national treatment provision can play for fixing the hold-up problem crucially depends on the regulatory design.====Most of the literature on ISDS is empirical and offers little guidance on the trade-offs implied by different investor protection mechanisms. This literature regards investor protection provisions as a means of attracting FDI, in particular for developing countries where institutional investor protection might be underdeveloped,==== and thus it shares some features with the literature on tax competition.==== Our focus here is not on competition for FDI, but on the welfare implications of different forms of investor protection. The reason is twofold: First, we want to keep the model as simple as possible to start with, and thus we do not consider strategic interactions among countries or among firms. Second, investor protection provisions, particularly ISDS, have been hotly debated in countries negotiating trade deals like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and the US, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) between the US and 11 other pacific countries. While negotiations for both agreements have been abandoned by the US, TPP is now considered a blueprint for future agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.==== In this type of agreement, investor protection can no longer be used strategically for attracting FDI as it affects all signatory countries.====Theoretical papers have a different focus. Janeba (2019) deals with the regulatory chill effect of ISDS and finds – as we do – that this effect is ambiguous. Horn and Tangerås (2017) explore the efficiency properties of compensatory schemes in an environment where regulation means effectively shutting down production from FDI. Examining strategic interactions between regulators and/or firms, Konrad (2017) shows that the existence of large investors may lead to overinvestment and excessively permissive regulation. Schjelderup and Stähler (2019) show why multinational firms have an interest in ISDS provisions beyond potential compensation as it allows them to be more aggressive on markets. Closer to our paper is Aisbett et al. (2010a) who discuss the role of compensations if regulation makes a foreign investment worthless. In their framework, a court may decide in favor of compensations the higher the ==== probability of harm caused by the investment. In our model, regulation reduces, but does not necessarily eliminate investor profit.==== Our paper is also related to the literature on inter-governmental dispute settlement under the auspices of the WTO and its effects on firm behavior.==== The difference is that we focus on dispute settlement between private investors and the government in the specific context of regulatory standards pertaining to investment projects. We are concerned with the incentive problems deriving from asymmetric information and incomplete contracts between foreign investors and the host country government in cases where investors are locked in after entry, and we explore the efficiency properties of ISDS and national treatment mechanisms that are commonly proposed as potential solutions to these problems.====There is also a literature on the formation and the impact of international investment agreements. One strand of this literature has explored which type of countries are more likely to sign bilateral investment treaties (BITs). For example, Bergstrand and Egger (2013) consider the co-existence of BITs and PTAs (preferential trade agreements) and show that the likelihood of both a BIT and a PTA is higher between two countries with larger and more similar GDP, but that an increase in relative factor endowments decreases the likelihood of a BIT, while making a PTA more likely. The other strand of the literature has investigated whether BITs increase FDI. For example, Egger and Merlo (2012) show for German multinationals that BITs increase both the number of multinational firms and the number of plants per firm. However, measuring regulatory stringency by the presence of ISDS provisions, Berger et al. (2011) show that more stringent BITs do not necessarily lead to more FDI.====We wish to highlight right from the start that our modeling framework stacks the deck in favor of ISDS because our model cannot address a number of problems associated with ISDS. First, we ignore all procedural and legal costs associated with ISDS, which can be substantial.==== Second, we take the ownership structure of firms as given (distinguishing only domestic and foreign firms) and do not allow for strategic ownership changes in response to ISDS, although we discuss some aspects of this issue at the end of Section 3. Third, we do not take into account that an ISDS panel may rule on its own, may not follow best practice procedures when appointing its members, and may face little or no control by law-makers in the signatory countries.==== This setup may violate the Rule of Law in several countries, creating an economic “Guantanamo Bay”, and the costs of by-passing legal procedures will not be easy to assess, but could be substantial.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the basic model and develops the outcome without any ISDS provision. Section 3 extends this model to the case of ISDS and develops the regulatory regime in the presence of ISDS, and our modeling of the ISDS provision will follow closely the details of investment agreements, for example the TPP draft. Section 4 discusses a national treatment provision and compares it to an ISDS provision.

If the country exits the currency union, it may redenominate its liabilities and reduce the real value of debt through depreciation and ====. We analyze formally how the anticipation of this possibility, “exit expectations”, impact the dynamics of the sovereign debt crisis. First, we show that public debt accumulates faster and sovereign yields increase more strongly because of redenomination risk. Second, we find that exit expectations induce public debt to be stagflationary. Last, we analyze Greek time-series data through the lens of our model and quantify the contribution of exit expectations to the Greek crisis.","An individual country within a currency union has limited control over inflation. Public debt, even if issued in nominal terms, is effectively real for such a country because the real value of public debt cannot be reduced unilaterally through inflation (Aguiar et al., 2013; De Grauwe, 2011). By exiting the currency union and introducing a new currency, governments regain control of inflation: debt becomes nominal—provided it is issued under domestic law and can be redenominated by fiat. For this reason, expectations of an exit from a currency union may arise in the context of a sovereign debt crisis.====The recent crisis in the euro area is a case in point. Fig. 1 shows for the period 2009–2011 the probability of a sovereign default in Greece (dashed line) as implied by the price of credit default swap (CDS) spreads, jointly with the probability that a country exits the euro area before end-2014, as implied by the price of a bet offered by the online betting platform “intrade” (solid line).==== Here we focus on the period from October 2009, after a newly elected Greek government revealed that the budget deficit was about twice as large as previously expected, until December 2011, that is, before actual default took place.====These developments suggest that the monetary/fiscal regime in place as well as the probability of its demise and the options in the event of its demise are paramount for understanding economic outcomes in times of duress. Against this background, we take the perspective of a small member state of a currency union and ask how the possibility of an exit from the union impacts a sovereign debt crisis. We build a model of a small open economy which is (initially) operating within a currency union. We assume that the country experiences a sovereign debt crisis, as public debt is on an ever-rising, non sustainable trajectory. The crisis can be resolved via a fiscal reform, by outright default, or via an exit from the currency union. Exit from the union is inflationary, because the health of public finances is restored through currency depreciation.====Formally, we specify “simple rules” for monetary and fiscal policy as in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007), and let a Markov chain determine policy changes in a way consistent with agents' expectations. Initially, fiscal policy is “active”, as taxes do not systematically adjust to stabilize public debt. Because the country lacks monetary autonomy, public debt is on an explosive trajectory. Equilibrium default can restore public finances, as in the “fiscal theory of sovereign risk” (Uribe, 2006). As an alternative, the country may exit the union and adopt a “passive” monetary policy which accommodates the active fiscal policy. In this case, the price level and the exchange rate after exit are determined by the need to align the real value of public debt and future primary surpluses—an instance of the “fiscal theory of the price level” (Leeper, 1991; Sims, 2013; Woodford, 1995).====Our methodological contribution is to introduce regime change in a New Keynesian model of a small open economy à la Galí and Monacelli (2005), which we extend to allow for dynamics of public debt. While New Keynesian models are frequently used to study the properties of alternative exchange rate regimes, the possibility of exchange-rate-regime change as part of the equilibrium process and the expectation thereof are commonly ignored, even though policy regime changes have been analyzed in other contexts (Bianchi, 2013; Davig and Leeper, 2007a).==== Our analysis is focused on a situation where the country still operates within the currency union, but is subject to spillovers from the events after exit. In this regard, we follow the closed-economy analysis of Bianchi and Melosi (2017).====Because regime change is exogenous in our model, we maintain a high degree of tractability which allows us to derive our main results analytically. Our first result is that, even though active fiscal policy and currency union membership is not sustainable in the long run, this policy mix may be sustained in equilibrium if the probability of regime change is sufficiently large. Yet exit expectations alter the dynamics of the debt crisis because investors anticipate losses due to depreciation and ask for higher yields prior to exit. Consequently, the refinancing costs of the government rise and the debt crisis is reinforced—as losses are proportional to outstanding debt, yields rise in sync with the debt level. In this respect, exit expectations are no different from expectations of outright sovereign default.====Our second result is that if public debt is high, exit expectations drive up interest rates for the sovereign, but also for private borrowers. This is because nominal depreciation after exit affects ==== assets denominated in the (new) domestic currency, not only public debt. This, in turn, has adverse effects on economic activity if prices adjust sluggishly. Moreover, inflation rises already (somewhat) before the exit takes place, due to forward-looking price-setting behavior by firms. As a result, competitiveness deteriorates and economic activity declines further. Hence, the adverse effect of exit expectations is not limited to public finances. It is felt in the economy at large: in the presence of exit expectations, public debt has a ==== effect on the economy. Instead, if exit is ruled out, public debt is neutral for the economy in our baseline model. In this respect, exit expectations differ fundamentally from expectations of outright sovereign default.====In a last step, we confront our model with Greek time-series data and estimate the realizations of the model's hidden states with a regime-switching Kalman filter. In the process we obtain estimates for the probability that a specific regime has been in place at a particular point in time. Overall we obtain estimates which appear quite plausible. For instance, we find a shift towards active fiscal policy is likely to have taken place around early 2010 and to have been reversed not before late 2015. We also compute counterfactual outcomes and find that exit expectations made a sizable contribution to the build-up of Greek sovereign debt through their impact on yields. Moreover, during the period 2010–2015, they slowed down the adjustment of the real exchange rate and caused an average output loss of some 4%.====Our finding that a policy mix of active fiscal policy and active monetary policy can give rise to stagflationary dynamics is not new. Bianchi and Ilut (2017) show that such a regime can account for the failure to reduce US inflation during the 1970s. In a more recent paper, Bianchi and Melosi (2019) model the lack of coordination between monetary and fiscal policy in a closed economy as an active-active regime and also obtain stagflationary dynamics. We show that this result carries over to an open-economy framework and highlight the pivotal role of the exchange rate regime. Benigno et al. (2007) establish that monetary policy can peg the exchange rate and achieve equilibrium determinacy via a simple instrument rule according to which interest rates respond to deviations of the exchange rate from target. In this sense monetary policy is active under a fixed exchange rate regime and hence unable to accommodate an active fiscal policy. The same holds in our model of a currency union. Here, we model membership in a currency union through a “targeting rule”, fixing the exchange rate at unity. Effectively this implies an extremely large response of the interest rate to potential movements in the nominal exchange rate.====In our analysis, we consider outright default and exit as alternative outcomes of a sovereign debt crisis in a currency union. Yet, debt repudiation and devaluation often occur jointly (Reinhart, 2002). Na et al. (2018) rationalize this observation in a model where default and exchange rates are determined optimally. Central to their analysis is the assumption that governments are indebted in foreign currency, the “original sin” of many emerging market economies. As a result, inflation and devaluation are ineffective in reducing the real value of debt. In our analysis, instead, public debt is governed by domestic law, in line with actual practice in the euro area (Chamon et al., 2018), and may be redenominated upon exit.====Our model does not permit self-fulfilling exit as in the stylized models of Drazen and Masson (1994) and Obstfeld (1996), because we assume exogenous transition probabilities. We also abstract from contagion of exit across members states of a currency union, a possibility which is explored in Eijffinger et al. (2018). Instead, we study the impact of a non-sustainable fiscal/monetary policy mix within a regime-switching open economy model.====Our findings reiterate a theme which features prominently in classic studies of the stability of currency pegs, namely that a non-sustainable policy mix can be maintained only for a limited number of periods (Flood and Garber, 1984; Krugman, 1979). Also, our analysis reestablishes two results of earlier work on currency crises, namely that expected devaluation may raise the refinancing cost of governments, as well as induce a loss in competitiveness due to forward-looking price setting behavior (Obstfeld, 1994, Obstfeld, 1997).====Lastly, our paper relates to work which accounts for important aspects of the recent euro-area crisis. Studies with a focus on outright sovereign default include Bi (2012), Daniel and Shiamptanis (2012) and Lorenzoni and Werning (2019), among others. In an influential empirical study Krishnamurthy et al. (2017) decompose yield spreads into a redenomination and a default premium. Gilchrist et al. (2018), Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) and Kuvshinov et al. (2016) analyze the sluggish adjustment of real exchange rates in the euro area.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

The distinguishing features of these crisis are large output drops, sudden and sizable current account reversals and real exchange rate depreciation that has usually been followed by a slow recovery, i.e. a highly asymmetric dynamic where the crisis unravels quickly affecting financial and real variables, with sluggish recovery.====Even though understanding these dynamics has been of first order importance, they have proven to be hard to capture with standard open economy models. A promising line of research has been developed by Bianchi (2011) following the seminal work of Mendoza (2002) by modeling a small open economy subject to collateral constraints with endogenous borrowing limits.==== However, these models that are the building blocks of models currently used to study macro-prudential policies, have not been able to generate the observed persistence and sluggishness in the recovery after the crisis. This lack of persistence in the recovery after a Sudden Stop can be observed in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2017) and in Bianchi et al. (2016) for the case of a model with news shocks.====In this paper, we extend the standard models with endogenous collateral constraints to include trend shocks and contribute to the literature in two ways. First, we study the role of permanent income shocks in generating Sudden Stops in a model where the collateral constraint depends on the tradable value of domestic income. Second, we review optimal tax policy implications for economies with trend shocks.====We find that transitory shocks alone can generate a sizable depreciation of the real exchange rate but imply counterfactual persistence in the real exchange rate and the trade balance-to-output ratio. On the other hand, permanent income shocks can be relevant factors as they produce plausible Sudden Stop dynamics. To study this, we extend the model with stationary output shocks to include both transitory and trend shocks as in Aguiar and Gopinath (2006).==== We estimate the trend and transitory shocks using Argentinean data from 1876 to 2004, and we feed the estimated parameters into the model to simulate Sudden Stops as defined in the data. We find that the model with trend shocks produces realistic Sudden Stop dynamics. This positive result is in line with Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) and Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) who highlight the importance of trend shocks in generating the observed business cycle dynamics in emerging economies. In a way, our paper complements theirs by focusing on a two-sector economy with occasionally binding collateral constraints.====Our positive finding is not only important from a quantitative point of view. It has significant economic implications in the way we understand this type of crisis as trend and transitory shocks generate very different debt dynamics in small open economy models. The intuition for these differences comes from the Permanent Income Hypothesis that suggests that a negative transitory shock increases debt to smooth consumption, while a negative trend shock leads to a permanent fall in consumption. Consequently, the trend shock model exhibits a deleveraging effect after the Sudden Stop that happens because the household recognizes itself as permanently poorer. This is in contrast with the deleveraging in the model only with transitory shocks, which instead arises due to hitting the borrowing constraint tightened by the low output level.====Besides looking at unconditional moments and the dynamics around Sudden Stops, we test our model in a key dimension. As a by-product of our estimation strategy we can recover the estimates of transitory tradable and non-tradable income shocks and a common trend shock. If Sudden Stops were triggered by transitory shocks, we should observe a sequence of negative transitory shocks before these events. This is not the case in the data. Instead, we find mixed evidence on this dimension and, in general, persistent drops in income do not precede Sudden Stops. On the other hand, we find that the economy is growing in the years prior to Sudden Stops and, every Sudden Stop in our sample is preceded by a large negative trend shock, more than two standard deviations below average in most of the cases, suggesting that Sudden Stop dynamics are mainly driven by permanent shocks.====We find that the trend shocks model can generate overborrowing compared to the constrained efficient economy, in line with the findings of Bianchi (2011), in the sense that the competitive equilibrium exhibits larger levels of debt than the constrained planner's solution. However, as opposed to Bianchi (2011), considering trend shocks introduces a new aspect of overborrowing. In the model with only mean reverting shocks the economy tends to suffer more overborrowing during bad times, i.e. when the economy issues debt to smooth consumption. Meanwhile, with trend shocks households tend to issue debt in good times to increase consumption today on behalf of future higher income and tend to overborrow largely during good times too.====We then study optimal taxation on external borrowing. In line with the existing literature, i.e. Bianchi (2011), Benigno et al. (2016) and others, we also find that capital controls are macroprudential, in the sense that they are positive on average. We find that trend shocks imply higher degree of macroprudential policy as it implies consistently higher average taxes, both in good and bad times, than with only transitory shocks. Additionally, in line with Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2017) we find that they are also procyclical, meaning a high (low) tax on foreign debt issuance when output growth is low (high), i.e. consistent with what the authors refer to as the second dimension of macroprudentiality. However, complementing the results in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2017), a simple accounting exercise shows that the degree of procyclicality is lower with trend shocks than with transitory shocks. This is because with trend shocks, the planner issues less debt than the households during the booming part of the cycle.====In order to put the contribution of our paper further in context, we turn to a more detailed review of the existing literature.",Trend shocks and sudden stops,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300765,26 August 2019,2019,Research Article,222.0

Consistent with the model, we find that a decrease in tariffs on the target ","How do firms organize their production? Is it through market (outsourcing) or within firms (vertical integration)? This is a classic question in economics. This important question has also been asked in the field of international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). How do firms organize their production ====, through market or within firms (FDI)? On the one hand, the advancement of information and communication technology has changed the incentives for vertical integration. On the other hand, the decrease in transportation costs and reduction in trade barriers have altered firms' decisions on allocating their production across national boundaries. Theories of firm boundaries have been introduced to address this issue. Most studies in this trade-FDI-organization literature focus on the effects of globalization on multinational corporations' (MNCs) decisions on offshoring and global vertical integration.==== In contrast to that focus, the present paper explores how globalization affects outsourcing and vertical integration ==== a country's boundary, that is, by ==== firms, as opposed to MNCs. The empirical analysis of the paper helps address the concern of Acemoglu et al. (2010, p889) who conclude that “[d]espite a large theoretical literature on the determinants of vertical integration, the economics profession is far from a consensus on the empirical determinants of vertical integration in general.”====By definition, every vertical integration involves an upstream firm and a downstream firm. Every vertical integration executed via an acquisition has a target firm and an acquiring firm. In this study, we examine the effects of trade liberalization in the upstream industry on domestic ==== vertical integration, in which a domestic upstream firm is acquired by a domestic downstream firm.==== We consider two types of tariff reductions. One is related to tariffs on the inputs that the target uses in its production, which we refer to as ====. The other type relates to tariffs on the output of the target, which we refer to as ====. We investigate how a cut in input tariffs and a cut in output tariffs affect the incentive of backward vertical integration, respectively.====We first propose a theoretical model to guide and provide insights to our empirical work. In the model, a domestic firm in the upstream industry makes relationship-specific investment that increases the value of the final product. Underinvestment is a typical outcome in this situation. Vertical integration helps solve the underinvestment problem but the benefit of vertical integration is affected by the outside option, which comes from the import of the upstream products. The analysis shows that when there is a reduction of output tariff in the upstream industry, the downstream firm benefits more from substituting its supplier with imported input, which makes vertical integration relatively less attractive. In contrast, an input tariff reduction in the upstream industry amplifies the benefits from vertical integration.====We take China's accession to the World Trade Organizationthe (WTO) as a quasi-natural experiment for trade liberalization to examine its effects on vertical integrations. This approach has two advantages. First, China implemented drastic trade liberalization when it was accepted as a member of the WTO in 2001. The timing of China's accession to the WTO is commonly viewed as a shock. Second, reorganization of firms ==== China has become very active since the end of the last century. Fig. 1 plots the time trends of three types of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) related with China. During 1998–2014, a total of 18,220 M&As involving Chinese firms were completed. Among those, 67.9% or 12,371, are pure domestic M&As. The total value of all reported transactions is USD 741.2 billion and that of domestic M&As is USD 411.4 billion, accounting for 55.5% of the total value.==== As Fig. 1 shows, domestic M&As experience a sharp increase after 2001, while the increases of cross-border M&As are less significant.====We conduct our empirical analysis based on data from 1998 to 2007, with China's WTO entry around the middle of the period. We observe a large variation in tariff reductions across industries after the WTO entry, which allows us to employ the difference-in-differences (DID) method in our analysis. Our empirical results are consistent with the model prediction: output tariff liberalization ==== the number of (domestic backward) vertical integrations, while input tariff liberalization ==== it. The findings are obtained based on our main regression model in which we control for a set of industry-level characteristics including the average age of firms, total size, degree of market competition, and time-varying international shocks. The findings are robust to various specifications of the empirical model and measurements of variables.====Although considerable empirical literature on the determination of vertical integration exists, empirical studies on the effects of tariffs on vertical integration are relatively new and still scant. As pointed out by Ornelas and Turner (2012, p31), “====”. The present paper contributes to this part of the literature, which includes Alfaro et al. (2016) as the only existing study, to the best of our knowledge.==== Alfaro et al. (2016) build a simple model in which vertical integration increases productivity but is costly. Their model predicts that higher prices of final goods (the ==== firms' output) will make the upstream and downstream firms benefit more from vertical integration. They utilize tariff reductions as an exogenous shock to prices and use cross country data in their empirical analysis to test their theoretical prediction. Unlike (or as a complement to) Alfaro et al. (2016), we examine the effects on vertical integration by changes in the ==== industry's input and output tariffs. Moreover, our empirical findings can be explained using a model of relationship-specific investment and trade, which is built based on Ornelas and Turner, 2008, Ornelas and Turner, 2012.====Our paper is also related to existing studies on firm-level adjustments and performances in response to trade liberalization. Firm-level adjustments have many dimensions, including employment (Autor et al., 2013), total factor productivity (TFP) (Topalova and Khandelwal, 2011), quality upgrading (Amiti and Khandelwal, 2013), growth (Baldwin and Gu, 2009), innovation and R&D (Bloom et al., 2016; Liu and Qiu, 2016), product scope (Qiu and Zhou, 2013), and product mix (Mayer et al., 2014). These types of adjustments are ==== adjustments. Our paper is about ==== adjustment (outsourcing or vertical integration), and hence, is also related to the literature reviewed by Antras (2016).====Some recent studies emphasize the importance of liberalization in intermediate input tariffs, as opposed to output tariffs. Those studies focus on the effects of intermediate input tariff reductions on firm productivity (Amiti and Konings, 2007), product scope (Goldberg et al., 2010), product quality (Fernandes and Paunov, 2013), and innovation (Liu and Qiu, 2016). Our paper adds a new dimension to this list: intermediate input tariff reductions affect domestic firms' organizational choice.====The paper is organized as follows.

In this context, crises are characterized by long periods with positive shocks that eventually revert, rendering the collateral constraint binding and triggering deleveraging. In this environment it is optimal to tax borrowing during good times, and let agents act freely leaving the allocations undistorted, including borrowing and lending, when the economy reverts to a bad state. We contrast our findings to the case of standard shocks to the level of income, where it is optimal to tax debt in bad times, when agents need to borrow the most for ","A large literature has examined the consequences of systemic externalities with endogenous borrowing constraints, and the optimal policy to prevent “over-borrowing”. But, as Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2017) have highlighted, all these models share one unappealing feature: when the economy is subject to temporary income shocks, households over-borrow in bad times resulting in counter-cyclical macroprudential policy, so that regulation is looser in booms and tighter in recessions. This result is at odds with standard views on the cyclicality of macroprudential policy, calling for pro-cyclical taxes to curb over-borrowing in booms.==== In this paper we show that the assumption of a stationary income process is crucial to obtain this result. By introducing a trend to the endowment and focusing on shocks to its growth rate, we show that both the timing and size of the optimal policy is affected.====To do so, we analyze a benchmark model that allows us to assess the optimal macroprudential regulation in the presence of shocks to the trend of income. We build upon the work by Bianchi (Bianchi, 2011), in which a systemic externality sets the stage for the analysis of constrained optimal (Ramsey) policy. In a nutshell, the model is a standard small open economy, where a continuum of identical agents must decide how to allocate their income to consume a tradable and a non-tradable good. The agents can move income through time using a one period non-state contingent financial asset measured in units of the tradable good. Importantly, agents are constrained on how negative (in debt) they can be. They can borrow only up to a fraction of the value of their endowments: they are collateral constrained. This constraint is important because the agents' income (endowment) is subject to random shocks. We show that the nature of the shock is a key determinant of the underlying reason to borrow, and therefore has very important implications for regulation.====To see this, consider first the cyclical implications of the Bianchi (Bianchi, 2011) benchmark. There the endowments follow a persistent, but stationary, stochastic process affecting their level (henceforth, “level shocks”). In this case, after a negative shock, and in order to smooth consumption, agents dig into their savings anticipating that the endowment will (mean-) revert in the future. Thus, agents borrow in bad times and save in good times. Because markets are incomplete, the individual borrowing cost does not fully internalize the social cost of debt. This implies that the regulator needs to tax borrowing strongly in bad times, in order to make agents internalize the systemic risk implied by their borrowing decisions.====In contrast, consider the environment with shocks to the growth rate rather than to the level. Now, a negative shock not only affects the whole stream of current and future income, but, if the shock is persistent, it also signals that the future could be even worse. Thus, agents drastically reduce their consumption and increase their savings to insure against it: agents save in bad times. In this case, the incentives of the agents and the planner are aligned. A positive shock has the opposite effect: when it happens agents receive more income, but they also believe that the future will be even brighter and sharply increase their borrowing to bring resources from the future to the present. Crucially, when each individual is riding this wave of “optimism”, they do not internalize that when the process eventually reverts the large level of accumulated debt will affect everyone in the economy by tightening the collateral constraint. Again, because markets are incomplete, a social planner who wants to align the private and social incentives to borrow would tax (or regulate more) in good times. To sum up, we establish that under persistent trend shocks macroprudential policy is pro-cyclical, whereas under level shocks macroprudential policy is counter-cyclical.====Our results underline the importance of singling out the right motive for debt accumulation in order to analyze macroprudential policy. But, do agents borrow in good or in bad times? There is ample evidence in the literature that shocks providing information about the future state of the economy are an important source of business cycle fluctuations (e.g. Beaudry and Portier (Beaudry and Portier, 2006) and Jaimovich and Rebelo (Jaimovich and Rebelo, 2009)). A related point was made in the context of developing countries by Aguiar and Gopinath (Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007), stressing the permanent income channel to explain the counter-cyclical behavior of the current account using trend shocks. In sum, a large body of work points towards the possibility that, in several contexts, agents may borrow in good times rather than in bad times.====As an illustration, the view that agents borrow in good times is supported by Fig. 1, which shows the annual growth rates of GDP and household debt for Argentina over the period 1995–2017.==== The two series in the plot exhibit a clear positive relationship. In order to capture this feature in our model, we use a tractable way of modeling the idea that growth today is usually followed by growth in the future, leading to higher long-run income. Using an identification approach developed in Blanchard et al. (Blanchard et al., 2013), we establish this is an accurate representation of GDP dynamics for the Argentinian economy and that the persistence of the growth rate is around 0.79. This allows for current growth to signal future growth in expectation. A forward-looking consumer thus will optimally increase his current consumption in good times, leading to debt accumulation.====The high persistence in the permanent component connects our paper closely to the large literature on news shocks, which broadly posits that advance information about future income plays a sizable role in business cycle dynamics.==== The literature has employed different approaches to model news shocks. Pioneered by Beaudry and Portier (Beaudry and Portier, 2006), and followed by the important work of Jaimovich and Rebelo (Jaimovich and Rebelo, 2009), Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2012), and others, one approach is to model news as perfect signals about future TFP shocks. Another approach, employed by Blanchard et al. (Blanchard et al., 2013), Barsky and Sims (Barsky and Sims, 2012), and Cao and L'Huillier (Cao and L'Huillier, 2018), among others, models advance information with signals about persistent permanent shocks.==== In this sense our process has a “news component” reminiscent of news shocks. Therefore, to emphasize the role played by the news component, in what follows we will refer to it as growth shocks, trend shocks and the news economy, interchangeably. Noting that we always refer to the same object: a sufficiently persistent growth shock.====We also estimate the stationary component of Argentinian GDP and use it in what we call the “level shocks” economy as a benchmark to compare our results. To minimize departures from the literature, we calibrate the benchmark economy using exactly the same parameters as Bianchi (Bianchi, 2011). Since with the same parameterization the trend economy generates a higher crisis frequency, we adjust the discount factor, while keeping all other parameters constant, to obtain the same frequency of crisis in both economies. Our main findings are 1) as anticipated by our previous intuition, the optimal tax on debt is highly pro-cyclical, while it is highly counter-cyclical in the level shocks economy, and 2) the level of taxation is around one-tenth of that in the level shocks economy.====To understand these results it is important to keep in mind that the agents and the planner in the trend (news) shocks economy are a great deal more patient. This is because to achieve the same crisis probability, the level shocks economy requires a high degree of impatience on the part of households (==== = .91) to incentivize borrowing and overcome the precautionary savings motive.==== Since agents have a strong incentive to borrow against the future when a positive shock arrives, the news economy can achieve the same crisis probability and a similar level of indebtedness with a standard, higher value for the discount factor (==== = .95). Thus, in principle, since the optimal tax on debt is forward-looking, the tax in the news economy should be higher, not lower. However, a lower shadow value of borrowing when a crisis occurs introduces an opposing force leading to lower taxes. In the trend shocks economy, crises occur after a succession of positive shocks revert to negative shocks. With trend shocks agents do not want to borrow, but to save in response to a negative shock since negative trend growth today implies a lower future endowment and a stronger desire to keep resources in the future, rather than bringing them to the present. By saving in bad times, agents move away from the constraint rather than towards it, and thus private and social incentives are better aligned. In addition, even though the constraint could bind in the future under some realizations of the shock, the shadow value of an extra unit of debt is smaller because agents have less desire to borrow. All in all, the optimal tax on borrowing is drastically reduced in the economy with persistent trend shocks compared to the economy with only level shocks.====Another important difference between level and trend shocks regards the frequency of optimal debt taxation. With trend shocks, our economy features an unconditional probability of strictly positive taxation of 62%, whereas this probability is 88% in the level shocks case. Thus, the persistent trend shocks view of the household dynamics of debt assigns a different role to macroprudential policy in which it should be used much less often.",Macro-prudential taxation in good times,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300698,14 August 2019,2019,Research Article,224.0

RoOs exist to avoid that exports from third countries enter through the member with the lowest tariff (trade deflection). However, RoOs distort exporters' sourcing decisions and burden them with red tape. Using a global data set, we show that, for 86% of all bilateral product-level comparisons within FTAs, trade deflection is not profitable because external tariffs are rather similar and transportation costs are non-negligible; in the case of unilateral trade preferences extended by rich countries to poor ones that ratio is a striking 98%. The pervasive and unconditional use of RoOs is, therefore, hard to rationalize.","Traditionally, trade economists are skeptical of free trade agreements (FTAs) because of their preferential nature.==== FTAs grant advantages to some trade partners but withhold them from others. In that way, they lead to harmful trade diversion. Amongst regional trade agreements, customs unions (CUs) are usually preferred over FTAs, because the former create as much trade as the latter but typically divert trade less (Krueger, 1997). Moreover, CUs are less likely to be stumbling blocks for further trade liberalization (Missios et al., 2016). Nonetheless, only 9% of all trade agreements signed since 1945 are CUs (Dür et al., 2014).====While CUs usually have a common external tariff (at least for a subset of products), this is not the case with FTAs, at least formally. For this reason, in contrast to CUs, FTAs require rules of origin (RoOs) that define under which conditions a good is said to originate from a member country of the FTA so that it can benefit from a preferential tariff. Complying with these rules causes costly red tape.==== Moreover, they can distort firms' input sourcing (Conconi et al., 2018; Krishna and Krueger, 1995). They reduce preference utilization rates (PURs) to less than 100%, sometimes substantially so (Keck and Lendle, 2012). RoOs are, therefore, the unsavory sauce to Bhagwati's (1995) spaghetti bowl of bilateral trade agreements. According to advocates of RoOs, without them each imported commodity would enter the FTA through the country with the lowest tariff. In the absence of transportation costs, this arbitrage activity, often referred to as trade deflection, would have the consequence that the FTA member with the lowest tariff de facto sets a common external tariff for all FTA members.====Similarly, RoOs are also imposed on exporters from developing countries benefiting from unilateral tariff preferences granted by rich countries under preference schemes like the Generalized System of Preferences (GSPs). By burdening poor countries with red tape, they have the effect of counteracting the trade-creating effects; in some of the arrangements PURs are as low as 66% (Keck and Lendle, 2012).====Surprisingly, so far, no study has asked whether trade deflection is actually realistic empirically. If it is not, the existence of hundreds of pages of text on RoOs in modern FTAs would be indicative of rent seeking rather than necessary due to the inherent logic of a trade agreement (which may be questioned per se on other grounds).====In this paper, we use a newly compiled data set of MFN (most favored nation) and preferential tariffs at the 6-digit level. We document a fact that, to the best of our knowledge, has been overlooked so far: for most country-pairs in FTAs, trade deflection is unprofitable. The reason for this is that tariffs are generally low, countries in a common FTA tend to have similar external tariff levels, and when tariff levels differ, deflection is profitable at most for one country in the pair. When preferences are granted unilaterally by a rich country to a poor one, trade deflection is almost never profitable by design: the poor countries maintain their (often high) external tariffs ==== so that goods from third countries can rarely be profitably transshipped through them to the rich country or through the rich country to them.====The upshot is that FTAs or GSP arrangements should not require proof of origin by default, except for those few products where differences in external tariffs are larger than some threshold level (determined by the additional transportation costs that would arise if firms attempt to exploit tariff differences).====Concerns with RoOs and their side effects is wide-spread in the literature. It is a key ingredient in Bhagwati's (1995) “ Spaghetti Bowl” parable. In his words, RoOs are “====”. They make “====.” More generally, as also highlighted by Baldwin (2016), with the spread of international production networks, it is increasingly problematic to operate trade policy on the assumption that one can cleanly identify the nationality of a product. As a consequence, FTAs are “==== “(Bhagwati, 1995).====RoOs come in a multitude of forms. All regimes require that a product undergoes “ substantial transformation” in the originating country. This could be a minimum value added content requirement, a change in tariff classification, or a combination of these. For example, the text of a modern trade agreement, the Canada-EU Trade Agreement (CETA), defines the following RoOs for a food product falling under HS heading 19.01 (“ Malt Extract”): “====.” Needless to say, if countries are members to different FTAs, they have to comply with potentially different and conflicting RoOs.====In the recent revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, a lot of political capital was invested into tightening RoOs, in particular for autos. By requiring the minimum share of regional value added to increase from 62.5% to 75%, the new agreement squeezes out third country input suppliers with the objective to protect domestic suppliers.====The theoretical literature points to three reasons why RoOs lead to costs for businesses and welfare losses. First, the detailed and highly complex product-by-product criteria make them hard to meet. Exporters need to build up (legal) know-how to comply with the rules. Second, exporters face different RoOs depending on the export-destination due to multiple FTAs with little overlap in the design of the RoOs.==== Third, if exporters need to adjust their global supply chains to meet RoOs requirements, trade patterns and investment flows are distorted (Krishna, 2006; Krishna and Krueger, 1995). This can have extreme implications. In a simple model, Deardorff (2018) shows that, even when every country has an FTA with every other country, due to RoOs, the level of welfare in such a situation can be lower than in the situation where no FTA was present and only MFN tariffs apply.====The empirical evidence confirms the negative effects of complying with RoOs. The compliance costs associated with meeting RoOs requirements range from 3 to 15% of final product prices depending on the method used to measure the restrictiveness of RoOs (Anson et al., 2005; Cadot et al., 2006; Carrère and de Melo, 2006; Estevadeordal, 2000). Andersson (2015), Augier et al. (2005), and Bombarda and Gamberoni (2013), use the liberalization of the EU's RoOs as a natural experiment and find a positive effect on total trade. Constructing a new database on NAFTA RoOs, Conconi et al. (2018) show that in the absence of RoOs, Mexican imports of intermediates from third countries relative to NAFTA partners would have been 45% higher. Further, firm-level evidence suggests heterogeneity across firms as mostly larger firms actually comply with the RoOs while smaller firms have difficulties doing so (Cadot et al., 2014; Demidova et al., 2012). Firm surveys show that RoOs hinder firms use of FTA preferences (Wignaraja et al., 2010). Also, preference utilization rates of less than 100% indicate high fixed costs associated with RoOs (Keck and Lendle, 2012).====There is also a theoretical literature on the choice between FTAs and CUs. In FTAs, participating countries do not have to delegate policy making authority to a common institution, which should facilitate concluding the agreement. Facchini et al. (2013) provide arguments why FTAs might yield higher welfare for the prospective member countries when voters strategically choose a very protectionist representative to conduct the negotiations. Appelbaum and Melatos (2012) model the conditions under which members in FTAs choose similar external tariffs; a situation they describe as “camouflaged” CUs. Lake and Yildiz (2016) also endogenize the choice between FTAs and CUs and explain why CUs are only intra-regional while FTAs are inter- and intra-regional.====Section 2 of the present paper presents the simple analytical conditions under which trade deflection is profitable. This analysis guides our empirical analysis. Section 3 presents the data. Besides tariff data and information about trade agreements we also need bilateral transportation costs. In this section, we construct pair-product specific transportation costs using disaggregated data on cif/fob imports for the USA and use a simple econometric model to provide out-of-sample predictions for all other product-pair combinations. We validate our approach using data from New Zealand.====Section 4 uses the data to assess countries' scope for trade deflection, which is surprisingly low. For countries in the same FTA, in 29% of all country-pair×product×third-country combinations for the year 2014, countries set identical external tariffs. Trade deflection means taking advantage of arbitrage possibilities. Therefore, by definition trade deflection could be profitable for one of the members of a pair, while for the other it cannot be profitable; this is the case for 38% of candidate cases. For 4% of all cases, external tariffs are different but the preferential tariff between ==== is still high so that deflection is not profitable. So, in only 29% of all cases, the tariff situation could make trade deflection profitable if there were no transportation costs. In 16% of all cases, the tariff savings are smaller than additional transportation costs. Hence, in sum, for fully 86% of all cases, in FTAs, trade deflection is not profitable.====In non-reciprocal preferential trade arrangements (GSP), only in 7% of all cases are tariffs such that trade deflection could work in the absence of transportation costs. Factoring in the latter, the fraction falls to a mere 2%. Note that these numbers are conservative because we consider only transportation costs, disregarding other trade costs such as those related to writing and enforcing contracts, exchange rate risk, management costs, and so on.====Our analysis suggests that, in a large number of cases, there is no economic rationale for RoOs. Section 5 draws policy conclusions. The most important is that exporters should be required to prove the origin of goods only when trade deflection is a real possibility which is quite often not the case. More specifically, we suggest that, in new FTAs, negotiators should agree on a full set of RoOs for all products, but that the requirement to prove origin be activated only if external tariffs of FTA members differ by some minimum amount. In the case of non-reciprocal preferential trade arrangements (GSP), RoOs should be activated only for those products where the beneficiary country undercuts the MFN tariffs of the preference granting country. Our proposal could disentangle Bhagwati's spaghetti bowl a bit. It would create incentives for countries to align their external tariffs, thus emulating CUs. It could also help dealing with the exit of countries from long established CUs, such as Britain's or Turkey's potential exits from the EU's customs union.",Rules of origin and the profitability of trade deflection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300662,14 August 2019,2019,Research Article,225.0

The model focuses on the interaction between domestic institutions and international organizations that promote reform, on the one hand, and the political incentives for reversing reforms, on the other. At equilibrium, there are three types of reform paths. A country can undergo a full-scale, lasting reform, can carry out a partial but lasting reform, or can go through cycles of reforms and costly counter-reforms. Domestic institutions, along with the incentives provided by international organizations, determine the equilibrium path. A politically myopic international organization may induce cycles of reforms and costly counter-reforms, thereby reducing the country's well-being. An international organization that only provides funds to promote reforms may have a less beneficial effect than one that assists the country with fresh funds to defend reforms when there is a risk of reversal. International funds that promote reforms can also influence domestic institutions. For example, due to the intervention of an international organization, countries could have incentives to dismantle institutions that build up reversal cost and/or do not fully build their fiscal capacity.","In the early 1990s, many countries began to implement structural reforms. The paths followed by those reforms have differed greatly across countries. Academic scholars as well as policy-makers have overwhelmingly focused their attention on local institutions as the key factors in promoting or blocking reforms. While there is little doubt that local institutions play a very important role in determining the pace of structural reform, we argue that the interaction between local institutions and international organizations should not be ignored. When international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Union offer to provide countries with funding for the implementation of structural reforms, they become important players in the eyes of local politicians, and the reform path is thus shaped not only by local institutions, but also by the incentives provided by those organizations. We also argue that, in order to explain why structural reforms take the paths that they do, we need to understand not only the political mechanisms behind the factors that promote or block reforms, but also the political logic of counter-reforms.====In order to study the determinants of reform paths, including the role played by international organizations in that regard, we develop a dynamic model of reform that incorporates the following features: (i) Reforms are socially beneficial, but they produce winners (the pro-reform coalition) and losers (the anti-reform coalition); (ii) The government has to provide reform opponents with at least partial compensation in order to succeed in passing reforms, but there are economic and institutional limits to the resources that it can mobilize for that purpose; (iii) The political landscape is unstable and, consequently, the government may come under the control of pro-reform or anti-reform coalitions, with the result that there are windows of opportunity for the introduction of reforms, but there are also windows of opportunity for their reversal; (iv) Reversing reforms is costly for everybody, including the anti-reform coalition; (v) International organizations provide funding for reforms and funding to help the government to avert reversals.====In our model there are two domestic groups – the pro-reform coalition and the anti-reform coalition – and an international organization. In each period, the government, which is controlled by one of the domestic coalitions, selects a level of structural reform. When the pro-reform coalition controls the government, it is possible to introduce a given level of reform or sustain a previously adopted level of reform, but only if a portion of the anti-reform coalition is compensated for the losses incurred during that period. There are two sources of funding for use in providing compensation. First, the government can collect taxes. Second, the international organization can provide funds to incentivize reforms. At the beginning of each period, the coalition that does not control the government has an exogenous random chance of gaining political control. Every time that this happens, there is a window of opportunity for the implementation of reforms (when the pro-reform coalition gains control) or counter-reforms (when the anti-reform coalition gains control). While reforms require that compensation be given to the anti-reform coalition, reversals are costly. The cost of reversals must be paid by each of the domestic coalitions. There are four key parameters in the model that capture domestic institutional characteristics and international incentives for reform. The maximum tax rate that the government can impose on its citizens and the incentive schedule offered by the international organization shape the revenue available for use as compensation. The portion of the anti-reform coalition that must be compensated shapes the extent of expenditure on compensation. Finally, the cost of reversal is the key parameter behind the anti-reform coalition's reversal decision.====Depending on the institutional characteristics of the country (i.e., domestic funds available for use as compensation, the portion of the anti-reform coalition that requires compensation and the cost of a reversal), but also on the amount of funding provided by international organizations and the terms and conditions attached to it, the equilibrium of the model induces one of the following reform paths: first, a country may experience a full-fledged, lasting reform that will never be reversed; second, a country may undergo a partial but lasting reform; or, third, a country may go through cycles of reform and counter-reform.====As a benchmark, let us consider a situation in which there is no international intervention. Whenever the pro-reform coalition controls the government, it tries to pass the most ambitious reforms possible because current reform decisions do not affect future reversal decisions. If the pro-reform coalition has to provide compensation to a significant proportion of the anti-reform coalition, but it has the necessary funds to do so, the country may undergo a full-fledged, lasting reform. Whenever the pro-reform coalition gains control, a comprehensive reform can be implemented. The anti-reform coalition does not have an incentive to introduce counter-reforms because it knows that the compensation that it will receive will cover a significant proportion of the “losers” and, hence, there is no point in incurring the costs involved in reversing the reforms. When the pro-reform coalition must compensate a significant proportion of the anti-reform coalition but does not have the required funds to do so, then the country will undergo a partial but lasting reform process. This is because if there are not enough funds available to buy off a large enough segment of the anti-reform coalition, then the pro-reform coalition will not succeed in passing a full-fledged reform package. As a consequence, the pro-reform coalition will be forced to implement more modest reform measures, which may be disappointing, but will also be less likely to be reversed. Finally, when the budget for compensation is large relative to the proportion of the anti-reform coalition that must be bought off in order to pass a reform, the country will be prone to cycles of reform and counter-reform. If the pro-reform coalition has a large budget for paying out compensation and only a small fraction of the anti-reform coalition must be co-opted in order to pass a reform bill, then the pro-reform coalition will pass a very ambitious reform package. As a consequence, the majority of the anti-reform coalition will be faced with an aggressive reform and receive no compensation. In the short run, this is not an issue, but as soon as the anti-reform coalition has the chance to regain control of the government, it will initiate a counter-reform process. Notice that, ex ante, the pro-reform coalition may prefer to commit itself to selecting a more moderate reform or to compensating a larger proportion of the anti-reform coalition than strictly necessary if this will avert costly reversals. However, when the pro-reform coalition controls the government, the reform chosen in any given period does not affect reversal decisions in the future, which depend only on future expected levels of reform. The problem is that the pro-reform coalition cannot credibly commit to implementing a future level of structural reform. In other words, the pro-reform coalition faces a commitment problem at the time when it selects the level of structural reforms to be adopted.====When an international organization provides funds to promote and sustain reforms, more ambitious reforms are passed, but reversals are also more likely. In other words, there is a trade-off between the scope of the reform measures and their stability. Formally, we show that international intervention expands the region of the parameter space in which there is a reversal in equilibrium and contracts the region of the parameter space in which there is a partial but lasting reform or even no reform at all. The logic is as follows. If the pro-reform coalition can use external funds to compensate the anti-reform coalition, it will be easier for it to pass a more aggressive reform package. When a large part of the anti-reform coalition must be compensated, reversal is not an issue and, hence, the reform remains in place indefinitely. However, when only a relatively small proportion of the anti-reform coalition must be compensated, the availability of international funds also makes the reversal of reforms a more attractive option for the anti-reform coalition.====The model also generates interesting normative results. In particular, we explore the welfare implications of international interventions. If the international organization that is trying to influence domestic policy is fully aware of the possibility of reversals, then the intervention will always enhance the well-being of the country. However, if the international organization does not take the possibility of reversals into account or miscalculates the likelihood of such events, the intervention may induce an ambitious but temporary reform process which may be reversed later on, thereby reducing the country's well-being. We also show that an international organization that limits its role to that of providing funds to promote reforms may have a less beneficial effect than an international organization that does not actively promote reforms but does assist the country with fresh funds when there is a risk of reversal. In this sense, the model provides a political economy justification for the approach followed by the IMF during the Brazilian crisis and by the European Union during the Greek crisis. At the same time, the extension casts some doubt on the wisdom of the IMF's actions during the Argentine crisis.====We also develop several extensions of the model, which allow us to endogenize the institutional characteristics of the country and study how international interventions influence them. First, we explore two extensions where we introduce a stage before the reform game is played in which the country selects the cost of reversal and the maximum tax rate, respectively. We interpret this stage as a Constitutional choice that affects the domestic institutions of the country (for example, the maximum tax rate can be seen as fiscal capacity). We consider a benevolent Constitution that maximizes the expected discounted welfare of the country. These extensions generate a set of new results. International interventions will not only directly change the incentives for reform, but also distort domestic institutional choices. In particular, we show that countries could have incentives to dismantle institutions that build up reversal cost and/or do not fully develop their fiscal capacity.====Second, we endogenize the proportion of the anti-reform coalition entitled to receive compensation and show that this helps to partially overcome the commitment problem faced by the pro-reform coalition. We also connect this extension with the idea that international organizations should provide funds to defend reforms. Indeed, allowing to the pro-reform coalition to temporarily commit to pay compensation to a larger segment of the anti-reform coalition and defensive funds provided by the international organization are two alternative ways to ameliorate the commitment problem faced by the pro-reform coalition.====Finally, we briefly explore how to extend the model to consider policy changes such as human-rights reforms that also generate non-pecuniary benefits.",International organizations and the political economy of reforms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300674,8 August 2019,2019,Research Article,226.0

This paper contributes to our understanding of this subject by analyzing the impact of foreign acquisitions on plant-level energy intensity. The analysis applies a difference-in-differences approach combined with ,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a powerful force of convergence across countries. In addition to bringing capital and creating jobs, FDI stimulates economic growth by enhancing firm-level efficiency. It does so directly by transferring cutting-edge technologies and management practices to its affiliates (Arnold and Javorcik, 2009; Chen, 2011; Javorcik and Poelhekke, 2017) and encouraging product and process innovation (Guadalupe et al., 2012) as well as indirectly through knowledge spillovers (Javorcik, 2004; Havranek and Irsova, 2011).====The spectacular growth in FDI flows, along with the increasing importance of developing economies as host countries, has raised concerns about the potential effect of FDI on the natural environment (Zarsky, 1999). On the one hand, environmentalists argue that highly polluting multinationals relocate to countries with weaker environmental standards in order to circumvent costly regulations in their home country (Hanna, 2010; Millimet and Roy, 2015; Cai et al., 2016). In this way, they increase pollution levels not only in host countries but also globally.==== On the other hand, supporters of globalization point to studies that fail to find evidence of multinationals in polluting industries being attracted to locations with weak regulations (Dean et al., 2009; Javorcik and Wei, 2004) and point out that FDI may have a positive effect on natural environment because multinationals tend to use more advanced technologies and production methods than their domestic counterparts.==== Since the existing literature (reviewed below) has produced mixed results, the issue remains controversial (Kellenberg, 2009; Cole et al., 2017).====This study contributes to our understanding of the link between FDI and environmental protection by taking a novel approach. Rather than examining whether FDI flows are influenced by environmental standards in the destination countries or whether polluting industries are more likely to engage in FDI, we examine the impact of foreign acquisitions on energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions of acquired plants.==== We use plant-level panel data from the Indonesian Manufacturing Census covering the period 1983–2001 (or 1983–2008 in a robustness check). To investigate the impact of foreign acquisitions on plant performance, we combine a difference-in-differences approach with propensity score matching, where matching is done within industry-year cells. This allows us to account for selection on observables and unobservable time-invariant plant heterogeneity and for confounding factors that affect both domestic and foreign-owned establishments within the same industry in the same year. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to employ such an approach in determining the effect of foreign ownership on plant-level environmental performance.====The ideal measure of a plant's environmental performance is the total amount of pollution the plant emits at a particular time period, principally because it accounts for (potentially) different pollution abatement technologies applied by different firms. However, getting data on plant-level emissions across periods remains extremely difficult, particularly in developing countries. This is the reason why a number of studies resort to approximations of environmental performance using plant-level expenditures on pollution-emitting inputs such as energy (see, for example, Eskeland and Harrison, 2003; Cole et al., 2008a, Barrows and Ollivier, 2014, Barrows and Ollivier, 2018). Building upon this literature, we approximate plant-level environmental performance by considering energy usage in physical units and converting it into CO==== emissions using standard conversion factors specific to each type of energy input.====We can observe fuel switching because the dataset includes plant-level expenditures (in Rps) and physical usage (e.g., in metric tons or liters) of each energy input. The energy inputs consist of fuels and lubricants and electricity. Fuels and lubricants are divided into more detailed inputs, which include gasoline, diesel, diesel oil, kerosene, lubricant, bunker oil, coal, coke, public gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), firewood, and charcoal. We have information on the amount of fuels and lubricants that are used for electricity generation, as some of the plants produce electricity for their own consumption and for sale to other end users. With this information, any reallocation to lower-carbon inputs is captured in our emission measure.====Our analysis is based on 210 foreign acquisition cases where an acquired plant is observed two years before and at least three years after an ownership change and for which a carefully selected control plant exists. The results suggest that, while foreign ownership increases total energy use and carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions in acquired plants due to expansion of the production scale, it lowers the energy and emission intensity of output. The reduction in energy use relative to output is nontrivial, ranging from 26% in the acquisition year to 30% two years later. These results are robust to different matching and estimation procedures, a longer time horizon, accounting for the potential effect of markups, and taking into account competitive pressures from foreign affiliates within the same local market. They are also robust to extending the sample time period to 1983–2008. While this extension allows us to consider more acquisition cases, it comes at the price of less disaggregated data on fuel usage, which is why we focus on the shorter time period in the main analysis.====We also find that the reduction in fuel intensity takes place immediately after the ownership change, while the reduction in electricity intensity happens more slowly and is somewhat less pronounced. Our results also indicate that plants with different initial energy intensity benefit from acquisition differently. In particular, plants with higher energy intensity (possibly smaller and less efficient plants) tend to reduce their energy and emission intensities more than those that are already less energy intensive. This finding might explain why previous literature on the relationship between foreign ownership and plant-level energy intensity produced mixed results (see, for example, Eskeland and Harrison, 2003; Cole et al., 2008a).====To shed light on the channels through which foreign ownership leads to improvements in energy efficiency we bring in an additional dataset and demonstrate that our conclusions hold even if we restrict attention to plants with next to no changes in the output mix and when we control for contemporaneous changes in output. In other words, we eliminate the possibility that foreign ownership works solely through changes to the production structure or the scale channel. Our findings are thus very suggestive of foreign acquisitions being associated with improvements to the production process taking place through introduction of better technologies and better management.====In an additional exercise, which is quite novel relative to the existing literature, we consider foreign divestments, i.e., sales of foreign affiliates to domestic owners. We find that such divestments are accompanied by an increase in energy and emission intensities as well as a decline in output. The increase in energy use relative to output is quite substantial, reaching 29% two years after the ownership change. This finding is consistent with the conclusions of Javorcik and Poelhekke (2017) who show deterioration in performance after foreign divestments and conclude that the productivity advantage associated with foreign ownership results from continuous injections of knowledge and management practices from the parent company.====In a motivating exercise conducted at the aggregate level, we find that energy and emission intensities in Indonesian manufacturing as a whole improved by 31% from 1983 to 2001. We show that at the industry level the decline in the aggregate weighted energy intensity is positively associated with the increased presence of foreign affiliates. The improvement seems to be driven by both within-plant reduction in energy intensity as well as reallocation of market shares towards more energy-efficient producers.====Our paper contributes to the literature examining how foreign ownership influences plant-level environmental performance. Within this broad literature, there are very few papers that study firm's actual energy use or pollution emissions, and the evidence is still mixed. Pargal and Wheeler (1996) use information on plant-level emissions of water pollution, measured in terms of biological oxygen demand (i.e., kilograms of oxygen needed over 5 days to completely oxidize the organic pollutants emitted), which was collected by the Indonesian Environment Ministry's PROKASIH (Clean Rivers) program for 1989–90. After controlling for plant scale, age and efficiency, they find that foreign ownership does not have a significant effect on water pollution emissions. Their results rely on cross-sectional data and thus capture correlations rather than a causal effect. Eskeland and Harrison (2003) examine plant-level data from Cote d'Ivoire, Mexico and Venezuela and find that the energy share, i.e., the cost of energy use divided by the total value of the plant's output, is negatively related to foreign ownership. Although the authors control for plant demand for other inputs and some plant characteristics, data limitations prevent them from controlling for plant fixed effects. Their results should be interpreted as correlations. Cole et al. (2008a) use plant-level data from Ghana and find no strong evidence of foreign ownership influencing total energy use. Instead, and perhaps correlated with foreign ownership, plants with foreign-trained managers are found to have lower energy intensity. Again, the study is unable to take into account unobservable plant heterogeneity and captures correlations. Albornoz et al. (2009) employ a cross-section of approximately 1200 firms in Argentina and find a positive correlation between foreign ownership and implementation of environmental management systems.====Our paper extends this literature in several ways. First, we take into account selection into foreign ownership, i.e., the possibility that foreign investors choose to acquire local plants with better environmental performance, and thus our results come much closer to capturing a causal effect of foreign ownership. Second, we work with panel data and hence we are able to take into account unobservable plant heterogeneity and examine the stability of the estimated effects over time. Third, we are also able to measure energy use in physical units and provide a more detailed analysis on the types of fuel used.====Our work also makes a contribution to the relatively new literature examining the effects of foreign acquisitions on the acquired plants. This literature relies on propensity score matching combined with a difference-in-differences approach (Arnold and Javorcik, 2009; Chen, 2011; Wang and Wang, 2015; Bircan, 2019) or uses inverse probability of treatment weighting (Guadalupe et al., 2012) to address selection into foreign ownership. We use the former methodology, which is well established in this literature, but focus on a completely different outcome. While the existing studies focus on plant-level total factor productivity, export and import intensity, profitability and innovation, we aim to capture plant-level environmental performance by examining plant-level energy intensity and CO==== emission intensity. These outcomes have not been considered by the existing studies.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information on Indonesia and on why multinational owners are more likely to invest in energy efficiency. It also describes how we measure energy usage and emissions. Section 3 presents motivation for our analysis: an industry-level exercise demonstrating correlations between energy efficiency and the presence of foreign owned plants. Section 4 discusses our empirical approach to understanding the link between FDI and plant-level energy intensity. In Section 5, we present the main results from our analysis. Section 6 deepens the analysis by looking at changes in use of individual energy inputs, channels through which foreign ownership may affect energy efficiency and nonlinear effect arising from different pre-acquisition energy intensity. Section 7 examines the effects of foreign divestments. Section 8 concludes by considering potential policy implications of our findings.","Good for the environment, good for business: Foreign acquisitions and energy intensity",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300650,7 August 2019,2019,Research Article,227.0

We address this question by investigating the effects of the negotiation and implementation of PTAs on the use of antidumping (AD) (i.e., the most common form of contingent trade protection) by member countries against non-members as there has been a concurrent surge in regionalism and AD activity since the 1990s. Theoretically-derived empirical predictions are supported by the empirical analysis based on the 15 most intense users of AD. The results demonstrate that both the negotiation and the implementation of PTAs lead to fewer AD measures against non-member countries, except for members of customs-union agreements in force facing large import surges from non-members. Thus, our results highlight a building-block effect of PTAs on multilateral trade cooperation when it comes to AD protection.","The world has witnessed an astounding proliferation of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) since the early 1990s.

The sheer number of such agreements has generated a large body of literature, started by Bhagwati (1991), analyzing whether PTAs are “building blocks” or “stumbling blocks” towards multilateral trade liberalization, which would be the first-best policy.==== A second major trend that has dominated international commercial policy over the same period is the dramatic increase in antidumping (AD) activity. Although the stated objective of AD is to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping (i.e., exporting a product at less than “fair” value), AD activity in practice has nothing to do with maintaining a fair trading environment. AD “is simply a modern form of protection” (Blonigen and Prusa, 2003), being nowadays employed on a regular basis by many developed and developing countries alike.====Since AD measures can provide governments with a flexible trade policy instrument at a time when WTO commitments severely constrain the use of most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs, it is natural to ask whether the building- or stumbling-block effect of PTAs might manifest itself (also) through the use of such measures. This natural question has not received much attention in the literature up to now, although in his recent survey article on PTAs, Limão (2016) does point out that the interdependence of PTAs and non-tariff barriers against non-member countries is an important avenue for future research. This is the objective of this empirical paper, which aims to shed light on the ramifications of PTAs for their member countries' extra-PTA AD activity (i.e., the AD activity of PTA members against non-members).====A number of theoretical contributions have looked at whether PTAs help or hinder multilateral trade liberalization. However, the theoretical literature on this question remains largely inconclusive as the answer depends on the modeling assumptions. This makes the empirical investigation of this issue all the more relevant. To guide our empirical strategy for identifying the relationship between PTAs and AD, we rely on the theoretical work by Tabakis, 2010, Tabakis, 2015. These papers explore the implications of the (symmetric) formation of, respectively, customs unions (CUs) and free-trade areas (FTAs) for contingent protection. Both papers employ a dynamic game of trade-policy setting, in which countries are limited to self-enforcing cooperative multilateral agreements—as is common in the literature—and the economic environment is characterized by exogenous trade-volume volatility. In terms of AD measures, which are the focus of our paper, three testable predictions emerge from Tabakis, 2010, Tabakis, 2015: (i) the number of AD measures of members against non-members of an FTA agreement should decrease both during its negotiation and after its implementation; (ii) the number of AD measures of members against non-members of a CU agreement should decrease during its negotiation; and (iii) the number of AD measures of members against non-members of a CU agreement should increase following its implementation for “high” import volumes from non-member countries, whereas the reverse should be true for “low” volumes of imports.====To empirically test these predictions, we have built a novel dataset comprising detailed data for many PTAs. In particular, the testing of our predictions requires information on the dates of the launch of negotiations for the different PTAs in our sample and of their entry into force. Using then AD data—and considering also other contingent measures—over the period 1980–2015 and implementing different econometric strategies, our results do provide clear support to the aforementioned theoretical predictions. Both the negotiation and the implementation of PTAs have a significant effect on the extent of AD use by PTA members against non-member countries. What is more important, PTAs generally have a dampening effect on their members' AD activity against the rest of the world, except when members of an implemented CU agreement face substantial import growth from non-member countries, exactly as predicted by the theoretical model of Tabakis (2010). In brief, our results suggest that with one notable exception (namely, CUs in force facing a substantial growth of extra-CU imports), PTAs are building blocks towards multilateral trade cooperation as far as AD protection is concerned.====Our paper contributes to the empirical literature on the ramifications of PTAs for multilateral trade liberalization, focusing on non-tariff barriers to trade. Some studies provide evidence in support of a building-block effect of PTAs (e.g., Estevadeordal et al., 2008), whereas others offer evidence showing that PTAs are stumbling blocks towards tariff liberalization at the multilateral level (e.g., Limão, 2006; Karacaovali and Limão, 2008). The paper by Estevadeordal et al. (2008), which also makes a distinction between FTAs and CUs, is probably the closest to ours (at least) as far as results are concerned. Their findings suggest that FTAs produce a building-block effect, while CUs are characterized by a considerably smaller reduction, if at all, in members' MFN tariffs than FTAs, which is very much in line with our findings. Our work complements these (and other) papers by highlighting that AD (i.e., the most important non-tariff barrier) constitutes a different channel through which PTAs affect multilateral trade cooperation. In other words, we demonstrate that in order to get a more thorough picture regarding the implications of regionalism for the multilateral trading system, other policy instruments besides MFN tariffs should be taken into consideration.====In relation to the interplay specifically between PTAs and AD use, only four papers (to the best of our knowledge) examine the empirical effects of PTAs on AD using cross-country evidence. Ahn and Shin (2011) look at the effect of FTAs on the intra-FTA AD filings of major AD users over 1995–2009 and find that FTAs negatively affect the number of AD investigations between FTA partners. Silberberger and Stender (2018) explore the impact of PTAs on the bilateral use of AD measures over the period 1991–2014 while explicitly considering the degree of intra-block tariff liberalization. They show that PTAs reduce in general the likelihood of AD activity between PTA members, but an improvement in the relative tariff treatment between PTA partners results in a higher likelihood of bilateral AD activity than an equal improvement between non-integration trade partners. By contrast, Prusa and Teh (2010), in a paper which is quite close in spirit to ours, investigate the ramifications of PTAs for both intra-PTA AD filings and AD filings against non-member countries. They find that AD provisions in PTAs decrease the incidence of intra-PTA AD cases but lead to an increase in the number of members' filings against non-member countries. Postponing the discussion on the discrepancy between the latter result and our findings, it is important to stress at this point that our paper differs from these previous studies in two major respects. First, we explore the impact of PTAs on the use of AD protection not only after their implementation but also during their negotiation, clearly distinguishing between the two phases. Second, we allow for differential effects between FTAs and CUs. As the theoretical models by Tabakis, 2010, Tabakis, 2015 suggest and our empirical analysis verifies, making both distinctions is critical in order to get deeper insights into the ramifications of PTAs for AD protection. Finally, Bown and Tovar (2016) examine whether the trade integration of Argentina and Brazil within the context of MERCOSUR over 1990–2001 produced a building-block or a stumbling-block effect, while taking into consideration both MFN tariffs and contingent protection (AD and safeguards). They conclude that it is important to consider trade barriers beyond MFN tariffs in order to properly characterize the relationship between preferential liberalization and liberalization towards third countries (i.e., non-member countries). They further conclude that there was no effect during the years MERCOSUR was an FTA, while they provide evidence of a significant stumbling-block effect once MERCOSUR evolved into a CU (i.e., during 1995–2001). In comparison with Bown and Tovar (2016), we use a much broader sample of countries and a longer sample period as well as look at the cooperation effects of PTAs while being negotiated, aiming to provide a comprehensive picture of the implications of PTAs for the world trading system.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a non-technical presentation of the theoretical framework that can be used to analyze the impact of regionalism on the employment of contingent protection. Section 3 discusses the empirical predictions that follow from this framework and how they can be econometrically tested. Section 4 is dedicated to the description of the data. The empirical results are presented in Section 5, together with a quantification of their implications for the use of AD and several robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.",Preferential trade agreements and antidumping protection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300649,5 August 2019,2019,Research Article,228.0

Moreover, direct investment flows constitute a considerable fraction of cross-border transactions. For example, U.S. direct investment flows in 2013 composed about half of the total U.S. net acquisition of foreign financial assets, and foreign direct investment flows were about 20% of the total foreign net acquisition of U.S. financial assets.==== There is an extensive empirical literature studying the determinants of capital inflows, that has mostly centered on macroeconomic conditions, monetary and exchange rate policy, geographic proximity, and institutional factors (see Faeth, 2009 for a survey of the literature). In this paper, I focus on political disagreement instead. More specifically, I study whether partisan conflict on trade policy deters foreign direct investment.====Partisan conflict is relevant for the evolution of foreign direct investment flows to the US because the expected returns of investment projects become less predictable when policy is uncertain. Foreign direct investors typically have a long time horizon when operating abroad. They are less informed about the policy environment and may be treated differently than domestic investors (Bhattacharya et al., 2007). Moreover, FDI cannot be easily reversed without paying large costs (Rivoli and Salorio, 1996). Hence, forward-looking foreign investors must be constantly anticipating how changes in trade policy could affect the expected returns of their investments and/or their barriers to enter and exit the US market.====Following the large contraction in cross border investment flows during the 2008 Financial Crisis and its unusually slow recovery from the Great Recession (see Fig. 2), together with the high levels of uncertainty caused by the political climate in the US, the detrimental effects of policy uncertainty gained interest as a possible explanation (Julio and Yook, 2016).==== The standard approach in this literature uses the timing of elections to measure variations in policy uncertainty (see Durnev, 2010 and Julio and Yook, 2012, Julio and Yook, 2016). This paper complements the literature by considering, in addition to using the timing of elections, an important underlying cause of uncertainty: the degree of conflict between actors determining ====. To the extent policymakers disagree on the details and sustainability of a trade agreement (such as NAFTA) or whether to impose protectionist policies (such as tariffs), uncertainty over whether the policy will be implemented and about its characteristics can affect the behavior of foreign investors. I develop the Trade Partisan Conflict Index (TPCI), which tracks the frequency of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement on trade policy in a given month. Higher index values indicate greater conflict among political parties, Congress, and the President. The index rises not only when elections take place (and trade policy is discussed during the campaign), but also around well-known policy debates such as those surrounding international trade agreements such as GATT, NAFTA, and TPP, as well as the implementation of barriers to imports (such as the steel import quota of 1999), and measures that may affect the returns to cross-country capital flows. Hence, it is a complementary measure of political uncertainty to the timing of elections or political turnover. Because it is measured at the monthly level, it allows us to estimate the effects of uncertainty at shorter frequencies than alternative uncertainty proxies. Relative to the timing of elections, for example, we could analyze the effects in off-election periods. Relative to other similar measures of uncertainty, such as the Partisan Conflict Index (PCI) developed by Azzimonti (2018) or the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index developed by Baker et al. (2016), it has the advantage of capturing uncertainty about information that is potentially more relevant for FDI, namely trade policy. Finally, since the measure is based on political disagreement as reported by the media, it is potentially a good summary statistic of the information used by foreign investors to make decisions and update their expectations.====The first empirical model considered in this paper aims at estimating the effect of TPCI on foreign direct investment from the rest of the world as a percentage of the existing position at the beginning of a given quarter. I include standard control variables, such as trade openness, changes in the exchange rate, the level of inflation, the growth rate of GDP, the federal funds rate, and whether Presidential elections are held. I find that a one standard deviation increase in TPCI in a given quarter results in about 0.115 standard-deviation decline in investment flows (as percentage of the position in the country) in the following quarter. This corresponds to about a 9% decline in FDI flows from their sample mean. Since TPCI may not be the only source of political uncertainty, I also consider the effects of PCI and EPU together with TPCI in an augmented model. I find that the result is robust to introducing these variables. Finally, I also consider alternative measures of expectations typically used in the literature to reduce potential omitted variable bias (such as consumer confidence and predictions regarding GDP growth), but these do not significantly alter the results. When these variables are included a 10% increase in TPCI results in about 9.84% decline in FDI flows from their sample mean.====I also study investment flows to the US disaggregated by country of origin (e.g parent country).==== I consider a panel of 38 countries with annual data over the period 1985–2016. The multi-country model specification includes country specific control variables (such as the growth rate of the parent country, its inflation rate and changes in the degree of trade openness), pair-specific variables (such as changes in the bilateral exchange rate and bilateral trade with the US), US-centric variables (those used in the aggregate specification above), and country specific fixed-effects (to control for time invariant country characteristics such as geographic and language proximity). In the simplest specification, a one-standard deviation increase in TPCI is associated, on average, with a 0.027 standard-deviation decline in FDI flows as a percentage of the positions in the US in a given year. This corresponds to about a 7% decline in FDI from its mean when TPCI rises by 10%. When a proxy for expectations is included, the estimated response increases to about 13%. The result is robust to alternative specifications of the econometric model (e.g., excluding lags of macroeconomic variables, considering a non-linear relationship, and different proxies for the state of the US economy).====Finally, I also consider whether countries in different geographical regions or with different degrees of economic development have an heterogeneous response to changes in the trade partisan conflict index. I find that Canada and Mexico (both included in the NAFTA agreement) have a smaller reaction than other countries to increases in TPCI. Among those other countries, Middle-Eastern and East Asian countries have a stronger reaction to rises in TPCI than Canada and Mexico. This is not the case for European and South-East Asian countries. These results are, however, less robust to the model specification, so they should be taken with caution.",Does partisan conflict deter FDI inflows to the US?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300637,18 June 2019,2019,Research Article,229.0

Should trade policy differ across countries? Should worse performing (national) firms be protected from better performing (foreign) rivals? Should national product diversity be shielded against the potentially disruptive effects of cheaper imported goods? The answers to these questions crucially depend on market structure, demand characteristics and technological constraints. In particular, in the ‘canonical’ models of monopolistic competition with CES demand, iceberg trade friction, sunk entry costs, fixed production costs and constant marginal costs that are (inverse) Pareto distributed across firms, the free market equilibrium is efficient and there is, therefore, no room for welfare improving policy intervention: free trade is the best multilateral trade policy. More precisely, efficiency of the free market outcome is granted in models in which there is only the monopolistically competitive sector. When there is also another perfectly competitive (‘outside good’) sector, the relative size of the monopolistically competitive sector is inefficiently small due to markup pricing. Yet, as the markup is the same and constant across the monopolistic competitors, firms' sizes are efficient in both absolute and relative terms. This implies that the inefficiently small size of the monopolistically competitive sector materializes entirely through an inefficiently small number of firms (see, e.g., Melitz and Redding, 2014, Melitz and Redding, 2015).====The aim of the present paper is to show how all this ceases to hold once the CES assumption is removed, leading to new implications in terms of multilateral trade policy aimed at maximizing the joint welfare of all trade partners.==== In doing so, we focus on a specific deviation from CES known as ‘Marshall's Second Law of Demand’ (MSLD), according to which demand becomes more inelastic with consumption (Mrazova and Neary, 2013). As we discuss below, this assumption is both theoretically and empirically appealing. We show that under MSLD the free trade allocation of resources fails to be efficient in terms of product range, product selection and product mix with the extent of misallocation varying across countries depending on market size, state of technology and geography. For conciseness, we use ‘advantaged’ (‘disadvantaged’) to refer to countries with larger (smaller) domestic market size, better (worse) state of technology in terms of lower (higher) innovation and production costs, and better (worse) geography in terms of closer proximity to other countries. Our findings can then be summarized as follows. First, from a welfare point of view, too many products are sold to advantaged countries and too few are sold to disadvantaged ones (‘inefficient product range’). Second, conditional on range, relatively too many high cost products are sold to any country (‘inefficient product selection’). This inefficiency is, however, more severe for disadvantaged countries. Third, conditional on range and selection, the quantities of high cost products sold to any country are too large and those of low cost products are too small (‘inefficient product mix’). Also this inefficiency is more severe for disadvantaged countries. As a result, the free market provides an inefficiently high degree of welfare inequality between advantaged and disadvantaged countries if their differences in market size, state of technology and geography are large enough. There is, therefore, room for welfare improving multilateral policy intervention that: increases sales of low cost firms to all countries but especially to disadvantaged ones; decreases sales of high cost firms to all countries but especially to disadvantaged ones; reduces firm entry in all countries but especially in disadvantaged ones.====In our analytical framework market inefficiency stems from four types of externalities (Nocco et al., 2014; Behrens et al., 2016; Dhingra and Morrow, 2019). First, firms neglect their impact on product variety. Due to ‘love of variety’, the product range enters utility as a direct utility-enhancing argument on top of the quantities consumed. This acts as a driver towards too few varieties. Second, by keeping price above marginal cost, firms leave too much room for entry. This acts as a driver towards too many varieties. Third, firms neglect the negative impact of their entry on rivals' profits. This also acts as a driver towards too many varieties. These three externalities are the traditional ones already highlighted in earlier models of monopolistic competition (Spence, 1976; Dixit and Stiglitz, 1977) and operate also when firms are not heterogeneous. Their net effect on product range is generally ambiguous depending on the cross-elasticities of demand. A special case arises with CES demand: the opposite externalities exactly offset each other so that the free market outcome is efficient (without the ‘outside good’). The introduction of firm heterogeneity does not alter this property as CES demand implies the same constant markup for all firms so that also the product mix is efficient (Melitz and Redding, 2015). The presence of a fourth type of externality is tied to MSLD as, with MSLD but not with CES, firm heterogeneity becomes an additional driver of inefficiency. The fact that demand becomes more inelastic with consumption is reflected in larger markups for firms with lower marginal cost. As a result, these firms do not fully trasmit their cost advantage to prices. By softening competition, this generates a positive externality in favor of firms with higher marginal cost. The externality works at both the intensive and the extensive margins. At the intensive margin, higher marginal cost firms are inefficiently large relative to lower marginal costs firms. At the extensive margin, by keeping price above marginal cost more than their higher marginal cost rivals, lower marginal cost firms leave inefficiently larger room for entry.====Analyzing the MSLD case is important in many respects both theoretically and empirically. As pointed out by Mrazova and Neary (2013), Marshall (1920) argues this case represents the normal behavior of demand, an opinion shared also by Spence (1976), Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) and Krugman (1979). Subsequent studies have vindicated this view. MSLD plays a crucial role for some of the key traditional (non-CES) implications of trade models with monopolistic competition, including: ‘pro-competitive’ effects, through which trade liberalization reduces firms' markups (Krugman, 1979); ‘pricing to market’, through which firms set c.i.f. prices in each market they sell to rather than simply setting a single f.o.b. price in the market they sell from (Krugman, 1987); ‘dumping’, through which firms accept a lower profit margin per unit sold in foreign than in home markets (Brander and Krugman, 1983); and incomplete ‘pass through’, through which differences in firms' production costs traslate in less than proportionate price differences (Dornbusch, 1987).==== MSLD also underpins some newer implications of those models in the presence of firm heterogeneity. In particular, better performing firms (those with lower marginal cost and larger market shares) are predicted to set higher markups (Melitz and Ottaviano, 2008; Mayer et al., 2014, Mayer et al., 2016).==== Last but not least, several of the implications of MSLD are supported by mounting empirical evidence on firm performance based on price data (Berman et al., 2012; De Loecker and Goldberg, 2014; De Loecker et al., 2016) as well as on revenue data (Mayer et al., 2014, Mayer et al., 2016).====We perform our normative analysis of the free market outcome within the general equilibrium framework proposed by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008). This model with an ‘outside good’ and quasi-linear quadratic utility exhibits several features useful for our purposes.==== As it exhibits linear demand, it satisfies MSLD and thus features pro-competitive effects, pricing to market, dumping, and incomplete pass-through as well as higher markups for better performing firms.==== As it is analytically solvable with asymmetries in market size, technology and accessibility for an arbitrary number of countries, it allows for transparent comparative statics in a multi-country setup. As the marginal utility of income is constant and utility is transferable, it allows for a consistent efficiency analysis based on a straightforward definition of global welfare for an economy with heterogeneous countries as the sum of all individuals' indirect utilities. While one may note that the absence of income effects gives our investigation some partial equilibrium flavor, the framework still shares its focus on social surplus with a large body of trade policy analyses that abstract from distributive issues (Bagwell and Staiger, 2016).====Our analysis contributes to three main literatures. The first is the literature on optimal trade policy under imperfect competition (Helpman and Krugman, 1989; Grossman, 1992).==== This literature usually does not feature more than two countries. Its findings with homogeneous firms are summarized by Felbermayr et al. (2013): tariffs can correct for the distortion due to markup pricing (Flam and Helpman, 1987); tariffs can induce welfare-enhancing additional entry (Venables, 1987); tariffs can improve the terms of trade (Gros, 1987).==== With CES demand and monopolistic competition à la Krugman (1980) the incentives for a non-cooperative trade policy arise from the desire to eliminate monopolistic distortions and to improve domestic terms of trade (Campolmi et al., 2014). More recently, firm heterogeneity has been introduced in models of monopolistic competition. When demand is CES as in Melitz (2003) and tariffs are either set unilaterally by a small open economy (Demidova and Rodríguez-Clare, 2009; Haaland and Venables, 2016) or by a large open economy facing another large open economy (Felbermayr et al., 2013), trade barriers have beneficial effects on the protectionist country. By raising the country's wage, an import tariff produces an improvement in its terms-of-trade. When product variety is inefficiently poor, a tariff on imports, or a subsidy to domestic sales, increases the number of varieties offered by the market also correcting the mark-up distortion. Costinot et al. (2016) analyze the effects of firm-specific unilateral intervention by a large open economy and show that its welfare is maximized by optimal import taxes that discriminate against the most profitable foreign exporters and optimal export taxes that are uniform across domestic exporters. Campolmi et al. (2018) show that with two large countries the Nash equilibrium when both domestic and trade policies are available is characterized by first-best-level labor subsidies that achieve production efficiency, and inefficient import subsidies and export taxes that aim at improving domestic terms of trade. Non-CES demand à la Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) is considered by Bagwell and Lee (2018), who show that in the case of two symmetric countries there is an incentive for a country to introduce a small unilateral import tariff. They also identify the conditions under which two symmetric countries have unilateral incentives to introduce beggar-thy-neighbor export subsidies. Moreover, in the case of symmetric trade policies, they find that global free trade is generally inefficient. Within the same framework but without the outside good, Demidova (2017) shows that a unilateral reduction in a ‘wasteful’ import tariff (i.e. a frictional tariff that does not generate any tax revenue) increases the protectionist country's welfare both in the case of two large economies and in the case of a small open economy. Differently, when the import tariff is ‘non-wasteful’ (i.e. it generates tax revenues as in the other foregoing studies), in both cases unilateral trade liberalization reduces the country's welfare. Our contribution to this literature is the analysis of multilateral trade policy with heterogeneous firms for an arbitrary number of asymmetric countries that cooperatively maximize global welfare when demand is non-CES. For completeness we also investigate the incentives for a country to deviate from multilateral cooperation: they are consistent with the tradeoffs already highlighted by the existing literature on unilateral trade policy.====The second literature we contribute to studies optimal product variety in models of monopolistic competition without firm heterogeneity (Spence, 1976, and Dixit and Stiglitz, 1977) and with firm heterogeneity (Melitz and Redding, 2014; Nocco et al., 2014, Nocco et al., 2017; Dhingra and Morrow, 2019). This literature focuses on a closed (or ‘perfectly integrated’) economy or on open economies with symmetric countries.==== We extend this literature by investigating the role of country asymmetries in terms of market size, geographical barriers to trade and state of technology.====Third and last, we contribute to the growing literature on ‘misallocation’ in the wake of Hsieh and Klenow (2009), who use a closed economy CES model of monopolistic competition to show how output and capital distortions give rise to ‘wedges’ in marginal revenue products between firms, and how the welfare losses from those distortions can be quantified through the measurement of the corresponding wedges.==== As discussed by De Loecker and Goldberg (2014), trade policies fall nicely into this framework. While output tariffs and subsidies distort output markets due to their effects on competition, input tariffs and subsidies directly distort capital and intermediates markets. With CES demand and no ‘outside good’, reducing these distortions through trade liberalization necessarily improves welfare through a more efficient allocation of resources across firms. Our contribution to this literature is to show that, when demand is non-CES, free trade is not effcient and increasing trade liberalization does not necessarily improve welfare, even if full autarchy is never effcient. In particular, with asymmetric countries there are situations in which trade liberalization may actually increase the misallocation of resources towards less productive firms and countries.==== This can happen because the global welfare maximizing trade policy is not free trade.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model and Section 3 derives the free market outcome. Section 4 characterizes the efficient outcome. Section 5 compares the two outcomes, discussing the inefficiency of the former in terms of product range, product selection and product mix. It also analyzes the sources of the inefficiencies and the implications of the two outcomes for international inequality. Section 6 describes the first best multilateral trade policies that can be implemented to attain efficiency at the market equilibrium when policy tools are unconstrained. It also discusses second and third best policies when there are constraints on available tools. Section 7 looks at unilateral deviation from the efficient outcome. Section 8 briefly discusses some quantitative implications of the model. Section 9 concludes.","Geography, competition, and optimal multilateral trade policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300546,12 June 2019,2019,Research Article,230.0

In this paper, we aim to contribute to the debate by presenting evidence from the corporate loan market. Particularly, we seek to shed light on whether and how banks price in the potential effects of fiscal consolidation when lending.====How fiscal policy affects firms' cost of credit is important because the transmission of fiscal policy to economic activity may depend on the credit constraints firms face (Aghion et al., 2014). The literature is limited and primarily based on country-level aggregate data on corporate bonds, and the evidence is inconclusive.==== Here, we focus on credit markets instead of bond markets and exploit loan-level data to shed light on sectoral differences in the effects of fiscal consolidations.====Using a syndicated-loan data set covering 15 advanced economies from 1990 to 2014, we find that the cost of credit increases with fiscal consolidations (which we identify based on a narrative approach as in Romer and Romer, 2010). Loan spreads are higher for firms in sectors that are more directly affected by the fiscal consolidation measures, and especially for small firms, highly leveraged firms, firms that have limited access to international markets such as through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), domestic firms, and government-dependent firms. These findings indicate that banks ask for higher premiums from companies that have more exposure to specific fiscal measures or to domestic conditions.====We also find that the increase in loan spreads is mitigated substantially when consolidations are large. This evidence supports the view that agents find larger fiscal adjustments to be more credible and that they form positive expectations about future economic performance and sovereign default risk (Alesina and Ardagna, 2010). Consistent with this argument, we find that the mitigating effect of large consolidations disappears when sovereign risk is not high.====We then explore the implications of different fiscal policy measures by examining tax hikes and spending cuts. We find that corporate and property tax hikes are among the major drivers of higher cost of credit. This is perhaps because lenders price in reduced profitability and ability to repay debt due to increased tax burden on firms. Among government spending cuts, reductions in unemployment benefits and pensions increase credit spreads. This possibly captures an increased propensity to save, with implications for corporate profits, or an expectation that firms may end up bearing some of these costs, in the sense that a reduction in the net wage of workers leads to an increase in pre-tax real wages paid by firms (Alesina and Perotti, 1997). In contrast, value added tax (VAT) hikes and social benefit cuts, which are politically sensitive, are associated with lower cost of credit. These measures seem to be considered favorably, perhaps because they are deemed more credible or effective.==== Overall, a stronger adverse association between the cost of credit and tax measures, as opposed to spending measures, is in line with the related literature (e.g., Leigh et al., 2010; Alesina et al., 2015b).====Using loan-level rather than aggregate data allows us to provide a novel perspective by exploiting variation along the sectoral dimension. Some fiscal consolidation measures may have a disproportionate effect on the cost of credit to certain sectors. For example, lenders may price in consumption tax hikes for the retail sector more aggressively than for other firms. We consider hikes in consumption, bank, and health-care taxes, and cuts in transportation, health-care, and defense spending. Although we do not find any significant adverse effect of spending cuts on the cost of credit for directly affected sectors, we find that the cost of credit increases for firms in sectors that face tax hikes, that is, the banking sector with bank tax hikes, health-care sector with health-care tax hikes, and retail sector with VAT hikes.====These results indicate that lenders increase risk premiums for firms in sectors that experience tax hikes due to fiscal consolidation but not in those that experience spending cuts. The reason for this difference between tax and spending measures likely stems from the way they affect aggregate supply and demand (Alesina and Ardagna, 1998; Alesina et al., 2002). For tax increases, product and labor market distortions may lead firms to cut investment and labor demand. There is no offset to this effect on aggregate supply. For spending cuts, the initial drop in aggregate demand may be partially offset by an increase in private consumption and investment. This may happen because the reservation utility of workers goes down, reducing the private sector wage bill and, hence, improving profitability. The effect on demand may also be offset by reduced potential for crowding out by government spending.====The documented relations are not merely a reflection of the countercyclicality of credit spreads or of sovereign risk movements. Our empirical specifications control for contemporaneous gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Also, the coefficient on fiscal consolidation is virtually the same when we include the interaction between GDP growth and fiscal consolidation. In other words, credit spreads appear to increase with fiscal consolidations beyond what is implied by the instantaneous impact of fiscal consolidation on growth. Similarly, our empirical specifications control for sovereign risk indicators. Furthermore, the coefficient on fiscal consolidation remains positive and significant when we limit the sample to cases where sovereign risk is not elevated. This evidence indicates that the effect of fiscal consolidation on the cost of credit operates independently of the sovereign risk premium transmission channel.====The results are not driven solely by crises, a change in future growth expectations, or a reduction in policy uncertainty. As noted earlier, the credibility channel plays a role. Yet, excluding crisis episodes or adding forward-looking indicators of growth and policy uncertainty as controls does not materially alter the coefficient on fiscal consolidation.====Then there may be another channel in operation, and our analysis of sectoral differences offers additional insights into the transmission mechanism of fiscal consolidation to corporate credit spreads. Specifically, we do not find any robust evidence of a differential effect of specific taxes on the directly affected sectors during large fiscal consolidations. Taken together with the other cross-firm, cross-fiscal measure, and cross-sector evidence, this indicates that fiscal consolidations may increase corporate borrowing costs through the distortionary effects of taxes disproportionately affecting small, domestic, less diversified, and financially constrained firms.====Examining the cost of credit in relation to fiscal consolidation poses several challenges. First, it is not straightforward to determine the direction of causality, as policy actions may be in reaction to current economic and financial developments. Our setup offers some latitude to address this challenge. Our use of individual loan-level data may alleviate reverse causality issues because it is less likely that the government chooses fiscal consolidation policies based on the spreads faced by particular firms on their bank loans.==== This concern is further mitigated by focusing on fiscal policy actions taken to reduce government debt, following the treatment in Romer and Romer (2010), where the motivation is clear and the action is not a reaction to current economic conditions. These fiscal policy actions may still be in response to an ongoing financial crisis (they may be exogenous to the business cycle but not to the financial conditions)—a concern we address by confirming that the main results hold when crisis episodes are excluded from the sample and when only countries with low sovereign debt levels are considered.====Second, a latent factor may be driving both fiscal policy actions and corporate loan spreads. Micro-level data allow inclusion of an extensive set of firm- and country-level controls to mitigate this concern.==== Importantly, the evidence that tax hikes related to certain sectors increase loan spreads mainly in those sectors suggests that causality runs from fiscal policies to cost of credit, and the findings are not a consequence of a latent factor.====Third challenge is related to the timing of policy actions and the response of the corporate loan market. We focus on fiscal policy actions carried out over the course of a year. The exact timing of these actions within that year cannot be pinned down in most cases because consolidation packages often involve multiple measures that kick in at different dates. Thus, we look at how spreads on loans issued within a given year vary with fiscal policy actions taken in that year. Although using an annual data set creates some imprecision in terms of timing and establishing the direction of causality, we confirm that the results are robust to this timing treatment.====Finally, by focusing on loan spreads, we are inherently looking at firms that applied for and were granted loans. However, fiscal policy actions may lead firms not to apply for loans; therefore, there may be a sample-selection bias. Robustness tests using Heckman (1979) selection model confirm that our results are not driven by sample selection.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine how the cost of corporate credit varies with detailed fiscal policy measures implemented explicitly to reduce government debt. By taking advantage of the rich data regarding variation in loan, firm, industry, and fiscal policy characteristics, we shed light on the implications of different fiscal policy measures for different corporations and sectors.====Our paper contributes to the literature along three main dimensions. First, we focus on firm- and loan-level data rather than country-level aggregate data, and we consider the details of fiscal consolidation packages. This allows us to examine how fiscal policies affect the credit conditions of different corporations and, in doing so, offers an alternative identification for fiscal consolidation shocks.==== In particular, splitting the sample and examining the effects of sector-specific fiscal measures isolate differential reactions that provide additional insights and are unlikely to be the result of exogenous output shocks that led to the consolidation action.====Second, we look at credit markets rather than bond markets. This adds to our knowledge of the financial market effects of fiscal policies. Importantly, some corporations may not have access to bond markets whereas bank borrowing is a major source of funding for a large number of firms.==== Thus, we can observe the effects of fiscal consolidation on an important financing source for corporations. Furthermore, the effects of fiscal consolidation on credit markets may be different from those on bond markets. For example, Becker and Ivashina (2014) show a substitution effect between bond and loan markets driven by bank lending conditions. Such substitution may drive a firm facing higher credit spreads due to fiscal consolidation into the bond market, consistent with our finding that it is mainly the spreads for firms without access to bond markets that are adversely affected. Firms that have access to bond markets do not experience an increase in credit spreads in response to fiscal consolidations, in line with the literature that focuses on bond markets (Ardagna, 2009; Laubach, 2009).==== Also, whereas Ardagna (2009) and Laubach (2009) look at interest rates on corporate bonds, we focus on the corporate loan spreads over the benchmark rate. Although interest rates on corporate bonds may indicate movements in benchmark rates, spreads over benchmark rates are closely related to the market perceptions of credit risk.====Third, we shed light on the transmission mechanism of fiscal consolidation. Specifically, our analysis shows that fiscal consolidation may affect corporate borrowing costs independently of aggregate demand changes and sovereign risk movements. Furthermore, exploiting granular information on the composition of consolidation and variation across sectors allows us to reveal that this additional, second-order channel likely operates through the distortionary impact of taxes on constrained firms.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the syndicated loan market and the channels through which fiscal consolidation may have a bearing on corporate borrowing costs. Section 3 explains the data and the empirical approach. Section 4 presents and discusses the results on the relation between the cost of credit and the fiscal consolidations driven by government debt reduction.

We find that although import competition reduces jobs, export expansion also creates a substantial number of jobs. At the ==== level, job gains due to US export expansion largely offset job losses due to Chinese import competition, resulting in a net gain of 379 thousand jobs over 1991–2011 in our preferred estimate. At the commuting zone level, job gains and losses are roughly balanced, with a slight net loss of 68 thousand jobs and a substantial range around this preferred estimate depending on the specification.","Conventional wisdom in economics is that trade liberalization will have two effects on labor market outcomes. On the one hand, firms that face import competition may shrink or even exit and therefore displace workers. On the other hand, firms that gain access to foreign market should enter or expand, therefore generating new jobs. While such effects of job creation and destruction due to international trade are commonly accepted, the recent growing literature on the ‘China shock’ focuses on the job-reducing effect of surging imports from China or other low-wage countries on the US labor market (Autor et al., 2013; Pierce and Schott, 2016; Acemoglu et al., 2016).==== Much less explored is the job-creating effect of exports. Autor et al. (2013) begin to explore that issue by including ==== imports from China in their robustness analysis. Instead we shall consider total US exports as compared to imports from China and imports from the rest of the world.====Specifically, this paper provides one of the first accounts of job creation due to the export expansion in the United States, at the industry and the commuting zone levels. The United States is among the leading exporting countries in the world trading system: in 2014, the value of its merchandise exports reached more than 1.6 trillion US dollars, second only after China. Fig. 1 illustrates real merchandise exports and manufacturing exports for the US over 1991 to 2011 (in 2007 US dollars). It shows that either measure of US exports more than doubled over these two decades, from 600 billion or less in 1991 to more than 1.2 trillion dollars in 2011. No doubt such an expansion in export value generated increased demand for labor. However, the US export expansion was not evenly distributed across industries. Fig. 2 lists the top industries that have experienced the largest increase in export value during 1991 - 2007. Among 392 revised SIC manufacturing sectors, semiconductors experienced the largest increase in export value during 1991-1999, while motor vehicles and petroleum refining have been the champion of export expansion in the period 1999-2007.==== These top categories reflect America’s comparative advantage and grew much faster than many other categories, some of which even saw reductions in exports, therefore creating large variation for our estimation.====Empirically, it is not easy to obtain unbiased estimates of the effects of export expansion due to endogeneity. While increased access to foreign markets drives up demand for labor employment, domestic supply shocks such as new technology or TFP growth will also promote exports, and quite possibly reduce employment, causing difficulty in identification. Uncontrolled (often unobserved) domestic demand shocks, too, can be expected to affect export value and labor employment simultaneously. Lack of plausible instruments probably explains the limited empirical evidence on the employment effects of both exports and imports.====To deal with endogeneity, we adopt two instruments. First, we follow the spirit of Autor et al. (2013), henceforth ADH to look at the export expansion of eight other high-income countries.==== This is based on the assumption that these high-income countries face similar demand shocks for their sales into foreign countries as does the United States in its exports to those countries. The second instrument that we adopt in this paper relies on a more careful modeling of US exports to each foreign market, based on a CES framework. The export equation that we obtain includes a term that captures the exports of other countries to each foreign market (similar to our first instrument), and in addition, it includes the tariffs faced by the United States and all other countries selling in that market. Thus, we construct a second instrument as the predicted US exports based on foreign demand (except from the US), tariffs that the US faces, and the tariffs that other competing countries face in each foreign market. We likewise use two instruments on the import side: the first is the ADH instrument based on the eight other countries imports (from China or the rest of the world), and the second is predicted US imports incorporating its own change in tariffs, especially the establishment of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China after its accession to the WTO in 2001, as analyzed by Pierce and Schott (2016) and Handley and Limao (2017).====On the import side, we find that both the ADH instrument and tariffs used in our second instrument, reflecting China’s PNTR status within the US, perform very well in the first-stage regressions. That is, both these instruments contribute to the identification of US imports from China. Interestingly, however, adding the tariff information does not have a substantial further effect on the employment losses due to US imports from China. This finding suggests that the ADH instrument based on China’s exports to other countries already incorporates the effects of its WTO accession, in addition to other policy changes in China such as reform of state-owned enterprises, etc. All these changes create a quasi-natural experiment that ADH exploit to measure the ‘China shock’. In contrast, the analogous instrument on the export side to that used by ADH, which is the export expansion of eight other high-income countries, does not strongly identify US exports to China, and neither does China’s own tariff cuts. US exports to the rest of the world are better identified when using the eight other countries exports to the rest of the world and those tariff changes, but still, there is not the large-scale policy reform at work that we rely on to identify Chinese imports.====With this qualification in mind, our empirical results show important job gains due to US export expansion. Based on the industry level estimation, our preferred results show that US export expansion to the world ==== import penetration from China and the rest of the world actually led to a net gain of 497,000 jobs in the first decade of 1991-1999, while it led to a net loss of 117,000 jobs for the second period 1999–2011. Over the entire 1991-2011 period, therefore, job gains largely offset job losses, with a net gain of 379,000 jobs. While these results put the job losses created by Chinese imports into a useful perspective, a second qualification is that the job gains and losses can occur in different geographic locations, so incorporating exports does not eliminate the localized job losses and gains that occur in different regions.====To investigate these localized job gains and losses, we also explore the variations across US commuting zones in their exposure to imports and exports. . We find consistently a large job creating effect of export expansion (but with the same qualification just noted, that these gains can occur in different commuting zones than the job losses). In the first period, our preferred specification shows that job gains from export expansion largely offset the job losses from import penetration, resulting in a net gain of 379,000 jobs (just like we find for the entire period in the industry estimates). In the second period, export expansion continues to create large gains around 1200,000 jobs, however, due to the large job losses from import penetration, this leads to a net loss of 447,000 jobs. Over the entire 1991-2011 period, this leads to a slight net loss of 68,000 jobs. Other specifications using alternative instruments or the estimation method of Borusyak et al., 2018 lead to estimates that vary substantially around that preferred specification.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces our empirical strategy, the specifications we use and the two types of instruments we construct. Section 3 presents the estimation results at the industry level and the quantitative employment implications. Section 4 introduces the analysis at the local commuting zone level.

Contrary to existing studies, we use a search-and-matching setting that allows to endogenize the employment structure and the wage differentials between different skill groups in the same sector, and between workers with identical skills employed in different sectors. Theoretically, the brain drain induces ambiguous welfare effects for those left behind as the potential loss/gain depends on the parameters of the model. We thus parameterize our model on 33 sub-Saharan African countries and produce comparative results for each of them. We find that skilled emigration induces heterogeneous welfare losses for the low-skilled population. The size of these losses varies between 0.2 and 8%, and is influenced by the parameters of the production and education technologies. The results are fairly robust to identifying assumptions, to the inclusion of technological externalities, and to the endogenization of training decisions.","How does skilled emigration affect development and the welfare of those left behind? This question has been the source of repeated and controversial statements in the literature for about the last fifty years. The reasons why skilled emigration can hurt development in poor countries are well established. Nearly one in four college-educated adults born in a low-income country now live in the developed world; this human capital flight may deprive the sending country of the necessary resources to drive economic growth, to provide key public services, and to articulate calls for greater democracy. Yet, a more recent strand of literature has identified positive spin-offs from skilled emigration. These include positive effects of emigration prospects on education decisions, remittances, or diaspora externalities (Docquier and Rapoport 2012). Given the lack of clear empirical relationship between human capital and development, other studies have challenged the view that human capital losses induce economic and welfare costs in the sending countries (Clemens 2015). Consequently, the economic implications of the brain drain are still uncertain. A better understanding of the relationships between brain drain, human capital and development is necessary before getting to the bottom of the dilemmas that the brain drain poses.====In this paper, we model these relationships using a one good, two-class (low-skilled and high-skilled), two-sector model with a formal and an informal labor market. The informal economy captures activities that are not taxed, monitored by any form of government, or included in official statistics, but that lead to economic transactions between agents. It represents about 40% of the recorded gross domestic product (GDP) in low-income countries, and attracts more than 50% of the labor force (Schneider 2005).==== Informal activities are mainly characterized by low-skilled intensive technologies and provide a precious source of income to those who cannot find a job in the formal economy. By draining many low-skilled workers, informality changes the skill structure of the labor force in the formal sector, and limits the size of the labor market interactions between the highly skilled and the less educated. The informal sector also drains some high-skilled workers who cannot find regular jobs in accordance with their qualifications.==== Acting as a buffer, informality attenuates or neutralizes the economic effects of emigration-driven changes in human capital; this may be why returns to schooling, low-skilled wages and GDP per worker poorly respond to human capital changes in poor countries (Clemens 2015; Docquier et al. 2017). Yet, the labor market interactions between the formal and informal sectors are badly understood.====Some models assume competitive labor markets and perfect mobility of workers between sectors. Most of them fail to explain (i) why a large income differential exists between sectors, (ii) why informality attracts workers from all skill groups, or (iii) why some workers are involuntarily trapped in the informal sector.==== Several mechanisms can be used to generate a wage differential between sectors in the competitive labor market setting (such as unobserved heterogeneity in workers' abilities, or a differential in risk, in exposure to rent-seeking, etc.). However, it is difficult to explain the observed patterns of informality using the competitive paradigm as the latter neither accounts for involuntary informal employment, nor for the relationship between endogenous job creation in the formal economy and equilibrium wage rates. This paper proposes an alternative search-and-matching model ==== Pissarides (2000), which is compatible with two facts above, and which accounts for endogenous job creation by formal firms. We use it to study how the brain drain affects the welfare of those left behind, with or without positive spin-offs from emigration. We parameterize our model on 33 sub-Saharan African economies (i.e., countries exhibiting large differences in emigration rates between skill groups and where the brain drain is more likely to be detrimental to those left behind). Accounting for country-specific characteristics, we produce comparative estimates of the welfare and inequality effects of the brain drain.====In the first part of the study we show that under a competitive formal labor market and free mobility between sectors (as in Docquier et al. 2017), the brain drain has no impact on wage rates and inequality. The effects are totally absorbed by changes in informal employment, which acts as a perfect buffer zone at low levels of development. Nevertheless, our competitive economy fails to explain the observed patterns of informality and wage differential across the two sectors. Then, in the second part of the study, we add search frictions and endogenize the wage differentials across sectors as well as involuntary informal employment using a search-and-matching model. The search-and-matching framework endogenizes wages and it incorporates the effect of brain drain on job creation. This assists in analyzing the changes in the size of the informal sector, and in endogenizing income disparities between sectors for each skill group.====In our model, skilled emigration not only affects the marginal productivity of low-skilled and high-skilled workers in the home country. It also influences the duration and profitability of a vacancy, the process of job creation in the formal sector, and the outside options of workers. Hence, wage responses are not only due to changes in marginal productivity, but also to changes in outside options through changes in market tightness. Our model also rationalizes the presence of highly skilled workers employed in the informal economy, their share, as well as the wage gap between sectors. Theoretically, we show that the effects of brain drain on informality and inequality depends upon the degree of substitution between low and high-skilled workers along the production chain. Under a large degree of substitution, brain drain decreases inequality. On the contrary, if the elasticity of substitution between the two skill groups is small, brain drain most likely increases inequality and impoverishes the low skilled.====Turning to the comparative quantitative analysis, our benchmark version of the model disregards any form of technological or educational externality. In this context, high-skilled wages increase almost linearly with emigration, while the wage losses for the low skilled considerably vary across countries. In particular, they depend on the education technology and on the productivity gap between sectors. Countries with better education technology and smaller productivity gap lose more in terms of income, formal employment and inequality. The results are more pessimistic if total factor productivity increases with the average level of schooling in the home country. On the contrary, allowing productivity to increase with the diaspora abroad induces slightly smaller labor market responses. It is worth emphasizing that we focus on domestic income and labor market outcomes, disregarding the effect of remittances. The latter only represent 2 to 2.5% of domestic income in low-income countries and their distribution across skill groups is badly documented (both among donors and recipients). In another extension of the model, we endogenize social mobility and account for brain gain effects in line with Mountford (1997) and Beine et al. (2008). A growing empirical literature shows that incentives for human capital accumulation in developing countries are based to a significant extent on migration opportunities.==== We assume education is privately funded and disregard the fiscal impact of education and emigration, as well as the role of credit constraints.==== The income loss due to the brain drain is reduced by about 20% for the low-skilled when the model is calibrated to match the estimated elasticity of training decisions to skilled migration prospects. Nevertheless, our qualitative findings remain robust.====This paper is at the crossroad of three strands of literature. The first is the literature on ====. It started in the 1960s with the works of Grubel and Scott (1966) or Berry and Soligo (1969), which confront the negative and positive implications of the brain drain for the sending countries. Then, the theoretical literature of the 1970s and 1980s mainly focuses on the negative effects linked to the actual loss of human capital and to high-skilled emigration prospects. The mechanisms include labor market effects, fiscal losses, and later, the aggregate productivity responses (Bhagwati and Hamada 1974; Bhagwati and Rodriguez 1975; Rodriguez 1975; McCulloch and Yellen 1977; Miyagiwa, 1991; Haque and Kim 1995). A newer wave of studies has emerged since the mid-nineties; it discusses the ambiguous effects of the brain drain on human capital accumulation (Mountford 1997; Stark et al., 1997, Stark et al., 1998; Beine et al., 2001, Beine et al., 2008) and highlights other externalities due to the presence of a diaspora abroad (Docquier and Rapoport 2012). The main contribution of the new literature is that it is evidence-based, something which was not possible until recently due to the lack of decent comparative data on international migration by educational attainment. Empirical works show that the brain drain can generate beneficial economic effects for those left behind, especially when the degree of positive selection in emigration is not too large. Our approach accounts for most of the ingredients of this literature. In our quantitative analysis, we focus on a set of countries where the propensity to emigrate of high-skilled is much larger than that of the low-skilled, which reduces the likelihood of a net brain gain outcome.====The second strand of literature investigates the relationship between ====. Informality can generate vicious circles through different channels. de Paula and Scheinkman, 2010, de Paula and Scheinkman, 2011 emphasize the role of value-added taxes in transmitting informality through chain effects – the informality of a firm is correlated with the informality of firms from which it buys or sells. In Zenou (2008) and Leal Ordonez (2014), informality reduces the amount of fiscal revenues that the government can allocate to social protection; in turn, this affects the attractiveness of the formal economy through greater tax rates or smaller social benefits. Murphy et al. (1989) or Krugman (1991) model firms' choice to operate formally or informally; due to fixed costs of entry, operating formally is profitable if the demand for the goods produced is large enough (i.e., when other firms industrialize and pay higher wages). In these frameworks, the predominance of informality can be seen as a result of a coordination failure. In a dynamic framework, Docquier et al. (2017) investigate the link between informality, education decisions and long-run growth. By absorbing a large share of the low-skilled labor force, the informal sector limits the skill premium in the formal sector; in addition, it facilitates child labor. Faced with lower skill premia and easier access to child labor, parents tend to choose less schooling for their children. Informality can slow down this convergence process or it can be the source of a poverty trap. The quantitative analysis reveals that the case for the poverty trap is stronger. Our model shares many ingredients with the latter study, but formalizes labor movements between the formal and informal sectors using a search-and-matching framework.====The third strand is the literature on ==== (Ortega 2000; Yashiv 2000; Gong and van Soest 2002; Satchi and Temple 2009). Search-and-matching models à la Pissarides (2000) are widely used to study issues related to labor markets as they are considered to be based on more realistic assumptions.==== The standard model assumes that the labor markets are not centralized, and that there exists no single price that is accepted by large number of buyers and sellers in labor market for trading. Instead, there are periods of involuntary unemployment and job search for workers. The wage rate is not equal to the marginal product of labor; there are profits and the marginal product of labor is shared by firms and workers. The income shares of workers and firms are decided through bargaining. On the other hand, firms incur costs for maintaining vacancies.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model with exogenous total factor productivity levels and education decisions, discusses its parameterization, and quantifies the effect of the brain drain in sub-Saharan Africa. Section 3 discusses extensions with endogenous total factor productivity levels and human capital accumulation. Finally, Section 4 concludes.","Brain drain, informality and inequality: A search-and-matching model for sub-Saharan Africa",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618303738,23 May 2019,2019,Research Article,233.0

The results and theorems on the aggregate gains from trade in Dixit and Norman, 1980, Dixit and Norman, 1986 have been extended by Arkolakis et al. (2012), Costinot et al. (2012) and Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014).==== Concurrently, there has also been a renewed interest in the distribution of those gains. These are the focus of Porto (2006), Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016), Atkin and Donaldson (2015), and Atkin et al. (2018).==== In this paper, we combine these two questions and assess the income gains relative to the inequality costs of trade policy. Using survey data for 54 developing countries, we explore the potential trade-off between the gains from trade and the distribution of those gains and we provide a quantification of the inequality-adjusted welfare gains from trade. The evaluation of this trade-off is important, especially because free trade is often opposed on inequality grounds.====We develop a comprehensive model that describes how trade policy affects the real income of different households. Tariffs determine domestic prices which affect households both as consumers and as income earners. As consumers, households are affected through the cost of the entire bundle of traded consumption goods. Similarly, household income is affected through changes in the returns to household production activities, crop growing, family businesses, labor earnings, and government transfers. Our model encompasses all these mechanisms. Following Deaton (1989), we use a first-order approximation to measure how changes in tariffs impact real income.====We then combine tariff data on various goods with household survey data on detailed income and expenditure patterns to estimate these first order welfare effects for 54 low and middle income countries. With estimates of the welfare effects of import tariff liberalization for each household, we study the aggregate gains from trade (as in Arkolakis et al., 2012) and the distribution of the gains from trade (as in Porto, 2006). Using an Atkinson Social Welfare function (Atkinson, 1970), we assess the trade-off between the income gains and the inequality costs of trade. Our joint study of the gains from trade and their distribution across households contributes to an incipient strand of literature including Antras et al. (2017) and Galle et al. (2017).====It is useful to put our methodological approach into context. Arkolakis et al. (2012) quantify the aggregate gains from trade by deriving a sufficient statistic to compare autarky with the status quo. Subsequent literature has developed extensions allowing for imperfect competition (Arkolakis et al., 2019), labor market frictions (Caliendo et al., 2019), and productivity advantages (Melitz and Redding, 2015). Work on the distributional effects identifies instead winners and losers from trade. Much of this literature builds on Deaton's (1989) first-order effects approach. Porto (2006) studies the distribution of the household welfare effects across the income distribution, Nicita et al. (2014) explore the poverty bias of trade policy (the welfare effects of the poor relative to the welfare effects of the rich), and Atkin et al. (2018) investigate the distribution of the household welfare effects from FDI. Another branch of the literature examines distributional effects in an Arkolakis et al. (2012) setting. Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) introduce non-homothetic preferences and focus on expenditures only. Costinot et al. (2012) and Galle et al. (2017) adopt a Ricardo-Roy model and focus on both expenditures and wages.====A distinctive feature of this paper is that we merge these two approaches by looking at both average gains from trade and their distributional impacts. As is standard in the literature, we rely on first order approximations. We offer a flexible model with extensive household heterogeneity in incomes and expenditures. As in Nicita et al. (2014), we allow for a more comprehensive set of sources of income heterogeneity than in most other papers. As in Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016), we allow for non-homothetic preferences and heterogeneity in expenditure patterns. To operationalize this flexible framework, we need to impose some structure on our model. Our setting is compatible with perfect competition, constant returns to scale, and homogeneous products.====We find average income gains from import tariff liberalization in 45 countries and average income losses in the remainder 9 countries. On average, the developing countries in our study enjoy gains from trade equivalent to 1.9% of real household expenditure. This is mostly because the consumption gains from lower prices dominate the income losses from reduced protection.====The distributional impacts of import tariff liberalization are highly heterogeneous, across both countries and households. We find that the equality gains, the change in social welfare associated with these distributional impacts, are negatively correlated with the average income gains. Inequality costs arise primarily because trade exacerbates nominal income inequality, while the consumption gains tend to be more evenly spread. This creates trade-offs between the income gains and the equality gains in 45 of the 54 countries in our sample. The income gains typically more than offset the increase in inequality. In 39 countries, liberalization of import tariffs would result in inequality-adjusted welfare gains for a wide range of empirically plausible values of inequality aversion (between 1 and 2). In 9 countries that face trade-offs, protectionism would instead be welfare enhancing for plausible values of inequality aversion. Finally, there are 6 countries where the trade-offs are acute, in which the presence of welfare gains or losses depends crucially on the presumed level of inequality aversion and policy prescriptions are consequently more equivocal. These results imply that in the majority of developing countries in our study, the prevailing pattern of protection induces sizeable welfare losses.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the model and derives the formulas for the welfare effects of trade policy. Section 3 uses the tariff data and the survey data to estimate those welfare effects in 54 countries. Section 4 discusses the gains from trade and their distribution. Section 5 evaluates and quantifies the trade-off between income gains and inequality costs of trade. It also decomposes equality gains into consumption equality gains and income equality gains, presents robustness tests, and assesses the trade-offs that would arise if countries were to undertake protectionist trade reforms instead of liberalizing.

In a two-country model where trade costs allow for international market segmentation, we show that endogenous pricing-to-market behavior of firms acts as an important transmission channel of the policies. By strengthening the degree of competition between firms, product market deregulation at home leads to a reduction in domestic markups, which generally leads to an improvement in the international competitiveness of the Home country. Conversely, the power of competitive tax policy to depreciate the ==== is dampened, as domestic firms take the opportunity of the labor tax cut to increase their markups. The variability of markups also affects the normative implications of the reforms. This indicates the importance of taking into account endogenous pricing-to-market behavior when intending to correctly evaluate the overall effects of the reforms.","The severity of the recession that hit a large number of countries over the last decade forced policy-makers and economists to evaluate the structural fragilities that have become apparent in developed countries throughout the 2000s. Current account imbalances and sustained real exchange appreciation have notably been pointed out as serious failures for the peripheral euro-zone countries (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2011). Accordingly, the literature attests to a renewed interest in studying the effects of fiscal and/or structural policies on external imbalances. Playing on the fiscal tool has thus been studied as a way of depreciating the real exchange rate in the short run (Farhi et al., 2014). Deregulating the goods market may also help firms compete on international markets (see Cacciatore et al. (2015a) for a survey).====In this paper, we investigate the channels through which policy reforms – such as product market deregulation or payroll tax cuts – affect the real exchange rate in the long run in a fully flexible price environment. As pointed out by several empirical studies, firms' pricing-to-market behavior (PTM hereafter) has key implications on the real exchange rate (see Burstein and Gopinath, 2014 for a survey). In this context, it is likely that the ability of a given reform to reduce prices depends on markup adjustments, which differ across destination markets in presence of international market segmentation. A main contribution to the existing literature is thus to shed light on the role of endogenous markup adjustments on the effectiveness of the reforms to affect international relative prices.====This question will be addressed on theoretical grounds. Precisely, we develop a two-country dynamic model with imperfect competition and endogenous firm entry, featuring international trade costs and sunk entry cost, close to Corsetti et al. (2007). With this framework, we capture two dimensions that have been shown to be key elements in shaping real exchange rate behavior, the relative price of exported goods and the relative number of exporters i.e. the extensive margin of trade (see the seminal contribution of Ghironi and Mélitz (2005)). This theoretical framework is further expanded to include a structure of oligopolistic competition that generates endogenous markups, in a similar way to that described by Atkeson and Burstein (2008). Further, international trade costs allow firms to discriminate across countries by charging different markups specific to the destination market. The markup extracted on each market can thus be shown to depend on two elements: First, the competition effect, i.e. on the number of competitors in the market. The lower the number of competitors, the lower the price elasticity of demand for a given variety, hence the higher the markup extracted by the producer. Due to the open economy structure, markups are also determined by the relative price effect: When imported varieties are more expensive than local ones, the price elasticity of demand for the goods produced at Home contracts, allowing domestic firms to extract higher markups. Markup adjustments are shown to serve as a major transmission channel of these reforms onto international relative prices. More precisely, we study the effects of the Home country implementing either a reform to alleviate the goods market entry cost (i.e. product market deregulation) or to reduce the labor tax wedge by switching from direct labor taxation to indirect consumption taxes (i.e. a competitive tax policy), contrasting the cases where markups are constant or endogenously adjusted to the economic policy. For our benchmark calibration, we find that a competitive tax policy is successful in improving international competitiveness through a permanent reduction in the terms of trade and a real exchange depreciation, while product market deregulation is not. Importantly, PTM behavior of firms is seen to play a key role in the propagation of both of the aforementioned reforms.====The underlying transmission mechanisms behind these results can be accounted for as follows: In the long run, the product market deregulation at Home improves the market position of domestic firms which has been seen to contribute to a real exchange depreciation, all other things being equal. Yet, this effect is counteracted by a rise in the relative labor cost at Home, which is detrimental to the price competitiveness of Home goods meaning that the terms of trade, i.e. the relative price of exports, go up. The competitive tax policy has an effect on firms' market share and terms of trade, but in the opposite direction, entailing a reduction in the relative unit labor cost at Home, to balance with a reduction in the relative number of country's domestic firms active on the world market. For our benchmark calibration, the relative labor cost effect dominates, such that a competitive tax policy engenders a real exchange rate depreciation while product market deregulation engenders an appreciation. These responses of international relative prices hold in the long run as well as throughout the transitional dynamics. Specifically, both reforms lead to an overshooting of the real exchange rate, as the magnitude of its immediate response is larger than its permanent one. This is attributable to the immediate adjustment of the labor cost contrasting with the sluggishness in firm entry.====A key contribution of the paper is to show the importance of the endogenous PTM behavior of firms as a propagation channel of both reforms. Precisely, endogenous markup adjustments dampen the impact of both reforms on international relative prices. The intuition is as follows: By reducing the entry cost, product market deregulation sets the competition effect in motion: A larger number of competitors on the domestic market exerts a downward pressure on the markups that can be extracted at Home. This, in turn, moderates the real exchange appreciation. By contrast, domestic firms take the opportunity of the labor tax cut to increase their markups, in particular on the local market. Under international goods market segmentation, markups extracted at Home increase more than abroad, which lessens the real exchange rate depreciation. Endogenous PTM also has implications in a normative perspective. While both reforms can have an effect of welfare improvement under constant markups, an allowance for endogenous PTM behavior amplifies the welfare gains of the competitive tax policy whilst reducing those of the product market deregulation in both countries. Viewed from different perspectives, our results thus point out the importance of taking into account the endogenous PTM behavior when intending to correctly evaluate the overall effects of the reforms.====Our paper contributes to the growing recent literature on the effects of fiscal and structural reforms in an open-economy setting. A first strand of the literature investigates the ability of fiscal policies to achieve the flexible-price allocation when the economy faces nominal rigidity and that the nominal exchange rate cannot adjust. Farhi et al. (2014) and Engler et al. (2017) study the effects of a fiscal devaluation in the short run, focusing on the intensive trade margin by leaving aside the issue of firm entry. Conversely, Auray et al. (2018) point out that it is also important to consider the effects of this tax policy on the extensive margin of trade. Studying the role of firm entry also lies at the heart of numerous papers investigating the effects of product market deregulation. Forni et al. (2010), Andrés et al. (2017) or Eggertsson et al. (2014) investigate the effects of product market deregulation in various open-economy contexts. However, they adopt a reduced form approach by modeling market deregulation by an exogenous markup reduction. Conversely, our paper shows the importance of taking into account the endogeneity of markup adjustment. Closest to us, Cacciatore et al., 2015a, Cacciatore et al., 2016b, Cacciatore et al., 2016a, Cacciatore et al., 2016c extensively study the open-economy effects of product market deregulation on interaction with monetary policy. In contrast to these papers, we abstract from nominal rigidities to study the effects of structural (and fiscal) reforms on real exchange rate adjustments under flexible prices, thereby adopting a long-run perspective. Further, while the literature has studied either product market deregulation or labor tax policy as two distinct phenomena, we study the two policies in a unified framework. Our results help to understand the transmission channels of those two reforms. In particular, we show the importance of taking into account the endogenous pricing behavior of firms on internationally segmented markets. In a two-country context close to ours, Bergin & Feenstra (2001), Corsetti & Dedola (2005) or Atkeson & Burstein (2008) point out the importance of the PTM behavior of firms to account for deviations from the law of one price and the imperfect exchange rate pass-through.==== Our paper differs from these others in two main aspects: First, we explicitly relate endogenous PTM decisions to firm entry in an international setup. In this respect, our study bridges a gap between Floetotto & Jaimovich (2008) (in a closed-economy framework) and Atkeson & Burstein (2008) (in a two-country model with exogenous firm entry), to show the importance of both the extent of competition between firms and the relative price effect as key determinants of markups. Second, we interrogate our supposition, focussing on how endogenous markups may affect the outcomes of structural/fiscal reforms.====The following section lays out the model. In Section 3, we evaluate the effects of the reforms on the determinants of the real exchange rate and the current account, both over the long run and the short run. In Section 4, we ensure the robustness of our results before extending the analysis to the welfare comparison in Section 5.

We develop a gradient-free method to compute the exact transition paths following a trade liberalization. We find that (i) larger countries accumulate a current account surplus, and financial resources flow from larger countries to smaller countries, boosting consumption in the latter, (ii) countries with larger short-run trade deficits accumulate capital faster, (iii) the gains are nonlinear in the reduction in trade costs, and (iv) capital accumulation accounts for substantial gains. The net foreign asset position before the liberalization is positively correlated with the gains. The ","How large are the welfare gains from trade? This is an old and important question. It has typically been answered in static settings by computing the change in real income from an observed equilibrium to a counterfactual equilibrium. In such computations, the factors of production and technology in each country are held fixed, and the change in real income is immediate and is entirely due to the change in each country's trade share that responds to a change in trade costs. Recent examples include Arkolakis et al. (2012) (ACR hereafter), who compute the welfare cost of autarky, and Waugh and Ravikumar (2016), who compute the welfare gains from frictionless trade.====By design, the above computations cannot distinguish between static and dynamic gains. The static gains accrue immediately after a trade liberalization, and there is no cost to increasing consumption. Dynamic gains, on the other hand, accrue gradually. For instance, capital accumulation is costly because it requires forgone consumption. Consumption smoothing motives imply that capital accumulation is gradual.====We calculate welfare gains from trade in a dynamic, multicountry Ricardian model where international trade affects the capital stock in each country in each period. Our environment is a version of Eaton and Kortum (2002) embedded in a two-sector neoclassical growth model, similar to Alvarez (2017). There is a continuum of tradable intermediate goods that are used in the production of investment goods, final consumption goods, and intermediate goods. Each country is endowed with an initial stock of capital. Investment goods augment the stock of capital. We add two features that affect the gains: (i) cross-country heterogeneity in the tradables intensity in investment goods and in consumption goods and (ii) endogenous trade imbalances. The first feature affects the cross-country heterogeneity in the rate of capital accumulation after a trade liberalization and, hence, the gains from trade. The second feature helps each country smooth its consumption over time and, hence, affects the gains.====We calibrate the tradables intensity using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). We calibrate productivities and trade costs so that the steady state of the model reproduces the observed bilateral trade flows across 44 countries and the trade imbalances in each country. We then conduct a counterfactual exercise in which there is an unanticipated, uniform, and permanent 20% reduction in trade costs in all countries. We compute the exact levels of endogenous variables along the transition path from the calibrated steady state to the counterfactual steady state and calculate the welfare gains using a consumption-equivalent measure as in Lucas (1987). Welfare gains from the trade liberalization accrue gradually in our model, and our measure of gains includes the entire transition path.====We find that (i) the current account balance immediately after the liberalization is positively correlated with size—larger countries accumulate a current account surplus, and financial resources flow from larger countries to smaller countries; (ii) the half-life for capital accumulation is negatively correlated with short-run trade deficits—countries with larger short-run trade deficits accumulate capital faster; (iii) gains from trade are nonlinear—the ==== of gains with respect to reductions in trade costs is higher for larger reductions; (iv) dynamic gains are 80% of steady-state gains; and (v) dynamic gains are 35% more than static gains.====Trade liberalization affects the gains in our model through two channels: total factor productivity (TFP) and the capital-labor ratio. The TFP channel is a familiar one in trade models. Trade liberalization results in a decline in the home trade share and, hence, an increase in TFP, which increases output. This channel affects the level of consumption along the transition. Resources flow to countries that experience a larger increase in TFP. These countries run a current account deficit in the short run and use it to finance increases in consumption and investment that exceed increases in output. In general, small countries run current account deficits and large countries run current account surpluses in the short run. The current account dynamics imply that larger countries backload consumption, whereas smaller countries frontload consumption.====Trade liberalization also increases the rate of capital accumulation as higher TFP boosts the returns to capital. As a result, capital accumulates, yielding higher output and consumption along the transition path. The increase in the capital-labor ratio is gradual, as in the neoclassical growth model.==== In addition, trade liberalization increases the rate of capital accumulation due to the decrease in the price of tradables. In our model, investment goods production is tradables intensive and higher intensity implies a larger response of the capital-labor ratio to trade liberalization. This channel also affects consumption along the transition path. In a static model, the capital-labor ratio channel is clearly absent.====The tradables intensity in each sector plays an important role in our model. After a trade liberalization, the tradables intensity in investment goods production determines the transition path for capital and has little effect on TFP dynamics, while the tradables intensity in consumption goods determines the transition path of TFP and has little effect on the dynamics of capital. Furthermore, investment goods production is typically more tradables intensive than consumption goods production, and countries with a larger difference between the two intensities experience a larger decrease in the relative price of investment and a larger increase in the investment rate. This result is similar to the findings in Mutreja et al. (2018), who examine the role of this channel on economic development in a model where there is no cross-country heterogeneity in the intensities.====We provide a fast computational method for solving multicountry trade models with large state spaces. The state variables in our model include capital stocks as well as net foreign asset (NFA) positions. Our algorithm iterates on prices using excess demand equations and delivers the entire transition path for 44 countries in approximately 30 min on a standard computer (see also Alvarez and Lucas, 2007). Our algorithm uses gradient-free updating rules that are faster than the nonlinear solvers used in recent dynamic models of trade (e.g., Eaton et al., 2016; Kehoe et al., 2018).====Our paper is related to three papers on multicountry models with capital accumulation: Alvarez (2017), Eaton et al. (2016), and Anderson et al. (2015).==== In a model with period-by-period balanced trade, Alvarez (2017) approximates the dynamics by linearizing around the counterfactual steady state. Our computational method provides an exact dynamic path and is more accurate for computing transitional dynamics for large trade liberalizations. In addition, there is a propagation from trade imbalances to capital accumulation in our model: Countries with a trade deficit accumulate capital faster after a trade liberalization, and changes in current rates of capital accumulation affect future trade imbalances which, in turn, affect future rates of capital accumulation. Thus, the steady-state capital stock depends on the current account dynamics. Hence, similar to other models with trade imbalances, the counterfactual steady state cannot be determined independently from the initial steady state and transition.====Eaton et al. (2016) examine the collapse of trade during the 2008 recession. They quantify the roles of different shocks via counterfactuals by solving the planner's problem, where the Pareto weight for each country is its share in world consumption expenditures and is the same in the benchmark and in the counterfactual. We solve for the competitive equilibrium and find that each country's consumption share changes in the counterfactual. For example, Bulgaria's share increases, whereas the U.S. share decreases.====Anderson et al. (2015) compute transitional dynamics in a model where the investment rate does not depend on trade costs and can be computed once and for all as a constant pinned down by the structural parameters. The transition path can then be computed as a solution to a sequence of static problems. In our model, current allocations and prices depend on the entire path of prices and trade costs. Hence, we have to simultaneously solve a system of second-order, nonlinear difference equations. Empirically, Wacziarg and Welch (2008) show an increase in the investment rate after trade liberalizations for a sample of 118 countries, which is consistent with our model's implication.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 describes the calibration, and Section 4 reports the results for counterfactuals. Section 5 explores the roles of capital accumulation and intensities of tradables.

The notion is that a set of common factors, notably “push” factors from advanced countries (ACs), drives financial conditions in a large set of countries. Although the specific factors identified and their importance vary across studies, a consensus has emerged that US monetary policy, the supply of global liquidity (especially in US dollars), and global risk aversion help explain the synchronization of capital flows (see among others, Milesi-Ferretti and Tille, 2011; Shin, 2012; Rey, 2013; Cerutti et al., 2017).==== But global factors do not affect capital flows to all countries equally. Yet, little is known about the characteristics leading to the differential effect of global (“push”) factors on capital flows to individual countries.====This lack of knowledge is highlighted by how capital flows to individual countries respond to large common shocks. While, for example, many emerging markets (EMs) experienced outflows during the sudden (and unexpected) deterioration in global financial conditions related to the so-called taper tantrum of May 2013, some were much more affected than others (Sahay et al., 2014).==== This episode, and others that saw differentiation among EMs in terms of their exposure to global shocks, naturally raise the question of what explains this heterogeneity. Why are some countries more sensitive in their gross inflows to global factors than others? Put differently, when global economic and financial conditions change, why are some countries more likely to lose (or gain) relatively more inflows?====In this paper, we tackle this question in two steps. First, to identify common dynamics, we conduct a systematic analysis of the degree of co-movements in gross capital inflows to 21 ACs and 33 EMs by using quarterly balance of payments (BOP) data for the period 2001–2015, and breaking the capital inflows by type (e.g. FDI, equity, bond, and other flows). We use a latent factor model in the spirit of Kose et al. (2003) to extract the common dynamics in gross inflows, distinguishing between global factors affecting all countries and factors affecting sub-groups (e.g., country groupings by income level or region). Using a latent factor approach provides a very general way of identifying commonality in flows. It also avoids having to determine which specific factors may drive the commonality.====This analysis confirms several findings of the literature on co-movements in capital inflows. First, we confirm that strong co-movement is generally an EM phenomenon. Specifically, we find no clear “global factor” driving inflows to all countries, i.e., EMs and ACs combined. Rather, co-movement among capital inflows occurs largely among EMs, and for which we can identify very precisely common factors. In contrast, common factors for inflows to ACs are much less precisely estimated. This suggests that structural differences affect how lenders and investors consider ACs versus EMs. Second, although co-movement is high for capital inflows to EMs, it varies greatly by type of flow. Specifically, bank-related inflows, portfolio bond, and equity inflows co-move across EMs, while FDI and flows to non-banks do not.==== These two findings qualify the notion of a global financial cycle affecting all types of flows to all countries and support the focus of the literature on (some types of) gross inflows to EMs.==== Third, we find that sensitivities to common factors vary across EMs and by type of flow. Whereas some EMs display very low sensitivity to common dynamics for all types of flows (equity, bond and bank), others, such as Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa, are highly sensitive to all types. Another group, which includes India, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Uruguay, displays a high sensitivity in only one or two types.==== This analysis supports the differentiation among EMs in periods of large global shocks (e.g. taper tantrum).====Second, we study how (macroeconomic and institutional) fundamentals and financial market characteristics relate to the observed cross-country heterogeneity of sensitivities to common factors. In this paper, we go beyond the variables typically used in the literature (such as the recipient's market size or openness) and investigate, in detail, the role of countries' investor bases in determining sensitivities to global factors. We analyze the inclusion of recipient markets in commonly used global equity and bond indices, such as the EMBI and MSCI indices, and the relative exposure of countries to global investors, especially global mutual funds (for bond and equity flows) and global banks (for bank-related flows). For the latter, building on the portfolio allocation literature, we develop a new metric – “global investor exposure”, which assesses for each EM whether global investors (global funds or banks) are “overweight” in a particular flow relative to total BOP flows in a given asset class.====The main part of our analysis reveals several important findings. First, we do not find as a general proposition that “good” fundamentals, such as high-quality institutions or low levels of public debt, tend to insulate countries from changes in global conditions. Only for portfolio bond inflows do we find that countries with higher levels of debt are more sensitive to the global factor, with this being largely driven by the period covering the global financial crisis (GFC). In contrast, liquidity of the recipient market, benchmark inclusion, and compositions of the investor base robustly explain the cross-country dispersion of the sensitivities of portfolio equity and debt flows. In particular, EMs that rely more heavily on global mutual funds exhibit a greater sensitivity of equity and bond inflows to the global factor. This higher sensitivity seems to be especially prevalent since the GFC and varies by type of mutual funds.====Our findings relate to several strands of the literature. First, although we rely on a different methodology, we are conceptually close to the literature on how global (“push”) factors determine capital flows (Calvo et al., 1993, Calvo et al., 1996, followed many others, e.g., Chuhan et al., 1998; Forbes and Warnock, 2012; Fratzscher, 2012; Broner et al., 2013; Ghosh et al., 2014; Bruno and Shin, 2015a, Bruno and Shin, 2015b; see Koepke, 2015 for a review). By using latent factors, rather than observed proxies, to capture the co-movement of capital flows, we avoid the problem of choosing specific factors, the significance of which has varied across studies and samples. Also, contrary to many others, our analysis largely relies on disaggregated flows. Besides highlighting heterogeneity across types of flows, our approach makes clear that countries are not universally and identically exposed to global factors. In fact, most EMs are sensitive to global factors through one or two types of flows only, explaining the focus of the literature on certain types of inflows to EMs.====Second, our findings on the roles of the investor base in affecting capital flow behavior relate to (more recent) research on the behavior of some types of global, non-resident investors. Using EPFR mutual fund-level data—which are a small subset of gross capital inflows, Raddatz and Sergio Schmukler (2012) and Puy (2016) show that these flows tend to be highly pro-cyclical. This is particularly true for EMs, with funds reducing (increasing) their exposure to countries when financial conditions deteriorate (improve) at home (i.e., in ACs), with seemingly little consideration for recipient countries' circumstances. Also using data on global mutual funds, Jotikasthira et al. (2012) show that funding shocks originating in AC-domiciled funds, can translate into fire sales (and purchases) for countries included in their portfolios, in particular for EMs. Also using EFPR mutual fund data, Fratzscher (2012) finds that common shocks to flows from these investors affect the cross-country dynamics in heterogeneous ways, reflecting varying macro and institutional fundamentals in recipient markets, with the results being strongest for EMs. More recently, Raddatz et al. (2017) find that inclusion in benchmarks (e.g., when a country enters the MSCI EM index) importantly affects equity and bond mutual fund portfolio allocations. Using confidential, security-level data for different types of German investors, Timmer (2018) shows that investment funds and banks exacerbate the price dynamics of foreign bonds by reacting pro-cyclically, in contrast to pension funds and insurance companies. Moreover, the fact that bank flows respond differently to global factors in periods of financial stress due to internal market and regulatory barriers is consistent with the evidence for specific episodes (e.g., Cerutti and Claessens, 2017). Our analysis complements these studies by considering broader sets of capital flows (all gross inflows, not just mutual fund inflows; and all investors, not just from a specific country) and showing how different investor bases can shape inflows' response to global factors.====Our findings that exposure to global investors, rather than institutional or macroeconomic fundamentals, affects how much countries can expect to receive (or lose) non-resident funding when global financial conditions improve (or deteriorate), does not mean that borrowers' fundamentals do not matter in shaping the other properties of capital inflows. As many papers have shown (e.g., Alfaro et al., 2008), countries with better macroeconomic or institutional fundamentals tend to receive more capital inflows. Different from this “level” effect, we find that countries' capital flow sensitivities to global factors are less affected by such fundamentals than by market structure characteristics.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

How do they respond to market incentives? Can we expect substantial efficiency gains from trade liberalization in economies with a strong presence of SOEs? Using a new dataset of Vietnamese firms we document a set of empirical regularities distinguishing SOEs from private firms. Then we empirically study the effect of the 2007 ,"In the major emerging economies, state owned enterprises (SOEs) still account for a substantial share of income and capital. Focusing on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's largest 2000 public companies and their 330,000 subsidiaries worldwide, a recent OECD study shows that SOE sales, market values, and assets account for a large share of the economy in BRIC countries (Kowalski et al., 2013).==== The strong presence of SOEs and the staggering recent success of these economies has triggered a new debate over “state capitalism” as a viable growth and development model (The Economist, 2012). Although they are at the center stage of this important debate, our understanding of this new form of enterprises is still in very limited. What do SOEs do? How do they respond, if at all, to market forces and reforms? Are they an obstacle or an engine of growth in a globalized economy? Using a new rich data set of Vietnamese firms, we first document a set of empirical regularities on SOEs operations and on those of private firms (POEs). Then, we examine the effect of large scale trade reform, the 2007 entry into the WTO, on selection, firm profitability, and productivity for both POEs and SOEs. Third, using a simple model of trade under firm heterogeneity in a small economy, we highlight how specific features of SOEs, regulatory/political barriers to entry and preferential access to credit, can shape the economic mechanisms driving their different response to trade. Specific tests provide empirical validations of these mechanisms.====Vietnam represents an ideal country for our research purposes, since more than one-third of its economy is still state owned and the WTO accession represents one of the largest market reforms, possibly the largest, in its history. We rely on data from the General Statistics Office (GSO), which covers the entire spectrum of Vietnamese firms over the period 2006–2012. Given that Vietnam was in a weak bargaining position in seeking accession to the WTO, MFN tariff cuts provide arguably exogenous variation in international exposure, as tariff rates fell from an average of 20% in 2006 to 8% in 2009, and varied extensively across industries. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we directly estimate the impact of the reduction in Vietnam's Most Favored National (MFN) tariffs on the probability of exit of private firms in comparison to SOEs. We also assess the impact of MFN cuts on firm profitability. In addition to analysis at the firm level, we study the impact of MFN cuts on average productivity at the industry level, exploiting the cross-industry variation of SOEs' presence. The main econometric challenge is that private firms are likely to differ from SOEs in many characteristics, which could also affect their probability of entering and exiting the market. We account for this source of heterogeneity by using entropy balancing to establish a reasonable comparison group between POEs and SOEs with respect to a battery of firm-level and industry-level confounding factors. In addition, we saturate our models with a large number of fixed effects (including firm fixed effects) to account for possible confounding factors and industry specific time trends to mitigate concerns about the violation of the parallel trend assumption.====Our econometric analysis produces the following empirical findings. First, we only find strong evidence of trade-induced selection for POEs and less so for SOEs: Private firms are significantly more likely to exit the market compared to SOEs after Vietnam's accession to the WTO. Second, we find that POEs profitability decrease after WTO accession, whereas we do not observe any pro-competitive effects of trade for SOEs. Third, productivity increases after trade liberalization in industries with a negligible presence of SOEs, whereas this effect disappears as the presence of SOEs becomes substantial.====The overall productivity gains of this radical trade reform have been lower than expected. We show that WTO access tariff cuts are associated with an annual average increase in manufacturing productivity of 3.7% during the period 2008–2012. Given that the Vietnamese economy featured a robust growth in the pre-WTO period, but far behind the East Asia miracle pace, larger gains were expected from a small, fairly closed, economy like Vietnam joining the WTO.==== Trefler (2004), finds that larger and less closed economies like Canada and the US obtained similar gains from their bilateral trade agreement.==== We show that the presence of SOEs can partially account for the missing productivity gains. We do this by simulating a counterfactual scenario in which we measure the productivity gains that would have been brought about by WTO accession had SOEs not been a strong presence in the economy. This exercise suggests that in the period between 2008 and 2012 the overall productivity gains would have been 40% larger in a counterfactual economy where POEs replace SOEs. In sum, our results indicate that SOEs represent a substantial obstacle to trade-induced efficiency gains.====We look for possible economic mechanisms behind these results through the lenses of a trade model with firm heterogeneity in productivity and ownership. We devise a small open economy version of the Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) model with POEs and SOEs similar in all features except that the latter may operate in sectors subject to higher ==== to entry and have cheaper and more flexible ====. Higher barriers to entry allow SOEs to operate in less competitive markets where they are protected from domestic and foreign competition. Politically regulated entry hampers the pro-competitive effect of trade on firm profitability and firm selection. Things work differently for private firms that face pecuniary barriers to entry due to credit constrains in financing their initial investment. We show that stronger credit constraints generate less entry and less competitive markets, and POEs operating in less competitive industries experience stronger pro-competitive and selection effect of trade. Hence, when entry is regulated politically, liberalization does not increase competition and efficiency, while, when barriers to entry are economic, the impact of trade on competition is stronger the larger the barriers. In our model, as in standard models of trade with firm heterogeneity, selection is a source of trade-induced productivity growth. Consequently, by hampering selection, the presence of SOEs represents a drag on the productivity gains from trade liberalization.====Firms often need to borrow to finance their fixed operating costs, periodic expenses unrelated with the volume of production and sales, such as rental cost of land use, office space, equipment, licences, etc. These expenses play a key role for selection and exit (e.g. Hopenhayn, 1992; Melitz, 2003) because they have to be fully paid even when firms scale down production due to increasing competitive pressure. Introducing fixed operating costs and credit constraints on them in the model, we show that the availability of cheaper and more flexible credit conditions allows SOEs to soften the economic constraints represented by these costs, thereby helping them to weather foreign competition better than private firms.====We then go back to the data and search for empirical validation of these insights. First, we find that the selection effect of WTO is stronger for POEs operating in less competitive (more concentrated) industries. Moreover, we find that POEs entry shows a strong positive response to WTO access, while the entry rate of SOEs does not have a statistically significant correlation with the WTO. Then we show that POEs with a larger debt ratio exit more after trade liberalization, while this relationship is not significant for SOEs. We also build a measure of the cost of borrowing, using firms' interest payment over their debt, and show that trade liberalization decreases this cost substantially for SOEs, but not for POEs. This is consistent with the model's suggestion that cheaper and better access to credit weakens the SOEs' response to trade liberalization.====Our paper is related to several strands of the literature. First, several empirical papers have documented the positive effects of trade on industry productivity through tougher selection and market share reallocation.==== Pavcnik (2002), Trefler (2004), Bernard etal. (2006), Amiti and Konings (2007), Topalova and Khandelwal (2011), and Brandt et al. (2017), among others, analyse the effects of important trade liberalization episodes for Chile, the United States and Canada; the United States alone; Indonesia; India; and China. These works find that a substantial part of the trade-induced increase in productivity is generated by selection and intra-industry reallocations. Our paper contributes to this literature by assessing the productivity gains from trade through inter-firm reallocation in an economy with a non-negligible share of firms owned by the state and with a particular focus on the different response of SOEs and POEs.====There is a stream of new empirical papers assessing the pro-competitive effects of trade with firm-level data. Feenstra and Weinstein (2017) find a substantial reduction in average markups in the US between 1992 and 2005 associated to a large increase in import shares. De Loecker et al. (2016), find that in large trade liberalization episode in India output tariffs reduced markups and that this pro-competitive effect was more than compensated by the positive effect of input tariff cuts on markups. More strictly related to our work, Brandt et al. (2017) show that output tariff cuts related to China's access into the WTO have negative effects on markups and positive effects on TFP, in line with our findings. They also find that input tariff cuts raise both markups and productivity. Although China, as much as Vietnam, has a strong presence of SOEs, the objective of the paper is not to understand the different response of SOEs and POEs to trade. They rather focus on analyzing the different effects of input and output tariffs and on the different response of incumbent firms and entrants.====While SOEs have been largely overlooked by previous studies, there is an emerging literature analyzing different features of ‘state capitalism’. Not surprisingly, much of this literature focuses on China. Song et al. (2011) present a theory of economic transition in China based on reallocation of manufacturing from less productive SOEs to highly productive “entrepreneurial” firms. Credit constraints and other cost wedges prevent entry of more productive private firms and shelter sluggish SOEs from competition. Economic reforms reduce the cost wedges between the two types of firms and trigger a reallocation of resources toward the most efficient firms, thereby setting the economy on a path of privatisation and fast growth. Hsieh and Klenow (2009) find that about two-thirds of aggregate TFP growth in China between 1998 and 2005 - a period that includes China's access to the WTO in 2001 - can be attributed to reallocation from low- to high-productivity plants. Hsie and Song (2015) compare this view of China's growth, the triumph of “Markets over Mao,” with the conflicting view that ‘state capitalism’ through large and successful SOEs has driven growth and development in China. They provide empirical evidence that the drastic reforms of Chinese SOEs that started in the late 1990s led to the privatisation or closure of small and inefficient firms, while large firms were corporatised and kept under state control. They find that the labor productivity of these large SOEs has converged to that of private firms, and SOEs were responsible for about a fifth of aggregate TFP growth during the period 1998–2007. In line with this research, we analyse the productivity effects of reallocations from low- to high-productivity firms, but we differ by focusing on the specific role of trade liberalization as a source of productivity growth in an economy with a large presence of SOEs.====Third, preferential trade agreements have recently begun to involve discussions about ====. These include domestic regulations on the environment, health, safety and labor standards, and domestic taxation, which often generate non-tariff barriers behind national borders. As discussed in Ederington and Ruta (2016), the WTO is taking its first steps in the direction of eliciting cooperation on this type of barriers, especially regarding product and process standards. The empirical and theoretical literature are also trying to understand the nature of these barriers and the mechanisms through which they affect the costs and benefits of international trade agreements. Recent research has shown that commitment issues (Brou and Ruta, 2013), bilateral bargaining over prices (Antras and Staiger, 2012) and coordination externalities (Costinot, 2008) can motivate the need for “deep integration,” going beyond tariff reductions to include coordination of domestic policies.==== Our paper suggests that political/regulatory entry barriers and preferential access to credit can function as de facto behind-the-border barriers and hamper gains from “shallow” integration limited to tariff reduction. Our findings highlight the presence of an important complementarity between trade liberalization and domestic product market reforms. In line with our results, but using cross-country data from 126 countries Freund and Bolaky (2008) show that trade is associated with higher standards of living in economies with less regulated firm entry. They find that a 1% increase in the trade share of GDP is associated with more than a one-half percent rise in per-capita income in economies with low barriers to firm entry, but has no effects in more rigid economies.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we offer an overview of the characteristics of Vietnamese firms and document the reduction in trade barriers produced by WTO accession. In the third section, we discuss our empirical strategy, present the empirical results, and implement some robustness checks to further validate our findings. In the fourth section, we present a model that provides an interpretation of our main empirical findings, suggesting some specific economic mechanisms. A fifth section provides an empirical validation of the mechanisms highlighted by the model.

In this paper we will consider the role of dispersed information in explaining the puzzle. Specifically, we will bring a model of dispersed information proposed by Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006) to the data to see how well it can account for the observed disconnect in the data. A novelty of the paper is to use private information in the form of opinions about the future direction of the Euro-Dollar exchange rate expressed through Twitter from over four years of daily tweets. This is a natural choice as Twitter has become a widely used platform to express opinions and the importance of private information for the determination of exchange rates is well established through the FX microstructure literature.====Meese and Rogoff, 1983a, Meese and Rogoff, 1983b first documented the disconnect between exchange rates and fundamentals by showing that standard fundamentals do not outperform the random walk in accounting for exchange rate fluctuations. The literature since then has largely upheld this finding. Specifically, the literature considers the ratio of mean squared errors (or root mean squared errors) generated by a model versus the random walk. The errors represent the changes in the exchange rate that are not accounted for by contemporaneous changes in the fundamentals. This is compared to errors generated by random walk expectations, where any exchange rate change is an error as the expected change of the exchange rate is zero. The findings show that generally the mean squared error is as large or larger for the model as it is for the random walk. This inability of models to outperform the random walk is known as the Meese Rogoff puzzle and is the result of the very limited explanatory power of observed fundamentals (disconnect).==== The literature has documented the inability of contemporaneous changes in fundamentals to account for exchange rate changes both over short horizons (a month or quarter) and over longer horizons (up to 5 years).====The Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006) model accounts for the disconnect between exchange rates and observed fundamentals in two ways. First, private information affects expectations of excess returns that determine portfolio positions and thus affect exchange rates. This private information cannot be observed by the econometrician. There is a second effect of private information that is a little more subtle. The model exhibits agent-specific portfolio shifts for reasons that are not observed, such as noise trade, liquidity trade, hedging trade, and so on. In the absence of private information these portfolio shifts generally do not have a big effect on asset prices. They affect asset prices through changes in risk-premia, which are essentially third-order. But Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006) show that these portfolio shocks are significantly amplified in the presence of private information due to rational confusion about whether observed exchange rate changes are due to unobserved private information about the future state of the economy or unobserved portfolio shocks. They show that the amplification can be very large. However, Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006) do not confront their model to the data. Their insights are purely theoretical and qualitative. In this paper we will make an attempt to bring data to bear by using opinions expressed through Twitter.====We take several steps to connect verbal tweets about the Euro-Dollar exchange rate to the model of Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006). We first classify tweets as positive, negative or neutral about the direction of the exchange rate. There is an existing literature related to the stock market, reviewed below, which uses classification methods that are not specific to financial markets and the language used by traders in financial markets. We instead develop a “dictionary” of word combinations based on financial lexicon used by traders in the Euro-Dollar market to automate the interpretation of verbal tweets as positive, negative or neutral.==== This leads to a measure of Twitter Sentiment, which is a daily measure based on all tweets during a day. To connect this to the model, we compute expectations of exchange rate changes by the agents in the model and use cutoffs for expectations to discretize them into directional beliefs: +1 (expected Euro appreciation), −1 (expected Euro depreciation) or 0 (neutral) for each agent.====We finally estimate the parameters of the model with the Simulated Method of Moments, using various moments involving exchange rates and Twitter Sentiment. These include the daily variance of Twitter sentiment, the disagreement across agents, directional moments that relate Twitter Sentiment to the direction of future exchange rate changes, predictive correlations that relate Twitter Sentiment to actual future exchange rate changes, the contemporaneous relationship between Twitter Sentiment and exchange rate changes as well as basic exchange rate moments (standard deviation and autocorrelation).====We find that the model cannot be rejected by the data and that the Twitter Sentiment data contains important information about the joint distribution of the key parameters of the information structure. These include the precision of private signals and the volatility and persistence of the noise (exogenous portfolio shocks) that affects exchange rates. It is important to note that there is nothing about the structure of the model that assures the outcome in terms of accounting for exchange rate disconnect. If the private signals in the model are weak (have a sufficiently large signal error variance), we show that the model implies that exchange rate changes are almost exclusively determined by observed fundamentals. The model is then unable to account for the Meese-Rogoff puzzle. We should also emphasize that we do not use mean squared error ratios to estimate the model. In fact, we do not use any data on macro fundamentals to estimate the model. We consider the fundamental in the model to be a summary of macro fundamentals rather than a specific variable such as relative money.====After we estimate the model with Twitter Sentiment and exchange rate data, we simulate it in order to produce mean squared error ratios in a way that is consistent with what has been done in the empirical literature. Specifically, we try to follow as close as possible the methodologies of three papers to produce these mean squared error ratios. The papers are Rossi (2013), Cheung et al. (2005) and Cerra and Saxena (2010). We choose them as they use respectively monthly, quarterly and annual data. After we estimate the model, we can simulate it over as many years as needed (matching the respective papers). While the model is estimated with daily data, we aggregate to the frequencies that have been considered in the literature. We consider both the short-horizon relationships between exchange rates and fundamentals, which correspond to the frequencies of these papers (monthly, quarterly, annual) and 4 or 5 year long-horizon relationships between changes in the exchange rate and fundamentals. We find that the model does a very good job in accounting for the mean squared error ratios reported in the empirical literature.====This is not the first paper that aims to extract information from social media opinions to learn about asset prices. There is a literature that has used messages from social media and the internet to predict stock prices. This usually involves short data samples of no more than a year. Results are based on regressions of stock price returns on either “mood” states (like hope, happy, fear, worry, nervous, upset, anxious, positive, negative) or an opinion about the direction of stock price changes (along the line of positive, negative or neutral). Predictability is considered at most a couple of days into the future. Papers focusing on mood states, like Bollen et al. (2011), Zhang et al. (2011), Mittal and Goel (2012) and Zhang (2013), use an entire sweep of all Twitter messages, or random sets of messages, rather than messages specifically related to financial markets.==== Some of the literature prior to Twitter did focus specifically on financial messages. These include Antweiler and Frank (2004) and Das and Chen (2007), who use message boards like Yahoo!Finance, and Dewally (2003), who uses messages from newsgroups about US stocks.====This literature is purely empirical though and does not attempt to link up to models of dispersed information. In addition, this literature has not employed financial jargon used by traders to classify messages. Most of the literature uses supervised machine-based learning classifiers that are not specific to financial markets at all, such as the Naive Bayes algorithm. We will show that applying such methods to our Twitter data leads to a misleading interpretation of the messages that is of little use. Tetlock (2007) has used a dictionary approach to consider the ability of verbal text to predict stock prices. But it is based on the Harvard IV dictionary that is not specifically related to financial news.==== We should also emphasize that in contrast to this literature, we do not use the Twitter data to forecast future exchange rates. The sample is too short to do this. But we will show, even without applying a model, that Twitter Sentiment predicts the direction of exchange rate changes in a way that is statistically significant.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the Twitter data and methodology used to translate opinionated tweets about the Euro-Dollar exchange rate into positive (+1), negative (−1) and neutral (0) categories. We also show that Twitter Sentiment contains information about the future direction of exchange rate changes and discuss a variety of moments based on Twitter Sentiment that will be used to estimate the model. In Section 3 we describe the Bachetta and van Wincoop (2006) model of exchange rate determination. Section 4 discusses how to connect the model to the data and presents results from estimating the model with the Simulated Method of Moments. Section 5 applies the estimation results to compute Meese-Rogoff type mean squared error ratios and compares the results to findings from the empirical literature.

As a case in point, the two decades preceding the Great Recession—and the associated trade collapse—have seen a rapid expansion in trade participation for many developed countries, coupled with substantial improvements in their living standards. Yet, the same period has witnessed an unprecedented diffusion of anti-globalization sentiments, which have rapidly pervaded several industrialized economies, fueling the affirmation of nationalist parties and putting trade integration under fire.==== The magnitude of this phenomenon, its pervasiveness in society, and the fact that it has emerged during a phase of sustained economic expansion, suggest that trade integration may have produced distributional effects that go beyond the standard adjustments in earnings and employment faced by specific groups of workers after a trade shock. In this paper, we shed light on this issue by documenting the widespread effects of import competition on workers' mental distress.====A rapidly developing literature highlights a number of novel non-pecuniary effects of import competition, including increases in local area crime (Che and Xu, 2016; Dix-Carneiro et al., 2018; Deiana, 2018), household debt (Barrot et al., 2017), and job-related injuries (McManus and Schaur, 2016), as well as reductions in the provision of local public goods (Feler and Senses, 2017), and in marriage and fertility (Autor et al., 2019; Keller and Utar, 2018). A few independent studies, contemporaneous to our work, focus on import competition at the county level in the US and report that more trade exposed localities also experience a relative worsening in the average health conditions of their resident population.==== Interestingly, among the various health indicators analyzed in these studies, trade exposed localities also exhibit higher mortality rates due to suicides and drug overdoses (Adda and Fawaz, 2017; Pierce and Schott, 2019); more hospital admissions due to alcohol abuse (Adda and Fawaz, 2017); and a higher average number of days of poor mental health in the population, as computed from answers to cross-sectional telephone surveys about self-assessed health (Adda and Fawaz, 2017; Lang et al., 2019). An interpretation of this evidence is that the exposure to rising import competition could lead to a deterioration in the mental health of individual workers over time. So far, however, there is no systematic evidence on this effect, as the emerging literature on import competition and health is based either on aggregate data at the local level or on cross-sectional surveys.====In this paper, we draw on extremely detailed, longitudinal, data on UK residents (sourced from the British Household Panel Survey, henceforth BHPS) to provide the first comprehensive analysis of how import competition affects the mental health of individual workers over time. We make four main contributions. First, the possibility to observe a clinically valid measure of mental distress for each person over many years enables us to identify the individual-level responses of mental distress to trade exposure, and to provide a precise quantification of the economic magnitude of the effects. Second, the rich information on demographic, occupational, and job characteristics contained in our data allows us to explore the implications of import competition for different groups of workers, providing the first assessment of how trade exposure shapes the entire distribution of subjective wellbeing across exposed workers. Third, the possibility to link each individual to the other members of her family allows us to study how the effects of import competition propagate to a worker's spouse and children, providing the first evidence of intra-household spillovers. Finally, we are able to shed light on a number of individual-level channels through which import competition may work. Some of these channels may involve a broad population of workers, including those whose observable labor market conditions do not change after the trade shock.====Our main measure of mental distress is the Generalized Health Questionnaire indicator (GHQ-12), an index that is widely used by clinicians for detecting psychiatric illness and extensively employed in academic research on mental health.==== Using the information on each worker's industry of employment contained in the BHPS, we match the individual-level data on GHQ-12 with import data for 119 industries covering the entire UK economy. The period of analysis starts in 1995 and ends in 2007, the year before the onset of the Great Recession.====Over the period of analysis, the UK has experienced a marked increase both in the incidence of mental distress and in import competition. The number of people suffering from mental health problems has reached 8 million in 2007, and the number of individuals using public mental health services has risen by 20% between 2003 and 2007.==== At the same time, trade integration has proceeded rapidly, entailing a sharp increase in imports. Between 1995 and 2007, a period of rapid economic expansion characterized by a 34% growth in real per-capita GDP and a drop in unemployment from 8.7 to 5.3%, the share of total imports in UK GDP has risen by 10% (from 24.8 to 27.3%), while the share of exports has stagnated at around 25% (World Development Indicators). Fig. 1 suggests that import competition and the rise of mental distress over this period could be related to each other. The figure reports raw data on GHQ-12 and imports (normalized by turnover) for all available years, showing that both variables have trended upward in the long run, and have followed a close evolution also from year to year.====The empirical strategy we use for identifying the effect of trade exposure on mental distress consists of comparing GHQ-12 scores across workers who have similar individual characteristics and are employed in industries that have similar attributes but are hit by import shocks of different size. We condition the estimation on individual fixed effects, which remove time-invariant determinants of mental distress at the individual level (e.g., differences in risk factors) and imply that we exploit within-person variation over time for identification. We also control for full sets of sector×year, occupation×year, and local labor market×year fixed effects, which flexibly absorb any other time-varying determinant of mental distress operating at the sector, occupation, and local level. To account for possible remaining correlation between import competition and other domestic shocks to individual UK industries within sectors, we use an instrumental variable (IV) approach. In a similar spirit to Hummels et al. (2014) and Bombardini et al. (2018), we construct an instrument that combines changes in the world export supply of foreign countries with pre-existing differences in the geographical composition of UK imports across industries. This IV strategy is meant to isolate the variation in UK imports due to changes in supply conditions in foreign countries. To avoid selection problems due to the potential sorting of workers across industries in anticipation of future trade shocks, we construct the instrument based on each worker's pre-sample industry of employment.====We find that import competition strongly worsens individual mental distress. Our estimates imply that a one standard deviation larger import shock (approximately equal to the difference between the industries at the 75th and 25th percentiles of the trade exposure distribution) raises GHQ-12 by 1.15 percentage points. This corresponds to about 12% of the within-individual standard deviation of mental distress. This effect is comparable to that of a commensurate increase in crime rates across UK local areas, as estimated by Dustmann and Fasani (2016).==== To further quantify the effect, we compute the monetary compensation that a worker employed in the industry at the 75th percentile of the distribution by trade exposure would need to make up for her greater utility loss compared to a worker employed in the industry at the 25th percentile of the distribution. Mapping GHQ-12 scores into a health-based quality-of-life index, we find that this compensation would amount to £270 per person in a year.==== A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation, which abstracts from any aggregate cost/benefit of import competition, suggests that the average import shock would entail a total annual compensation of roughly £5.2 billion across all workers, i.e., about 0.35% of GDP, or 4.3% of total healthcare expenditure, in the UK in 2007.====We provide an extensive discussion of the baseline results. First, we show that the estimates are unlikely to be driven by correlated demand shocks between the UK and foreign countries, or by underlying trends related to pre-existing differences in GHQ-12 across industries. We also perform a falsification test showing that future import competition does not explain past levels of mental distress. This further supports the view that our results reflect industry-level shocks due to rising trade exposure, rather than trends or time-varying confounds. Second, we use alternative sources of variation in UK imports for identification. In particular, we restrict attention to groups of countries that are more likely to have experienced significant supply shocks over the sample period (i.e., Eastern Europe, India, and China), or use exchange rates as an instrument for UK imports. By and large, we find that import competition worsens mental distress also in these exercises. Third, we show that the baseline evidence still obtains when fitting various alternative specifications. Finally, we find that import competition affects other proxies for mental distress, such as: the probability of reporting health problems related to anxiety and depression, or to the use of alcohol and drugs; the likelihood of becoming a heavy smoker and the number of cigarettes smoked; and the probability that GHQ-12 exceeds critical thresholds such as the one associated with suicidal ideation.====We compare the effects of import competition with those of other shocks related to globalization and technological progress. We find that, contrary to import competition, export shocks have either no or a mildly positive effect on individuals' mental health in our data. This evidence is broadly consistent with rising import competition being a most prominent aspect of trade integration for the UK over the sample period, as discussed above. Similarly, we find that technology shocks related to computerization and automation have no statistically significant impact on workers' mental distress. The latter result could also suggest that the implications of import competition for mental distress may be different from those of other facets of structural change.====Having studied how the mental distress of the average worker in an industry responds to import competition, we turn to investigating how these effects vary across workers within industries. Using alternative approaches, including recent techniques for the IV estimation of quantile regression models with fixed effects (Powell, 2016), we find the impact of trade exposure to grow monotonically, and sharply, in size along the distribution of GHQ-12. To further characterize the heterogeneity in the effects of import competition across workers within industries, we use information on demographic, occupational, and job characteristics. We find that the effects of trade exposure are systematically stronger for workers who are young, have a large family or a poor financial situation, are employed in blue-collar or tradable jobs, have a short tenure with the current employer, or are on a temporary contract. Overall, these novel results imply that trade exposure worsens inequality in subjective wellbeing not only by inducing a relative increase in mental distress for the average workers in more exposed industries, but also by widening the distribution of mental distress across workers within industries.====Next, we take advantage of information on family ties, a distinguishing feature of the BHPS, to study whether and how the effects of import competition spill over to other members of the family. We find that women's mental distress increases as a consequence of the import competition faced by their partners. We provide evidence that these spillovers are consistent with women being less satisfied with household income and the quality of marital relations as a consequence of their partners' import shocks.==== Moreover, we find different pieces of evidence speaking to the existence of intergenerational spillovers from parents to children. In particular, the import competition faced by the father tends to have detrimental effects on parental investment in children, as well as on their self-esteem and life satisfaction. All these outcomes are known to have negative repercussions on the future health and labor market outcomes of the youths (e.g., Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Currie, 2009).====Finally, we analyze a number of individual-level mechanisms that could underlie the effects of trade exposure on mental distress. We start by considering job displacement, given that unemployment and job losses are known to be associated with a significant worsening of mental health.==== Consistent with this evidence, we find a strong positive correlation between job displacement and mental distress in our data. At the same time, we find that import competition substantially raises the likelihood for a worker to switch out of employment.==== These findings suggest that trade exposure indeed increases mental distress through job displacement. Interestingly, however, we find that the effects of import competition are not limited to displaced workers, but also extend to continuously employed individuals. In particular, our evidence suggests that continuing workers are negatively affected by import competition as this: (i) lowers wage growth, (ii) reduces job satisfaction (in particular, regarding important working conditions such as job security and workload), and (iii) worsens expectations about future economic prospects. These are three changes of workers' profiles that we find to be strongly associated with higher mental distress in our data.====Besides the work cited above, our paper connects with an emerging parallel literature studying how other aspects of globalization affect individual wellbeing. Hummels et al. (2016) study the role of exports. Using matched employer-employee data for Denmark, the authors find that export shocks, by expanding the scale of firms' operations, increase the risk of injuries and illness among Danish workers, as well as their use of antidepressants and different types of medical services including visits to psychiatrists. Conversely, using individual-level panel data for China, Crozet et al. (2018) find that export growth has contributed to increasing individuals' life satisfaction. Our evidence on export shocks is broadly consistent with these mixed results, which are likely to reflect the fact that, unlike import competition, export shocks may raise not only job-related stress but also income. Focusing on immigration, Giuntella and Mazzonna (2015) and Giuntella et al. (2016) find that this improves the health of natives by inducing them to switch to less risky jobs. Looking at industrializing countries, Bombardini and Li (2016) find that the recent Chinese export growth has raised infant mortality across Chinese prefectures by increasing the level of pollution. Finally, Giuntella et al. (2018) find that imports of unhealthy food from the US have raised the prevalence of obesity across Mexican states. Our work complements these studies by highlighting a different, and not yet fully understood, mechanism through which globalization may affect individual wellbeing.====Our paper also connects with the broader empirical literature on the implications of import competition for the labor markets of developed countries (e.g, Autor et al., 2013, Autor et al., 2014, Autor et al., 2015; Dauth et al., 2014, Dauth et al., 2018; Felbermayr et al., 2011, Pierce and Schott, 2016; Utar, 2014, Utar, 2018; see Autor et al., 2016a, and Dorn, 2018, for updated reviews). These papers show that workers employed in import competing industries, or regions, bear significant adjustment costs to import competition, in terms of higher probability of job displacement and lower wages. Our findings suggest that trade exposure implies additional, non-pecuniary, adjustment costs for these workers, in the form of increased mental distress. These costs may also extend to workers who do not witness significant changes in their labor market outcomes, through a reduction in job satisfaction and worsened expectations about the future. Clearly, because our results are identified through differences in import pressure across industries, they capture the relative effect of trade exposure. Similar to this literature, therefore, our findings do not speak to the overall welfare effects of globalization but to its distributional consequences.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Finally, in those prefectures, working hours of “native” unskilled workers significantly increased, and internal migrants found employment in the places they migrated to.","China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 is one of the major economic changes of the new century. Much has been written about the impact of this event on the economies of China's trading partners, for example the United States.==== In particular, the literature provides evidence on how U.S. workers have been affected by greater Chinese competition, for example through changes in employment rates.====In this paper we analyze the effect on workers in China.==== Our main contribution is to show empirically that one important channel of impact on these workers has been internal migration. Our paper is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of internal migration for all Chinese prefectures using individual-level Census data (to measure migration flows) and firm-level export data (to account for the local exposure to the international trade shock) together with an identification strategy based on plausibly exogenous variation. We investigate the implications of a specific consequence of WTO membership – namely the reduction in trade policy uncertainty faced by Chinese exporters to the U.S. – on internal migration in China. We study whether we can identify a link between reduction in trade policy uncertainty, changes in trade patterns and local labor demand, and the induced relocation of workers across Chinese prefectures.====Understanding China's “Great Migration” (Scheineson, 2009) is important both because of the sheer size of the phenomenon, and because of the impact it has had on China's economy and society. As of 2014, China's National Bureau of Statistics estimated that 278 million individuals – or 20% of the country's total population – lived outside their home towns for at least 6 months each year. To gain perspective, if Chinese internal migrants were a separate country, they would make up the fourth largest one in the world.====Several papers have highlighted the key role played by the geographic relocation of “surplus labor” (Lewis, 1954) in explaining productivity – and more generally – economic growth in China (Tombe and Zhu, 2015; Bond et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015). Other contributions have emphasized instead the social challenges brought about by migration: unskilled migrant workers do not enjoy even basic labor rights, lack welfare coverage and are systematically exposed to discrimination in the urban areas where they move (Scheineson, 2009). Less instead is known on the link between changes in the trade policy environment, and in particular trade policy uncertainty, and the relocation of workers across different regions within China. The goal of this paper is to shed light on this important question.====To carry out our analysis, we combine data from several sources. We construct internal migration rates using individual-level information from, respectively, China's 2000 population Census and 2005 “mini” Census. Taking advantage of the detailed information in the data, we focus on individuals who have moved from their usual residence and identify those who have acquired the ==== (registration) in the locality where they currently reside, and those who instead have not.==== We follow the literature and define the former as “==== migrants” and the latter as “non-==== migrants”. We measure trade policy uncertainty – faced by Chinese exporters to the U.S. – using the product-specific normal-trade-relations (NTR) gap measure developed by Handley and Limao (2017) and Pierce and Schott (2016). This measure is built by calculating the gap between the Most Favorite Nation (MFN) tariffs applied by the United States to WTO members and the threat tariffs that would have been implemented if MFN status was not renewed to China by the U.S. Congress (the so called column 2 tariffs of the Smoot-Hawley Trade Act). To determine ==== exposure to uncertainty, at the level of a Chinese prefecture, we follow Bartik (1991). Specifically, we draw on export data at the firm level between 1997 and 1999 – i.e. before our period of investigation – which we use to construct a weighted average of the NTR gap across products for each Chinese prefecture. Additionally, we assess the robustness of our results using weights which are based on the employment distribution in 1990.====Our analysis delivers several interesting findings. First, we show that Chinese prefectures facing a larger decline in trade policy uncertainty experienced larger inflows of migrant workers. When we look at different types of migrants – ==== vs. non-==== migrants – we find that it is the latter who drive the changes in internal migration rates. This implies that the labor flows triggered by the reduction in trade policy uncertainty were characterized by a limited access of migrants to local public goods and services. Second, we investigate the role played by one natural mechanism that could explain our main finding, namely changes in trade flows. Taking advantage of firm-level data, we show that products and prefectures facing a larger decline in trade policy uncertainty experienced a larger increase in exports towards the United States.====Next, we exploit the richness of the individual-level Census data to explore heterogeneous effects across several dimensions. In particular, we separately estimate the impact of trade policy uncertainty reduction on skilled and unskilled migrants, migrants of different age groups, gender and ==== status at origin (rural vs. urban). This type of analysis enables us to examine the extent to which the trade policy shock affected different subgroups of the population. Our results indicate that the trade shock had a larger impact on male compared to female migrants; on migrants in prime working age, on the skilled and on those with urban ==== at origin. At the same time we find that the main adjustment in the case of unskilled labor has involved an increase in the number of hours worked by local (“native”) unskilled workers. Finally, our data show that employment ==== of migrants increased following the reduction in trade policy uncertainty.====To summarize, the greater the reduction in trade policy uncertainty in a prefecture, the higher the increase in migration rate to that prefecture – of non-==== migrants and of skilled migrants – and the higher the increase in the number of hours worked by unskilled native workers. Hence our analysis indicates that the adjustment has taken place through changes in migration, for skilled labor, and through changes in the number of hours worked for unskilled labor. In general, the main contribution of our paper is to provide new results on the labor-market adjustment of local economies to trade policy changes, in particular highlighting the importance of internal migration. Our results suggest that one way China has been able to reap the benefits of trade openness has been through a more efficient geographic allocation of (skilled) workers. Hence this is yet another example of how migration facilitates economic development and growth.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains how our paper fits into the existing literature. In Section 3 we provide additional context for our analysis, focusing on internal labor mobility in China and the change in the trade policy environment after 2001.

Using French data, we show that this homotheticity property is soundly rejected: larger firms concentrate their import spending on their top varieties, holding the sourcing strategy fixed. To rationalize this finding, we propose a novel model of importing that features (i) a complementarity between firm productivity and input quality and (ii) heterogeneity across countries in their ability to produce high quality inputs. This model implies that large firms bias their spending towards countries with a comparative advantage in producing high quality inputs and hence generates a non-homothetic import demand system. We provide empirical support for this and other predictions of this theory.","Understanding the behavior of individual firms has been at the center of the recent research agenda in international trade. Most of this research has focused on the role of firms as exporters. Recently, there has been a new emphasis on the behavior of firms as importers of intermediate inputs, which account for two-thirds of world trade (Johnson and Noguera (2017), Miroudot et al. (2009)). This literature has for example focused on the link between imported inputs and firm productivity (Halpern et al. (2015), Blaum et al. (2018)), the effect of large crises on aggregate productivity (Gopinath and Neiman (2014), Blaum (2019)), domestic product scope (Goldberg et al. (2010)), and firms' global sourcing patterns (Antràs et al. (2017)).====While different in focus, the contributions in the literature have mostly relied on a common theoretical framework. Because productivity is assumed to be factor neutral, this common framework features a strong restriction on firms' import demand system: holding the set of sourcing countries fixed, firm productivity should not affect the allocation of spending. In other words, essentially all existing firm-based models of input trade imply that firms' import demand is homothetic.====In this paper, we use French micro data to test this homotheticity prediction and show that it is systematically rejected. We find that firms differ substantially in how they allocate their spending across a common set of sourcing countries and that these differences are systematically related to firm size. In particular, large firms concentrate their expenditure on their most important trading partners. To rationalize this finding, we extend the baseline framework in the literature by incorporating (i) a complementarity between input quality and firm productivity and (ii) heterogeneity across countries in their ability to produce high quality inputs. This extended model predicts that import demand is non-homothetic because large firms import expensive, high quality inputs and therefore bias their spending patterns towards countries with a comparative advantage in the production of inputs of higher quality. We rely on data on unit values to verify this and other predictions of the extended model.====We start our analysis by laying out a framework that nests most of the contributions in the literature on input trade, which we refer to as the baseline model of importing. Firms can source their inputs from multiple foreign countries, there is imperfect substitutability, and the production technology features constant returns to scale given the set of inputs sourced. Importantly, as long as firm productivity is factor neutral, this baseline framework features a homothetic import demand system. In particular, holding the set of sourcing countries fixed, firms' expenditure shares depend only on the prices and qualities of the sourcing countries and should therefore be independent of firm size.====We next implement a test for this prediction in the data. As stressed by the theory, this requires appropriately controlling for the extensive margin of trade. We do so by comparing firms sourcing a particular product from the exact same set of countries.==== We find systematic violations of the baseline model as firms disagree substantially in their allocation of import expenditure across countries. Importantly, such disagreement is not merely idiosyncratic but is systematically related to firm size. In particular, we show that the expenditure distribution of large firms first-order stochastically dominates that of smaller firms. In addition, the allocation of domestic vs foreign expenditure is also non-homothetic. Large firms spend relatively more on domestic inputs, after controlling for the extensive margin.====Our findings are at odds with a large class of models. The reason is that the homotheticity of import demand in the baseline model is independent of many aspects of the theory. Most importantly, we do not have to impose any restriction on firms' extensive margin of importing. Hence, our test applies regardless of whether importing is subject to fixed costs, to what extent such fixed costs vary across firms and countries, or whether firms select their trading partners through a dynamic process of network formation. Moreover, we also allow firms to compete in output markets in an unrestricted way and we do not need to impose particular functional forms for firms' production technologies.====We then propose a tractable extension of the baseline model of importing that endogenously generates a non-homothetic import demand and can rationalize our findings. We do so by incorporating two additional ingredients. First, every sourcing country offers a menu of inputs which are differentiated by quality. Higher quality inputs are more costly to produce and, crucially, countries differ in the elasticity of production costs with respect to quality. This country-specific elasticity controls the degree of comparative advantage in the production of high quality inputs. Second, we depart from firm productivity being factor neutral and allow for a complementarity between firm productivity and input quality as in Kugler and Verhoogen (2012).====We derive two results in the extended model. First, more productive firms buy higher quality inputs within any given country. This follows from the complementarity between input quality and firm productivity. Second, large firms particularly benefit from countries that produce quality more efficiently, hence generating an import demand system that is non-homothetic at the country level. This non-homotheticity arises from the interaction between the quality-productivity complementarity at the firm-level and the heterogeneity in quality production costs across countries. Importantly, without differences in comparative advantage across countries, the within-country sorting pattern of firm productivity and input quality would end up being irrelevant for the allocation of expenditure across countries, generating an import demand system that is homothetic at the country level as in the baseline model.====We then provide empirical support for the extended model using firm-level data on input prices. We proceed in three steps. First, we document that larger firms pay higher prices for their inputs within origin countries. Second, we use this within-country relationship between input prices and firm size to estimate the elasticity of production costs with respect to quality at the country level. Intuitively, because the theory implies that large firms buy higher quality inputs, we can infer unobserved input quality from the size of its buyer. Thus, we can recover the price-quality elasticity by comparing the prices paid by firms of different size within sourcing countries. Importantly, we find substantial cross-country heterogeneity in the estimated elasticities and hence in comparative advantage in quality production.====Finally, in a third step, we test for the main prediction of the extended model that large firms bias their spending towards countries that efficiently produce high quality inputs. Using the price-quality elasticities estimated in the previous step, we find empirical support for this prediction. In addition, we show that countries whose price-quality elasticity was estimated to be low tend to account for large shares of firms' import spending. Taken together, these results show that the model of input quality choice generates a non-homothetic import demand system that is in line with the data.====This paper is most closely related to the recent literature on firm-based models of importing. This literature takes a structural approach to study firms' importing decisions and explores a variety of questions. Examples include the relationship between firms' import activities and firm and aggregate productivity (see. e.g. Halpern et al. (2015), Blaum et al. (2018), Goldberg et al. (2010), Ramanarayanan (2014), Gopinath and Neiman (2014), Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008)), the analysis of firms' sourcing decisions (Antràs et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2016; Boehm et al., 2018), or the exchange-rate disconnect (Amiti et al. (2014)). Despite their different focus, all of these papers employ frameworks where the resulting import demand system is homothetic at the intensive margin.==== We present systematic evidence against this implication and therefore reject a property which is shared by many contributions in the literature.====To explain the observed non-homotheticity of firms' import demand, we build a model of importing where firms can choose the quality of their inputs within sourcing countries. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a theory of importing with such firm-level non-homotheticities. We follow Kugler and Verhoogen (2012) in assuming that input quality and firm productivity are complements. In contrast to them, we focus on the choice of input quality within foreign countries and how this affects the allocation of import spending across countries. Consistent with our theory, we find that larger firms pay higher prices for their imported inputs within narrowly defined products. This is in line with Kugler and Verhoogen, 2009, Kugler and Verhoogen, 2012, who show that larger firms pay higher average input prices and Manova and Zhang (2012), who show that exporters buy more expensive inputs from abroad. Importantly, we find that countries differ in their ability to produce high quality inputs, with richer countries being particularly productive in producing high quality goods. This finding is reminiscent but different to Khandelwal (2010). He uses data on import prices and aggregate import shares to estimate country-level quality. We use firm-variation to estimate the slope of the quality production function within sourcing countries.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 lays out the baseline model of importing and derives the homotheticity property of import demand. Section 3 contains our test of this homotheticity property. In Section 4, we introduce a tractable extension of the baseline model and show that it can rationalize our findings.

To identify the trade channel empirically, I make use of heterogeneity in the direction of trade flows across ==== in the same state: Industries that depended relatively more on final demand from states with housing boom-bust cycles grew by more before the crisis and declined faster from 2007 to 09. A one ==== difference in the exposure to demand shocks during the recession explains a 2.9 percentage point difference in employment growth.","While the initial increase in unemployment during the Great Recession was concentrated in areas with housing busts, subsequently unemployment spread across space. By 2009, it was above pre-crisis levels in almost all U.S. counties. Fig. 1 maps this “geographic spread” of the crisis.==== How did local shocks diffuse through the economy, causing business cycle co-movement across U.S. states?====This paper argues that trade across U.S. states contributed substantially to the spread of the crisis across space. To the extent that producers of tradable goods across the U.S. depend on markets experiencing a housing bust and consumption collapse, they face a shock to their market size. I empirically trace the effect of these demand shocks through the trade and input-output network that connects U.S. states at the industry level. Industries that depended more on markets with larger declines in consumer demand experienced a substantially larger fall in employment. This effect is driven by both direct sales to consumers and indirect effects through input-output relationships.====I exploit differences in trading patterns across industries that are located in the same state to separate the trade channel from other potential contagion mechanisms. Within a state, industries differ in their shocks to market size to the extent that they depend on markets experiencing a consumption collapse. I measure this dependence using data on trade flows from the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) and intermediate goods relationships from BEA IO tables. The resulting measure captures both direct links to consumers in affected states and indirect links through intermediate goods. State-specific consumer demand shocks are captured using data on pre-crisis household leverage, as in Mian and Sufi (2012). The empirical approach relies on the identification assumption that industries that depend ==== more on states experiencing a housing bust are not ==== more affected by other shocks. Thus, other potentially confounding shocks (such as credit supply shocks or expectation shocks) are controlled for to the extent that they do not affect industries differentially in a way that is correlated with the direction of trade flows.====My empirical analysis finds a sizable role for trade in the transmission of the crisis: First, I find that a one standard deviation in the variable measuring exposure to demand shocks causes a 2.9 percentage point difference in 2007–09 employment growth, which corresponds to 18% of the total dispersion in employment growth among tradable producers. This result is robust to focusing only on variation in trade flows that arises from different transportation costs across industries. Moreover, it is specific to trade flows ====, but not trade flows ==== highly leveraged states.====Second, I study the dynamic evolution of the industries over a longer (10 year) horizon. Industries selling particularly to high-leverage states were booming before the crisis, thus benefitting from the housing and consumption boom in these states. This pattern reverses with the beginning of the recession in 2007 and reaches a low in 2009. With the recovery starting in 2009, the differential effect across industries slowly converges back to zero. I thus find evidence that strongly supports the view that trade in goods is important for linking business cycle fluctuations across states.====Two tests of heterogeneous adjustment across industries further support the main results. First, I find that the effect is stronger for industries producing durable goods. This is in line with existing empirical evidence that demand for durable goods fell by more during the recession. Second, the effect is more pronounced in industries producing more differentiated goods. This is consistent with the idea that industries producing more homogeneous output can more easily offset a shock to a particular market by increasing their market share at other destinations.====Next, I split up the trade shock variable into a component capturing direct sales to consumers in affected states, and a component capturing indirect dependence on these states through intermediate goods relationships. I find that both effects contributed to the decline in employment. The estimated coefficients are of similar magnitude, implying that only an industry's total exposure to demand shocks matters, but not its division into direct and indirect linkages.====The main result holds in several further robustness tests. Among others, I control explicitly for credit supply shocks, using data on the geography of bank lending from bank balance sheets and the location of bank branches. While I also find some role for the credit channel in reducing employment, consistent with previous literature (Chodorow-Reich (2014), Greenstone et al. (2014)), the estimates of the trade channel do not change when the credit channel is controlled for.====This project relates to several strands of literature. First, the paper is closely linked to the work by Caliendo et al. (2018), who study the regional propagation of local shocks in a calibrated model of the U.S. economy. Similarly, Eaton et al. (2016) and Monte (2014) have studied the general equilibrium effects of regional shocks in trade models. I view this paper as complementary to this line of work, especially since its focus is an empirical investigation of the regional propagation of shocks.====Second, this paper is closely connected to the literature on trade, volatility, and business cycle comovement. Frankel and Rose (1998) were the first to highlight that countries that trade more with each other tend to have more correlated economic outcomes. Following this work, a long literature has investigated the relationship between trade openness, volatility, and output comovement. On the theory side, Kose and Yi (2006) have shown that in a standard international business cycle model, trade does not lead to the high degree of comovement that is observed in the data (the trade-comovement puzzle).==== On the empirical side, many papers have focused on the association between trade openness and the variance of output growth or the correlation of output growth across countries.====The paper also relates to the literature on consumer demand shocks during the Great Recession. On the theory side, Midrigan and Philippon (2011) and Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) provide models of the recession driven by a collapse in aggregate demand. On the empirical side, Mian et al. (2012), using micro consumption data, document the fall in consumer demand as a result of the housing bust. Mian and Sufi (2014) show that this collapse in consumption was the main driver of employment losses in cities that experienced housing boom and bust cycles. I empirically trace the effect of these local demand shocks on other regions through the within-U.S. trade network.====Finally, this paper is related to the literature on the contagion of crises, such as van Rijckeghem and Weder (2001), Glick and Rose (1999), Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000), and Forbes (2004).==== This line of literature has focused on estimating the channels of contagion ==== countries using data on cross-country financial and trade linkages. More recently, some papers have analyzed international contagion in the context of the Great Recession, such as Aiyar (2012) and Centorelli and Goldberg (2011). In contrast to this literature, I focus entirely on within-country contagion.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

Empirical evidence shows that during recent years inequality has increased in many countries, across the spectrum of development.==== For example, in China the Gini coefficient increased from 0.291 in 1981, to 0.327 in 1990, and 0.474 in 2012. In the United States the Gini coefficient was 0.394 in 1970, 0.428 in 1990, and 0.48 in 2014.==== Concurrently, cross-border holdings of gross financial assets and liabilities have increased enormously, especially during the period from the mid-1990s to 2007. In 1970 the world-wide ratio of the stock of external assets and liabilities to ==== was around 45%. It approximately doubled to 100% by 1987, and then accelerated to around 200% in 1998 and 400% in 2007 (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2017). This development has also been associated with dramatic changes in the net external financial positions of many countries.==== Recent research suggests that the growth in cross-border holdings of capital in terms of world GDP has slowed substantially, but the levels remain very high (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2017). These developments naturally raise the question of the nature of the link (if any) between the process of financial liberalization and the growing income inequality. The objective of this paper is to develop a rigorous model directed at addressing this important issue.====The impact of globalization associated with trade openness on income inequality has received increasing attention. This literature is extensive and in the late 1990s gained enormous impetus, which has continued.==== In contrast, the consequences of the recent dramatic increase in the cross-border holdings of both assets and liabilities for inequality has received only relatively sparse attention.====Of the existing literature, the paper to which this is most closely related is the empirical study by Jaumotte et al. (2013). They find that trade globalization (as measured by the ratio of exports and imports to GDP) is associated with less income inequality, while financial globalization (as measured by the ratio of cross-border assets and liabilities to GDP), and foreign direct investment especially (as measured by the ratio of inward foreign direct investment stock to GDP), in contrast, is associated with more inequality. They also find technological progress to be a significant force driving inequality. These results are obtained using data from 51 countries (20 developed and 31 developing) over 1981–2003, based on an extended version of the World Bank ==== database.==== One drawback of their study is their mixed use of inequality data based on both income and consumption surveys, depending upon availability, which, however, are not directly comparable, given that consumption-based Gini coefficients tend to show lower inequality.====Other related studies include Bergh and Nilsson (2010), who showed that globalization, as measured by freedom to trade internationally (trade taxes, tariff rates and trade barriers, and capital market controls), increases inequality. This study includes 79 countries over the period 1970–2005 and is based on the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) compiled by Solt (2009). Bumann and Lensink (2016) have recently shown that financial liberalization (as measured by financial depth through capital account liberalization) reduces inequality, for five-year panel covering 106 countries over the time period 1973 to 2008. Their study is based on the dataset compiled by Galbraith and Kum (2005), where capital account liberalization is measured as Chinn and Ito (2008), and financial depth is captured by the ratio of private credit over GDP.==== Recent research by Furceri and Loungani (2018) has found that capital account liberalization [as measured by Chinn and Ito, 2008] increases the Gini measure of inequality, based on panel data estimates for 149 countries from 1970 to 2010 under the SWIID.====In contrast to these papers, which are almost entirely empirical, our objective is to analyze the impact of financial liberalization on income inequality within a more formally structured general equilibrium framework. Our analysis comprises three components. The first is the development of the underlying stochastic equilibrium, the main objective of which is to identify the channels through which financial liberalization impinges on income inequality. However, the complexity of the model necessitates its numerical analysis, and the second phase of our analysis is its calibration and a quantitative assessment of the relationship. Finally, we subject the main theoretical and quantitative results of the model to extensive empirical testing.====The basic theoretical framework we employ is an extension to a small open economy of the stochastic growth model developed by García-Peñalosa and Turnovsky (2006a), used to analyze the impact of risk volatility on income distribution in a closed economy. In our view it is important to employ a stochastic framework. This is because the heart of international financial liberalization concerns its impact on agents' portfolio choices as they balance off the risks and returns on investments worldwide, and this issue can really be studied adequately only in a stochastic setting.====A key feature of the model is that the domestic economy has restricted access to international financial markets. It is able to lend and borrow abroad simultaneously, but in either case it is subject to financial frictions that are reflected in costs that increase with its position in the relevant market. By being able to borrow and lend abroad simultaneously, whether the country is a net creditor (positive net international financial assets) or a net debtor (negative net international financial assets) is determined endogenously and an economy's net asset position can switch, as has periodically occurred. In recognition of the diversity of experiences with respect to net financial assets, in our numerical analysis we distinguish between creditor and debtor economies, which indeed are impacted differentially by financial liberalization.====Financial liberalization is manifested as a reduction in the costs associated with trading in international financial markets. Introducing independent frictions (and corresponding financial liberalization) associated with foreign lending and borrowing reflects the reality that the reasons countries impose controls on capital outflows (lending abroad) are essentially independent of those imposed on capital inflows (borrowing abroad). The former are motivated by concerns such as avoiding downward pressure on the exchange rate and keeping domestic savings at home, while the rationale for the latter include avoiding upward pressure on the exchange rate, and protecting domestic capital markets and specific industrial sectors.====The main insight of the theoretical framework is to identify the channels whereby financial liberalization influences income inequality. First, there are the direct portfolio adjustments associated with the liberalization. To the extent that these increase the returns to investing abroad or reduce the costs of borrowing from abroad, since these activities are pursued by the more affluent members of society, they will increase income inequality. But, in addition the two forms of liberalization have sharply contrasting effects on domestic activity, and their consequences also need to be taken into account. Reducing the cost of investing abroad tends to divert resources from the domestic economy, reducing employment, raising the wage, reducing the return to domestic capital, and providing an offsetting ameliorating effect on the increase in income inequality. In contrast, reducing the cost of borrowing stimulates the domestic economy, raising employment, reducing the real wage, increasing the return to capital, and increasing inequality.====Calibrating the model to match the changes in the portfolio shares over the 1970–2015 period of globalization, we find that financial liberalization favoring investment abroad has a bigger impact on income inequality than does reduced borrowing costs, which may have actually reduced inequality. However, our numerical simulations suggest that, taken together, the overall effect of financial liberalization has been to increase income inequality, in both creditor and debtor economies.====In the last part of the paper we conduct a comprehensive empirical test of the model and its implications using the most recent data for a sample of 96 countries over the period 1970–2015 (or 70 countries for the period 1990–2015, due to limited data availability for some control variables). To do so, we first show that our representations of financial liberalization in terms of reduced borrowing and lending costs is always associated with increased international financial integration, expressed as the sum of the portfolio shares of wealth devoted to foreign assets and liabilities. Using this measure as a proxy for financial liberalization, we find that the main theoretical results for the model are broadly supported by the empirical evidence, providing compelling support for a causal relationship between international financial integration and increased income inequality. Evidence for nonlinear effects of financial integration are also supported. Disaggregating our measure of international financial integration into its separate components (assets and liabilities) yields less conclusive results, but are nevertheless suggestive of the idea that financial liberalization directed at foreign lending have different implications than those directed at borrowing.====Finally, we note some measurement issues relevant to the empirical implementation of the model. First, there are different measures of income inequality, the most widely used being the Gini coefficient. Second, there are different Gini coefficients, depending on the specific income measure. Thus, the Gini coefficient can be expressed in net or gross terms, it can be based on income or consumption data, or it can be provided by individuals or households. Third, the Gini coefficient varies substantially depending on the sources of data employed to calculate it. Choosing the right database involves trade-offs, concerning the accuracy and comparability of the data, and the size of the sample. Thus, we find Gini coefficients based on actual household surveys and estimates based on regressions or other methods. The former are typically preferred to the latter, because, being based on actual data, are usually more accurate. However, this also usually means a smaller sample size. The best source for actual data on inequality is probably “All the Ginis” (ATG henceforth) database, compiled by Branko Milanovic (since 2004) to “standardize” Gini coefficients, due to its coverage and comparability from different sources among countries.==== The best source for other types of estimates is probably the SWIID, produced by Solt, 2009, Solt, 2015.==== We choose the ATG database, for being based on actual data. In addition, it allows us to capture conveniently differences in sources through dummies.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 relates our analytical approach to the relevant literature. Section 3 sets out the basic model, while Section 4 derives the measure of income inequality and how it is impacted by financial liberalization. Section 5 describes the numerical simulations of the equilibrium stochastic model. The empirical implementation of the model is described in Sections 6 and 7, while Section 8 concludes.

Instead, for SOAEs the dynamics of bank credit can matter to some degree, but more broadly a global financial risk shock passes through more directly into the economy.","The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008–2009 highlighted the extent to which U.S. financial disruptions can have dramatic effects on aggregate economic activity. The GFC also showed how such disruptions can impact labor markets and propagate to other countries, of which emerging economies (EMEs) and ==== advanced economies (SOAEs) were particularly vulnerable. Recent studies stress the international transmission of U.S. financial risk shocks to these country groups via credit markets and the banking system (Blanchard et al., 2010; Gilchrist et al., 2013). However, little is known about the differential degree of ==== propagation of these foreign shocks and, importantly, their consequences for labor markets in EMEs and SOAEs. This paper addresses these issues by means of an empirical approach.====In this paper, we present evidence based on a panel structural vector autoregression (SVAR) showing that in response to a temporary increase in global financial risk—defined as a rise in U.S. firm credit spreads, which is a common measure of global financial risk—labor market and aggregate economic conditions deteriorate substantially less in EMEs compared to SOAEs. A key variable that we include in our analysis and that makes this point exceedingly clear is unemployment. More specifically, we find that while the ==== responses of GDP, investment, and unemployment to a temporary adverse global financial risk shock are very similar between country groups, the medium-run responses of these domestic variables—most notably unemployment—are ultimately more subdued and exhibit considerably less propagation in EMEs compared to SOAEs.====The first stage of our analysis immediately suggests a relationship between country interest rates and the differential response to global financial risk shocks across country groups. Specifically, despite EME interest rates exhibiting a sharp on-impact increase in response to greater global financial risk, the path of these rates as the increase in global financial risk dissipates follows that of U.S. interest rates by falling persistently and staying below mean in the medium term (the link between EME and U.S. interest rates is in line with Uribe and Yue, 2006). Importantly, the behavior of EME interest rates in the aftermath of the shock is distinctly associated with a more limited contraction of GDP and investment as well as a fairly swift return to trend of these variables. Notably, the medium-term dynamics of EME interest rates are also associated with a limited and more short-lived expansion of unemployment in the medium term. In contrast, in SOAEs, which exhibit a considerably greater economic downturn and a more persistent expansion in unemployment compared to EMEs, interest rates are relatively insensitive to global financial risk on impact, and only slowly rise in the medium term. A deeper analysis suggests that the relative inertia in SOAE interest rates is not, on its own, prominently associated with the greater adverse impact of global financial risk in SOAEs compared to EMEs. This result suggests that even if in response to a global financial risk shock SOAE interest rates behaved exactly like EME rates, SOAEs would still exhibit a greater deterioration of economic activity and a larger and more persistent expansion in unemployment.====We extend our baseline model to explore the role of bank credit as a transmission mechanism. Including this variable can, intuitively, be important since it is well known that compared to EMEs, SOAEs have greater average bank credit-GDP ratios (a reflection of greater financial development) and feature a much greater degree of household and firm participation in the domestic banking system (GFDR, 2014). Results from this extended framework suggest that, after an increase in global financial risk, a greater and more protracted deterioration in SOAE bank credit compared to EMEs is associated with the greater and more persistent deterioration of GDP in SOAEs. This fact can be intuitively understood by noting that more than half of bank credit in SOAEs represents household credit. With private consumption accounting for the bulk of GDP, contractions in bank credit that adversely affect private consumption via household credit can have an important impact on output. However, we find that this larger bank contraction in bank credit is not particularly meaningful for the behavior of investment in SOAEs, which suggests that in SOAEs the pass-through of global financial risk to investment is more direct compared to EMEs, where country interest rates matter more.====Focusing more directly on the behavior of unemployment, a well-known important characteristic that distinguishes EMEs from SOAEs is the fact that, compared to SOAEs, the breadth of firm informality (that is, unregistered firms that rarely participate in the domestic banking system) in EMEs is much larger. In addition, informal firms in EMEs accounts for a large share of total employment. As such, we examine the extent to which these characteristics can be important for the differential peak response of unemployment. This analysis suggests that greater firm informality in EMEs is in fact associated with a smaller ==== in unemployment in EMEs compared to SOAEs after a global financial risk shock. However, in both low-and high-firm informality EMEs, the medium-term dynamics of EME interest rates are much more strongly associated with a more subdued and less persistent expansion of unemployment compared to SOAEs.====In sum, our analysis suggests that after a global financial risk shock, compared to SOAEs, in EMEs the lesser ==== domestic impact on GDP, investment, ==== unemployment, as well as the lower persistence of unemployment, is associated with a long-lived ==== decline in country interest rates (that is, in turn, associated with the response of U.S. rates to the same shock). In contrast, in SOAEs, the greater ==== impact of such shock on GDP is less connected to country interest rates and more associated with persistent declines in bank credit. Furthermore, in SOAEs, the dynamics of investment and unemployment are more directly impacted by global financial risk itself. Of note, from a broader view our analysis and results suggest that the GFC may have marked a turning point after which economic activity and labor markets in EMEs became, in relative terms, much less sensitive to global financial risk compared to SOAEs, with domestic factors reflected in EME interest rates becoming relatively more relevant.====The approach we use to identify global financial risk shocks is rooted in existing literature on the effects of foreign interest rate and global financial risk shocks on EME business cycles (Uribe and Yue, 2006; Akinci, 2013). In order to characterize transparently the impact of changes in global financial risk outside of the U.S., our focus is on small open economies whose response is unlikely to influence global financial risk itself. Hence our focus on an extensively-studied group of EMEs, which are characterized by being small and open, as well as SOAEs. Moreover, for better comparability with our EME country group, we explicitly consider a group of SOAEs that were not ==== impacted by the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis that followed the GFC. Our focus on two different groups of small open economies—EMEs and SOAEs—allows us to explore the extent to which distinct features of each country group can play a role in the impact of global financial risk on unemployment and aggregate economic activity.====The importance of interest rates, financial frictions, and financial shocks for aggregate fluctuations in EMEs is well known. Prominent examples include Neumeyer and Perri's (2005) and Uribe and Yue's (2006) emphasis on foreign interest rate shocks for EME business cycles and Mendoza and Yue's (2012) work on economic fundamentals and country spreads (for more recent work, see Fernández and Gulan, 2015, and Fink and Schüler, 2015). Closest to our work is Akinci (2013), who builds on Uribe and Yue's (2006) empirical methodology to study the importance of global financial risk in EME aggregate fluctuations. Horvath and Zhong (2018) explore the impact of foreign and domestic policy rates as well as global financial risk on unemployment in EMEs alone, showing that, in line with our findings, global risk has a small impact on unemployment. In addition, recent empirical work by Gilchrist and Mojon (2017) documents how aggregate economic activity and other variables of interest, including unemployment, respond to financial risk with a focus on the Euro area. Finally, other related studies center on global business cycles and the propagation mechanisms that might explain them (see, for example, Kose et al., 2012). Our work is related to this last literature only insofar as we consider global financial risk shocks as a source of fluctuations in small open economies. However, the purpose of our work is not to explain global business cycles but instead to explore how small open economies may respond differently to changes in global financial conditions, with an emphasis on differences between EMEs and SOAEs.====Relative to existing work, we (1.) analyze the potential differential responses of macro aggregates to global financial risk between EMEs and SOAEs and not in EMEs alone, thereby focusing beyond the study of EMEs, ====, and (2.) place explicit emphasis on differential unemployment dynamics in these two country groups as an important indicator of overall differences in the impact of global financial risk shocks. Of note, to the best of our knowledge, no existing papers have characterized how domestic labor markets may respond differently in EMEs and SOAEs to global financial disruptions. More broadly, our focus on unemployment is of particular relevance given the role of labor markets in household labor income and welfare, as well as the influence of financial disruptions on labor market conditions—a connection that came to the forefront of the policy debate in the midst and aftermath of the GFC.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 discusses our empirical approach. Section 4 presents the VAR-based evidence on global financial risk shocks. Section 5 discusses the potential mechanisms and country-group characteristics that may explain our findings, and summarizes an extensive series of robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.","Global financial risk, aggregate fluctuations, and unemployment dynamics",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300339,May 2019,2019,Research Article,245.0

By construction, one-sector models of trade and MP, ignore the conflicting effects that a reduction in MP frictions has on the sectoral dispersion of MP and trade shares. On the one hand, freer MP increases the dispersion of MP shares across sectors, and with it, the gains from MP. On the other hand, it reduces the heterogeneity of trade shares, since MP erodes sectoral level Ricardian comparative advantage, diminishing therefore gains from trade. These effects are driven by the disproportional allocation of MP in ==== where local firms are relatively less productive, which generates an uneven productivity boost favoring comparative disadvantage sectors, lowering the differences in observed sectoral productivities. To assess the welfare implications of this mechanism, this paper assembles a novel industry-level dataset of bilateral foreign affiliate sales for 32 countries, 9 tradable sectors and 4 non-tradeble sectors.","Multinational firms play a central role in shaping countries' patterns of production. Oftentimes, countries host large foreign multinationals in sectors where they lack major local firms. In other sectors, large local companies—which in many cases are home-based multinationals—dominate the domestic market, deterring the positioning of foreign affiliates in their operating industry. For example, the Spanish automobile industry is led by affiliates of Daimler AG, Ford, Peugeot, General Motors, Nissan, Renault, and Volkswagen, which have made Spain the world's 8th-largest producer of cars. In Italy, however, the same companies have a much smaller share of production, since prominent home-based companies, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Fiat, and Maserati, capture a dominant share of total output. A very different picture emerges in the chemical sector. In Italy, more than 300 foreign subsidiaries, led by affiliates of Roche and Sanofi-Aventis, account for 52% of production and 43% of exports in the chemical industry, whereas Repsol, the largest Spanish chemical firm, is strongly positioned at home with 40% of market share. Thus, a country may succeed not only at making products in which its domestic firms are good at producing, but also those goods in which foreign affiliates are highly productive. As a consequence, a country's comparative advantage is jointly determined by the productivities of its local producers and the foreign affiliates operating in its economy. By altering the distribution of sectoral productivities, foreign multinationals shape the patterns of cross-country trade and cross-border production.====Understanding how ==== comparative advantage—determined by the productivity of domestic firms—and ==== comparative advantage—comprising the productivity of all producers, both domestic and foreign—affect cross-border production and trade patterns is essential to asses the responses of trade and multinational production (MP) to shocks affecting the level of cross borders production frictions, including policies strengthening investor-state dispute settlement provisions in bilateral investment treaties, and policies aimed to fortify intellectually property rights. This paper shows the extent to which MP frictions and the sectoral structure of local producers' capabilities can explain cross-country differences in the industrial composition of inward MP, as well as differences in the pool of investing countries that each economy hosts.====Recent research (Ramondo, 2016; Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare, 2013; Shikher, 2014; Arkolakis et al., 2013; Tintelnot, 2017; Head and Mayer, 2018) has studied the welfare consequences of the interaction between trade and multinational production in one-sector frameworks. By introducing a multisectoral model, together with a unique industry-level dataset for 32 countries of bilateral foreign affiliate sales, this paper assesses the welfare implications of accounting for the striking observed sectoral heterogeneity in the share of output produced by foreign affiliates—or MP shares. The paper shows that—conditional on its effects on aggregate levels of trade and multinational activity—a reduction in MP frictions has opposing effects on the heterogeneity of MP and trade shares across sectors. In particular, lowering the cost of MP increases the sectoral dispersion of MP shares, but reduces the sectoral dispersion of trade shares, positively affecting the gains from MP, while diminishing the gains from trade. This is because, in a multi-sector model, as cross-border production gets easier, the higher dispersion of MP shares smooths out sectoral differences in ==== productivities, since less productive sectors host relatively more foreign affiliates, disproportionately improving the observed productivity of comparative disadvantage sectors.====The first contribution of this paper is to document how MP shares relate to countries' comparative advantage by assembling a detailed industry-level dataset of bilateral foreign affiliates' sales that distinguishes the industry of operation (====), the host country where production takes place (====), and the home country where the parent firm is located (====). Our tri-dimensional dataset, which was assembled using data from OECD, Eurostat, BEA and Orbis, provides information on production, employment and number of foreign affiliates for 32 countries, 9 tradable sectors, and 4 non-tradable sectors, averaged for the period of 2003–2012. Using this novel data set, after controlling for sector, host and source country specific characteristics, relative abundance of factors of production, corporate tax rates, and gravity related variables, we find that the allocation of MP across sectors is negatively correlated with sectoral productivity differences between local producers and foreign affiliates. In particular, we show that inward MP shares are disproportionately higher in industries where local producers are relatively less efficient, while outward MP is higher in sectors where local firms have comparative advantage. That is, foreign affiliates are more likely to succeed in those sectors in which their productivity differential relative to local producers is larger; a relationship that is shown to be robust to different samples, specifications, and estimation methods, as well as alternative measures of productivity and multinational activity.====The second contribution of this paper is to develop a multi-sector extension of the benchmark Ricardian model of trade and multinational production, (Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare, 2013), which nests ==== and ==== comparative advantage in a unified framework, enabling the measurement of the consequences of MP-related shocks on sectoral patterns of trade and production, and its welfare implications. The full model allows for export platforms,==== features asymmetric MP and trade barriers, multiple factors of production, sector specific factors and intermediate inputs intensities, a realistic input-output matrix, inter- and intra-sectoral trade, and a non-tradable sector. To highlight the novel mechanism present in the multi-sector model of trade and MP, we use a simplified environment in which trade and MP shares can be expressed as a function of the Atkinson inequality index (Atkinson, 1970). The functional form of this index fits nicely with the multiplicative nature of the model, and it is an analytically convenient measure of dispersion used here to summarize differences in productivity across sectors, as well as the sectoral heterogeneity of other model objects, such as MP and trade shares.====The first result from our model shows that the dispersion of MP shares across sectors increases with the dispersion of ==== productivities, given that less-productive sectors receive the largest fraction of MP relative to output; a prediction in line with the stylized fact mentioned above. Second, we show a systematic relationship between MP barriers and the sectoral heterogeneity of MP. Specifically, the lower the MP frictions, the more pronounced the sectoral dispersion of MP shares will be, as barriers that inhibited cross-border ownership cause an incomplete pass-through from ==== productivities to sectoral MP shares. Third, we show the existence of an inverse relationship between the sectoral dispersion of domestic trade shares and MP barriers. In other words, once sectoral productivity differences are taken into account, the lower the barriers faced by foreign companies to implement their home technologies while producing in the local market, the greater the aggregate level and the sectoral dispersion of MP shares, and the lower the aggregate level and sectoral dispersion of domestic trade shares.====Acknowledging sectoral heterogeneity in a model of trade and multinational production affects the economic mechanisms of the model, leading to considerable differences in the quantitative assessment of gains from trade, MP and openness. To show this analytically, we start by decomposing the gains from trade (GT) as the product of two factors: the aggregate and the sectoral dispersion of domestic trade shares. This decomposition enables us to neatly show how freer MP adversely affects GT, by reducing the sectoral dispersion of trade shares, as lower MP frictions diminish sector-level Ricardian comparative advantage, and therefore, inter-industry trade. This result sharply contrasts with the one obtained in one-sector models under symmetry, where even frictionless MP has no effects on trade flows. Despite the fact that in a multi-sector model gains from trade are lower with freer MP, the overall gains from openness (GO)—which include both cross-border production and trade—are larger, as the increase in gains from MP (GMP) outweighs the reduction in the gains from trade.====In order to test the main implications of the model, we rely on our rich quantitative framework and dataset to estimate the model's parameters. To this end, we estimate, for each country-sector pair, the productivity of ==== producers only, as well as the productivity of ==== producers in the economy—including local producers and foreign affiliates—in a way that is consistent with trade and MP structural gravity equations. Distinguishing productivity by ownership allows us to show that the dispersion of sectoral productivity is lower for the overall economy than for local producers only. As observed shares of inward MP are larger in sectors where local producers are relatively less efficient, the productivity enhancement due to MP is uneven and biased towards sectors in which local firms exhibit comparative disadvantage, reducing the sectoral productivity dispersion of the overall economy.====Next, the paper provides estimates of MP barriers for each source-location-sector in the sample. These frictions can be interpreted as the extent to which a company from a foreign country can make full use of the technologies developed in their source country when producing abroad. More broadly, higher frictions could be a reflection of the inherent difficulties of moving managers from their home country to distant places with different cultures and time zones, causing coordination problems with headquarters. In comparison with trade frictions, we find that, within each sector, barriers to cross-border investment are higher and more disperse. Moreover, the distribution of MP frictions across countries are highly asymmetric; that is, the barriers that a French company encounters to implement its blueprint in Slovakia differ systematically from the frictions that a Slovak affiliate encounters when it produces in France. In general, countries that serve as important sources of foreign investment, such as Germany, Japan and the United States, face lower frictions relative to Latvia and Poland when producing abroad in the same sector and host country.====After estimating the model's parameters, we proceed to calculate the gains from MP, trade and openness for the 32 countries in our sample. Results show a rich cross-country variation in welfare gains, with average values of 10.6, 8.5 and 21.0%, corresponding to GMP, GT, and GO, respectively. In our first counterfactual, we analyze the welfare impact of autarky on MP. We present the ==== and ==== welfare effects of MP liberalization, where the latter reflects the welfare impact due only to changes in the sectoral dispersion while adjusting for changes in aggregate trade and MP shares.==== This adjustment allows us to control for any changes in the aggregate MP and trade shares relative to their initial equilibrium values. Results show that gains from MP increase on average by almost 20 percentage points when MP barriers are 60% lower, of which a third (6 percentage points) are explained by changes in the dispersion of sectoral MP shares.====Our next counterfactual isolates the effects of Ricardian comparative advantage on the dispersion of MP and trade shares, and ultimately on GO. To this end, we construct a scenario exercise in which we remove the “==== comparative advantage”, while keeping other model parameters unaltered. As in (Costinot et al., 2012), to avoid any indirect terms of trade effects, we give to all other countries the same productivity patterns as the country of reference, while adjusting their absolute advantage such that relative wages are preserved in the counterfactual scenario as well as in the observed equilibrium. Results show that when countries' fundamental comparative advantage are completely eroded, the median country in our sample experiments a reduction of 20 and 19% in GMP and GO, respectively. Our third counterfactual measures the consequences for trade flows and GT of the lower dispersion of ==== productivities caused by an uneven allocation of MP across sectors. To this end, we construct a counterfactual scenario where MP only affects the average host economy productivity, while keeping relative productivity differences intact as in (Levchenko and Zhang, 2016). The results show that gains from trade will be on average 7.8% higher if MP only enhances aggregate productivity without eroding host country's comparative advantage.====Our last counterfactual explores the role of multinationals in non-tradable sectors. In particular, we ask how the presence of foreign affiliates in non-tradable sectors, such as professional and transportation services, wholesale, and retail, affects not only the competitiveness of non-tradables but also the competitiveness of manufacturing industries through their input-output linkages. This exercise is particularly interesting because: 1) in most economies non-tradable sectors represent two-thirds of total output; 2) the share of MP in non-tradable sectors is more than double that of manufacturing goods; and more importantly, 3) non-tradables are the second most demanded intermediate input for most manufacturing sectors–only surpassed by inputs from their own sector. Results show that when MP in non-tradable goods becomes prohibitively costly, real income decreases by 4.59% and gains from openness decline by 24.95%. Moreover, losing access to non-tradable intermediate inputs produced by foreign affiliates causes an increase of 1.59% in the price index of manufacturing goods as well as an increase in the overall price index of 3.37%.====This paper is closely related to recent efforts in quantifying the impact of MP in general equilibrium models (Ramondo, 2016; Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare, 2013; Shikher, 2014; Arkolakis et al., 2013; Antr'as and Yeaple, 2014; Tintelnot, 2017; Head and Mayer, 2018). All these papers are framed in one-sector environments, since they focus on the economy as a whole, or in one industry in particular. Our paper contributes to this literature by incorporating a finite number of sectors that differ in their productivity levels to evaluate the welfare effects of the interplay between the sectoral heterogeneity of MP shares and the strength of Ricardian comparative advantage. By omitting the sectoral dimension, one-sector models are silent with respect to how MP frictions and differences in sectoral productivity can affect the aggregate level and the sectoral dispersion of MP and domestic trade shares.====This paper also relates to the literature that evaluates the role of sectoral heterogeneity on gains from trade on trade only models (Costinot et al., 2012; Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare, 2014; Caliendo and Parro, 2015; Levchenko and Zhang, 2014; Ossa, 2015; Shikher, 2012). In particular, previous work has measured the consequences of the complete erosion of countries comparative advantage (Costinot et al., 2012), the welfare effects of their evolution over the last four decades (Levchenko and Zhang, 2016), as well as the hyper-specialization of exports and the high rate of turnover in a country's top export industries (Hanson et al., 2015). This paper contributes to this literature by quantifying the relevance and welfare impact of MP as a determinant of comparative advantage. Multinational production, unlike trade, entails a direct transfer of technology across countries by means of innovation in products and processes through the adoption of new machinery and organizational practices (Guadalupe et al., 2012). By introducing differences in relative sectoral productivity, we are able to show how the possibility of producing using foreign technologies increases the sectoral heterogeneity of the output share produced with the country's own technologies, while decreasing the sectoral dispersion of the share of expenditure that is satisfied through imports. This paper also contributes to the discussion of the role of a few outstandingly productive firms in shaping a country's comparative advantage (Gaubert and Itskhoki, 2018), as our paper focuses on foreign affiliates, which typically are in the upper tail of the firm's size distribution, and represent on average more than 25% of total output.====This paper advances the understanding of the relationship between multinational production and countries comparative advantage. The question of whether direct investment in acquisitions and new establishments tend to flow in the same direction as trade was posited by (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982) and also explored in (Cheng et al., 2005; Feliciano and Lipsey, 2002; Brakman et al., 2013), Neary-empirics. However, they did not find robust empirical evidence, in part due to the challenges imposed by the limited variation in their dataset, with the U.S. as the only host market. This paper contributes to this discussion by using a detailed novel dataset that significantly expands the number of countries and sectors on which we can test this relationship.====Another important strand of the literature has focused on rationalizing which firms are most likely to be picked as targets in foreign mergers and acquisitions (M&A), as well as on quantifying the productivity improvements of target firms as the result of efficiency-enhancing M&A (Branstetter, 2006; Nocke and Yeaple, 2007, Nocke and Yeaple, 2008; Head and Ries, 2008; Arnold and Javorcik, 2009: Neary, 2007; Guadalupe et al., 2012; Fons-Rosen et al., 2013).==== Recent empirical evidence suggests that multinationals do not acquire a random selection of local firms, but instead they tend to favor the acquisition of the most productive ones, a positive selection that is present across industries (Guadalupe et al., 2012; Blonigen et al., 2014). We contribute to this literature by showing that MP (including mergers and acquisitions) are higher in number and value in the target country's comparative disadvantage sectors and the acquirer country's comparative advantage sectors. Therefore, the best ==== cherries are picked by a highly productive foreign acquirer, and this happens to a greater extent in sectors for which the productivity gap between acquiree and acquirer firm is larger.==== Furthermore, (Guadalupe et al., 2012) shows that newly acquired affiliates innovate and enhance their productivity upon acquisition, and that this productivity premium increases on firms' initial productivity level as it affects their absorption capacity of new technologies. Our paper contributes to this discussion by offering a general equilibrium framework that allows us to quantify the sectoral differences of the productivity upgrade facilitated by the activity of foreign affiliates for 32 countries, 9 tradable, and 4 non-tradable sectors.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the theoretical framework and derives analytical results on the impact of sectoral dispersion in MP on gains from trade and gains from multinational activity. Section 3 discusses the sources of data and documents a negative relationship between Ricardian productivity differences and multinational production at the sectoral level. Section 4 uses the quantitative framework to estimate the parameters of the model. Section 5 presents a series of counterfactual exercises to quantitatively measure the welfare effects of multinational activity, and Section 6 concludes.",Multinational production and comparative advantage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300327,25 March 2019,2019,Research Article,246.0

However, because service trade has grown over time and now accounts for about 20% of global international transactions (and over 30% of U.S. exports), the traditional assumption that goods are tradable and services are non-tradable is increasingly inadequate.==== Our results indicate that service industries we classify as tradable account for about the same share of U.S. value added as tradable manufacturing industries. These results suggest that compared to the implied assumption in most empirical work that service industries are non-tradable, accounting for tradable services nearly doubles the international trade exposure of the American economy.====An important impediment to incorporating service trade into economic models is the lack of information on the scope and characteristics of tradable service industries. Data on international trade in services are far less detailed and comprehensive than that for merchandise trade, so current empirical studies are limited to using bilateral trade data for only a small number of broad service categories (e.g., Anderson et al. (2014); and Francois and Hoekman (2010)).==== Instead, we use a novel dataset derived from the 2007 Economic Census to present a more comprehensive and detailed picture of service trade.==== Our empirical analysis suggests aggregated data mask potentially important variation within service categories and may provide inaccurate measures of the exposure of regions to international trade.====Our dataset collects region-level information on output, demand, and production costs for almost one thousand manufacturing and service industries. However, it does not contain information on trade flows between regions. This prevents the implementation of standard estimation procedures, so-called gravity equations, which relate the volume of trade between regions to their economic size and the trade resistance between them. Instead, we develop a method that identifies the effect of trade costs from region-level information on industry output and demand. Our theoretical framework formalizes the intuition of Jensen and Kletzer (2006) and Jensen (2011) that the disparity between local supply and local demand is an indicator of the extent of trade in an industry. In our model, as trade costs increase, consumers spend an increasing fraction of their income on output produced by local firms, such that regional demand and supply converge. Our empirical method therefore uses the theoretical model to infer measures of trade costs from the observed distribution of industry output and demand. Our approach has several advantages over Jensen and Kletzer (2006) and Jensen (2011). First, the structure of the model allows us to isolate the impact of distance on trade flows by controlling for the impact of a number of other factors that affect observed trade such as differences in the elasticity of substitution and fixed costs across industries or differences in productivity across regions. Second, the model enables us to conduct simple counterfactual exercises.====In our calibration, we focus on trade costs associated with distance between producers and consumers. Services can be delivered at a distance through a variety of modes: cross-border trade (e.g., software publishing); movement of consumers (e.g., amusement parks); or movement of producers (e.g., consultants).==== However, independent of the mode of delivery, service trade implies movement across space such that, as in manufacturing, distance between producers and consumers matters. In addition to trade costs, our theoretical framework features other factors that influence the extent of trade between regions, such as differences in production costs across regions, as well as differences in product differentiation and returns to scale across industries. Because we control for these differences in our estimation and because our estimates are derived from U.S. data (where regional differences in preferences and policies are relatively small), we believe our empirical measures of trade costs reflect fundamental (i.e., technological) product or service characteristics associated with the cost of distance and, as a result, provide useful information on the potential scope for international trade in services.====In our theoretical model, trade flows between regions depend on the “phi-ness” of trade; a function of the trade costs and elasticity of substitution parameters (see Baldwin et al. (2003)). Conditional on trade costs, trade will be lower in high elasticity industries because demand is more sensitive to changes in price. Disentangling trade costs from elasticity of substitution is therefore crucial to obtain accurate measures of the impact of distance on trade flows. An important measurement challenge we face is that measures of elasticity of substitution are not readily available for service industries. Using the theoretical model as a guide, we construct measures of elasticity from data on profit margins collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Our estimates take reasonable values. The average elasticity across all industries in our sample is 7.1. For manufacturing industries, the average is 8.1; a value in line with available estimates (e.g., Broda and Weinstein (2006)).====Our calibration method generates plausible values for trade costs. Consistent with the theoretical model, our measures of trade costs are lower in industries characterized by large disparities in supply and demand within regions. To further validate our measures, we compare them to other indices of tradability that have been used in the literature. The first measure is an industry-level estimate of the trade share of output derived from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' input-output tables. The second measure uses information from the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) to estimate the average distance shipped for each of the 544 (predominantly manufacturing) NAICS 6-digit industries in scope to the CFS. As expected, our calibrated trade costs are negatively correlated with these measures. In contrast to our estimates, these measures are outcome variables that reflect variation in multiple fundamentals, only one of which is the impact of distance on trade costs. For another point comparison, we use the CFS to estimate the distance elasticity of interregional trade from a typical fixed effect gravity equation.==== By construction, the estimates we obtain from the gravity equation are closely related to the trade cost parameters in our model. In the gravity equation, an increase in the impact of distance on trade flows implies that the estimated coefficient on distance becomes more negative, whereas in our calibration it implies an increase in our measure of trade costs. As expected, these two measures of trade barriers are negatively correlated for the set of industries that appear in both datasets.====Our empirical results challenge the conventional treatment of services as non-tradable. Our analysis confirms trade costs are higher on average in the service sector, but also reveals that many service industries have estimated trade costs comparable to manufacturing industries where we observe trade. We use our measures of trade costs to classify industries into tradable and non-tradable categories. As expected, a smaller share of service industries are tradable. However, because the service sector is relatively large (accounting for about 65% of value added in the United States, compared to about 20% for manufacturing), we find that about half of the value added in tradable industries comes from the service sector. Relative to the conventional treatment of services as non-tradable, our results suggest that including tradable service industries potentially doubles the exposure of the U.S. economy to international trade.====Our analysis highlights systematic variation in industry characteristics across tradable and non-tradable industries. On average, tradable industries have higher wages and labor productivity compared to non-tradable industries. These differences persist even when comparing industries within the same sector. We interpret these patterns as evidence of differences in factor-intensity across industries. Assuming wages and labor productivity reflect unmeasured differences in workers' ability and physical or intangible assets, respectively, our results suggest tradable industries are skill- and capital-intensive compared to non-tradable ones (even in the same industry group). These results are a first step to understanding how the location of services production might respond to changes in international economic policy for services.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we motivate the intuition for our empirical strategy by documenting geographical patterns of production for several industries. In section 3, we develop a theoretical model of trade between regions to obtain an analytical expression that relates trade costs to the share of excess supply, a measure of disparity between local production and demand. In section 4, we present descriptive statistics on the share of excess supply. In section 5, we discuss the empirical implementation of our model and obtain measures of trade costs for 969 service and manufacturing industries. In section 6, we use our measures of trade costs to characterize the international trade exposure of the U.S., examine the regional distribution of tradable services, compare the characteristics of tradable and non-tradable industries, and explore the potential welfare gains from trade liberalization in services.

The onset and spread of the 2007 financial crisis highlight the importance of financial integration for international business cycle co-movements. Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2013) show that greater financial integration leads to greater business cycle synchronization during a financial crisis but leads to lower business cycle synchronization during other times. This paper embeds collateral constraint within a two-country, two-good international real business cycle model with portfolio choice to analyze the transmission mechanism of technology and financial shocks. The model illustrates that the impact of financial integration on the exchange rate movement is important in understanding business cycle synchronization. The simulation results show that the model can match the business cycle correlations in the data reasonably well.====I build a two-country model in which credit contracts are imperfectly enforceable. Each country has two types of agent, an investor and a saver. The investor can borrow but faces a collateral constraint that is tied to the value of her capital and real estate holdings. The capital that she holds can be either domestic or foreign, but the housing that she holds is only domestic. The saver is more patient than the investor and always wants to lend. The bond market is international, so the saver is allowed to lend to investors in both countries. In the model, I introduce a technology shock and a financial shock, where the latter is modeled as a shock to the collateral constraint. As I am interested in evaluating business cycle implications quantitatively, I model explicitly the endogenous labor supply and capital accumulation.====The main findings of this study are summarized as follows. First, the model shows that the degree of foreign capital exposure affects business cycle synchronization. When the technology shock is present, higher exposure to foreign capital leads to less appreciation in the real exchange rate and lower business cycle co-movements. However, when the financial shock is present, higher exposure to foreign capital leads to less depreciation in the real exchange rate and greater business cycle co-movements. This finding is consistent with the empirical evidence documented by Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2013).====Second, the model shows that except for the channels of foreign capital exposure and exchange rate adjustment, the investor's holding of housing also plays an important role in the transmission of shocks through the collateral constraint. With international financial market, although the investor only holds domestic housing and uses it as collateral, when the economy experiences a negative shock, there will be a rise in the borrowing premium in both countries, which means tightened collateral constraints and a simultaneous decline in real estate holdings in both countries. The synchronization of the borrowing premium predicted by the model is consistent with the highly correlated loan rate spreads across countries in the data.====Third, the model predicts that higher exchange rate volatility is related to lower foreign capital exposure. This result is consistent with the empirical evidence documented by Fidora et al. (2007), who found a positive and significant relationship between real exchange rate volatility and equity home bias.====This study is related to the large body of literature on financial frictions in an open economy context. Early work includes Iacoviello and Minetti (2006), Gertler et al. (2007), and Faia (2007). However, none of these studies address the impact of financial frictions when constrained agents hold foreign capital. Following the 2007 financial crisis, the literature has focused on the role of financial integration in the transmission of shocks with financial frictions. Examples include Devereux and Yetman (2010), Kollmann et al. (2011), Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2013), Kamber and Thoenissen (2013), and Perri and Quadrini (2018), of which Devereux and Yetman (2010) is closest to my work, as they study financial frictions and capital portfolio choice in a two-country, one-good model. My study differs from theirs in three ways. First, I incorporate capital accumulation and endogenous labor choice into the model to evaluate the business cycle implications quantitatively. The benchmark model can match the cross-country correlations in the data reasonably well. In this respect, my paper is also related to the literature on international business cycle co-movements, starting with Backus et al. (1992). Second, my model allows the investor to use housing as part of the collateral, so variations in the housing price and housing holdings have direct effects on the investor's collateral constraint. Third, I explicitly examine the role of fluctuations in terms of trade on the transmission of shocks across countries. The third aspect differentiates my paper from Kollmann et al. (2011) and Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2013), who study the importance of the degree of banking exposure under a two-country, one-good framework. Kamber and Thoenissen (2013) take a similar approach to that of Kollmann et al. (2011) but allow for changes in the terms of trade; however, they assume a small open economy setting, rather than two countries of the same size.",International business cycles and financial frictions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300303,May 2019,2019,Research Article,248.0

Using a local labor market approach, we investigate the causal effects of tariff reforms implemented in South Africa between 1994 and 2004 on labor market outcomes at the individual level. More specifically, we construct a district-level measure of exposure to tariff reductions equal to a weighted average of ","Over the past two decades, barriers to trade have been rapidly reduced around the world, and exports from the developing world—particularly from Asia and Latin America—have concurrently surged. A large body of empirical work finds evidence that these trade reforms generated substantial shifts in developing country economies.==== On the one hand, positive shocks that increased access to developed country markets reduced poverty and shifted labor away from agriculture in Vietnam and China (McCaig, 2011; McCaig and Pavcnik, 2018; Erten and Leight, 2017). On the other hand, domestic tariff cuts that increased competition from imports slowed the pace of poverty reduction and wage growth in India and Brazil (Topalova, 2010; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2017a).====However, much less is known about the impact of trade liberalization on economies in sub-Saharan Africa.==== South Africa has been a leader in trade liberalization in the region; following its democratic transition in 1994, the government introduced substantial and relatively abrupt tariff cuts as part of a broad post-apartheid liberalization process (Belli et al., 1993; Edwards, 2005). Nonetheless, the economy's subsequent evolution has been characterized by consistently weak levels of employment generation (Banerjee et al., 2008; Leibbrandt et al., 2010; Statistics South Africa, 2018). In addition, the South African labor market has several unusual features that may affect the response to trade shocks: the base level of unemployment is high, the informal sector is small and exhibits high barriers to entry compared to other middle-income economies, wages are relatively rigid due to a strong presence of unions in the formal sector, and the manufacturing sector was underdeveloped even at the initiation of liberalization.====In this paper, we investigate the effects of rapid trade liberalization in South Africa, focusing on substitution of workers from tradable to non-tradable production, from formal to informal employment, and from employment to unemployment. The impact of tariff reductions on labor market adjustment is a priori ambiguous. The reductions in import tariffs are likely to increase the demand for imported goods by reducing their prices. On the one hand, access to cheaper intermediate inputs may lead to a reduction in production costs and increase profitability in both traded and non-traded goods sectors (De Loecker et al., 2016). On the other hand, the increase in import competition may directly displace workers in traded industries, and may also indirectly displace workers in non-traded industries via local demand effects (Acemoglu et al., 2016).====This paper presents the first causal evidence around the effects of a quasi-exogenous reduction in import tariffs on local economies in South Africa. The previous literature analyzing this shock has generally focused on estimates using computable general equilibrium models, where the results may be sensitive to the elasticity parameters employed,==== and studies employing decomposition techniques or industry-level correlations between import competition and labor market outcomes.==== In contrast, we use a local labor market approach to estimate the causal effects of regional exposure to tariff reductions on labor market outcomes employing individual level data between 1994 and 2004, the period of rapid trade liberalization in South Africa.====More specifically, we construct a variable capturing exposure to tariff cuts at the level of the local economy, here characterized as the magisterial district, equal to a time-varying weighted average of industry-level tariffs. The weights are constituted by industry employment shares as observed prior to the initiation of liberalization in 1994. South Africa's liberalization entailed drastic reductions in overall trade protection and a decline in the variation of trade protection across industries, implying large crossindustry variation in tariff reductions; moreover, the industrial composition of employment varies significantly across South African districts. The combination of variation in cross-industry tariff changes and variation in industrial composition across districts allow us to identify the effect of liberalization on local labor market outcomes. Our empirical strategy in this respect follows a large and growing literature, including Topalova, 2007, Topalova, 2010, McCaig (2011), Kovak (2013), and Autor et al. (2013), analyzing the effects of trade exposure on poverty and local labor market outcomes in India, Vietnam, Brazil, and the United States, respectively; Kovak (2013) also provides evidence of the theoretical foundations for this empirical strategy.====Using labor force survey data from 1994 to 2004, we estimate the effects of regional tariff declines on a range of labor market outcomes, examining adjustment along several margins including shifts between employment, unemployment, and nonparticipation, tradable and non-tradable employment, and formal and informal employment; we also evaluate changes in monthly earnings. After analyzing average effects at the individual level, we also examine heterogeneity by education, race, gender, location, and age. Finally, we investigate whether regional tariff cuts induced any migration away from harder hit districts, or generated shifts in patterns of access to government transfers in more strongly affected districts.====South Africa's labor market has a number of unusual characteristics that may influence the response of local economies to trade liberalization, as detailed further in Section 2.2. First, it has one of the highest and most persistent rates of unemployment in the world. As of 2018, unemployment was 28% employing the narrower definition of unemployment, and 35% including discouraged workers. These high rates of unemployment may pose a significant challenge for workers displaced by unfavorable trade shocks in finding new employment opportunities, given the large pool of searchers. Second, the informal sector is relatively small and exhibits high barriers to entry (Kingdon and Knight, 2007); a weak and slow-growing informal sector may have a limited capacity to absorb workers displaced from formal employment. Third, wages are relatively rigid given the significant role played by trade unions and formal bargaining mechanisms in the determination of wages, and these institutional constraints may limit firms' response to trade shocks along the wage margin (Godfrey et al., 2007; Magruder, 2012). Fourth, the manufacturing sector was relatively underdeveloped even at the beginning of liberalization compared to other middle-income economies (Tregenna, 2011b). These distinct characteristics of the labor market suggest a pattern of adjustment that may be qualitatively and quantitatively different from the pattern observed in other liberalizing middle-income countries.====Our results suggest that workers employed in districts facing larger tariff reductions experience a significant decline in employment, driven primarily by a decline in manufacturing sector employment, relative to workers in districts facing smaller tariff reductions. We find no evidence of labor reallocation from manufacturing into other traded sectors including mining and agriculture, or into non-traded sectors (i.e., services). Instead, displaced workers are more likely to become discouraged unemployed workers or exit the labor force entirely. Using the broad definition of unemployment including both searching and discouraged unemployed workers (Statistics South Africa, 2018), we find evidence of an increase in broad unemployment, as well as an increase in nonparticipation. However, when examining adjustment to tariff cuts along the intensive margin, there is no evidence of a significant impact on monthly earnings, hourly wages, or hours of work conditional on employment.====We also evaluate whether regional tariff declines induce workers to substitute from formal to informal employment, and find no evidence that growth in the informal sector absorbs displaced workers. Rather, workers employed in districts facing larger tariff reductions experience significant and similar declines in both formal and informal employment, and this pattern is consistent across a range of definitions of informality, including working in an unregistered enterprise, working without a written contract, and self-employment. While the decline in formal employment is concentrated in manufacturing, the decline in informal sector employment is mainly driven by a contraction in agricultural employment.====When examining heterogeneity with respect to education and race, the observed employment effects are consistent for individuals at varying education levels. However, among relatively less educated workers, black and colored workers face a higher likelihood of employment loss. By contrast, there is no evidence of significant heterogeneity with respect to gender, age, or location.====Finally, we find no evidence of a significant impact of tariff declines on migration patterns using a subsample of survey years in which migration data was reported (1994–1998), implying that workers do not respond to depressed local labor market conditions by migrating to less exposed regions. By contrast, workers in harder hit areas are more likely to receive government transfers, including disability grants, child support grants, and dependent care grants. This result echoes the findings from the U.S. literature on import competition from China (Autor et al., 2013), suggesting that displaced workers are more likely to rely on social safety nets in response to the deterioration in local labor market conditions.====We conduct a number of robustness checks to verify that our results are consistent across alternative specifications. Given that the tariff cuts were highest for the textile sector and lowest for the coal mining sector, we show that the results are robust to excluding districts with relatively high shares of initial textile or coal employment; we also find similar patterns when the analysis is conducted at the district rather than the individual level. Additionally, we demonstrate that the results are not driven by differential pre-trends observed prior to trade liberalization.",Trade liberalization and local labor market adjustment in South Africa,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300200,May 2019,2019,Research Article,249.0

A more recent literature has shown the importance of product quality at the microeconomic level: in addition to being one of the main sources of firm heterogeneity,==== the quality supplied by firms impacts the relative demand for inputs, which makes it decisive to understand the link between globalization and inequalities.==== These findings triggered an increasing demand from trade economists for disaggregated data on product quality. However, despite this need, estimating firm-level quality on trade data remains an empirical challenge: traditional techniques developed in Industrial Organization cannot be applied to datasets in which product characteristics are not observed,==== which is typically the case with international trade data.====In this paper, we propose and implement a new empirical methodology to estimate product quality at the firm level. We create a new instrument for prices, based on exchange rate variations interacted with firm-specific importing shares, that allows us to consistently estimate demand equations in the absence of observable product characteristics. Implementing this methodology using customs data from France, we first document the reliability of our estimation: we compare the estimated price elasticities and measures of quality with industry and firm characteristics as well as alternative measures of quality. Then, we employ the obtained quality measures to study the link between export performance and quality: we show that firms which add products or destinations in their portfolio simultaneously exhibit an increasing quality. Importantly, using prices, a common proxy for quality, to study this question leads to a different conclusion.====The main contribution of this paper is to provide a new method to estimate quality using trade data. We estimate quality from the demand side. The main challenge one faces when estimating demand functions is to deal with the endogeneity of prices: prices are likely to be correlated to demand shocks, because quality is costly to produce.==== Consequently, researchers have used unit values or prices as proxies for quality, or have estimated demand equations in contexts where unobserved vertical differentiation is limited.==== To address this endogeneity issue, we construct a novel instrument for prices, exploiting fluctuations in exchange rates. These fluctuations, interacted with firm-specific import shares, shift a firm's costs of importing goods. As the firm passes importing cost variations to its consumers, the instrument generates firm-specific export price and sales variations. These variations are arguably exogenous to unobserved demand shocks (e.g., quality shocks) and allow us to identify the price-elasticity of exports. Quality is then identified at the firm, destination, product, year level, from the residual variations of demand once price variations have been controlled for; a strategy that is present throughout the literature.====The implementation of this method using customs data from France, supports the validity of the procedure. First, we find that the import-weighted exchange rate, our instrument, is strongly and positively correlated to export prices charged by firms. This is consistent with the assumption we make to motivate the instrumentation, namely that exchange rates shift a firm's production costs. Second, in order to evaluate the ability of our instrument to correct for the endogeneity of prices, we estimate the demand equation using both ordinary least squares and instrumental techniques. Our instrumental variable procedure affects the estimates of price-elasticities consistently with a correction of an omitted variable bias: while ordinary least squares estimates deliver a low (in absolute value) price-elasticity (−0.8), the instrumental variable approach estimates an average price-elasticity of demand of −4.3, consistent with existing studies in the industrial organization literature. Moreover, elasticities estimated at a more disaggregated level are positively correlated with existing estimates from Broda and Weinstein (2006) and Soderbery (2015), and, as expected, negatively correlated with a measure of vertical differentiation from Sutton (2001).====We then investigate the properties of the quality estimates obtained from the procedure. We show that the dispersion of these estimates within a market is positively correlated with existing measures from Khandelwal (2010). Moreover, we directly relate our quality measure to quality measures at the firm-level. A natural benchmark is provided by Crozet et al. (2012) who use one of the very few “direct” measure of firm-specific quality present in the literature, by relying on ratings attributed by an expert to a sample of French Champagne producers. We compare these ratings with our estimated quality of exported Champagne and find a positive and strongly significant correlation. Similarly, we find that the obtained quality measures are intuitively correlated with firms characteristics and in particular the average wage paid by firms.====Finally, we compare our estimated quality measures with export prices, the most commonly employed proxy for quality. We show that prices and quality are positively correlated in the cross-section of firms, as well as over time within a firm. However, this correlation is significantly stronger for vertically differentiated markets. In other words, prices are informative on quality, but less so in more homogeneous sectors. Then, we show that this imperfect correlation between prices and quality can be misleading when studying the role of quality in explaining export performance. In particular, we show that firms adding destinations or varieties to their portfolio do so as they experience an increase in the estimated quality of their products. On the contrary, using prices to study this question leads to contradictory answers as prices tend to increase with the addition of a destination, and decrease with the addition of a product. We argue these results highlight the superiority of our measure over prices that conflate many factors other than vertical differentiation.====This paper is directly related to the literature aiming to measure quality using trade data. Most of the literature back up quality measures from the estimation of a demand system, following the tradition in Industrial Organization.==== In particular, we can cite Hallak and Schott (2011) and Khandelwal (2010) who rely on an instrumental variable approach to identify quality at the country-product level using trade data. To be applied at the firm-product level, their methods require an instrument for prices which varies across firms. We provide such an instrument. Gervais (2015) and Roberts et al. (2017) also estimate quality at the firm level by instrumenting prices. However, these studies use instruments, respectively physical productivity and wages, which are questionable if quality varies over time, within the firm. More recently, Fontagné et al. (2018) develop a strategy using variations in electricity prices across French firms. By contrast, our strategy relies on an instrument available to most trade economists as it can be constructed solely from customs data.====Because of the difficulty of estimating demand equations at the firm level, in the absence of product characteristics, researchers have relied on alternative strategies: Khandelwal et al. (2013) construct quality by calibrating price-elasticity with estimates from Broda and Weinstein (2006). The relevance of these price-elasticities estimates is open to question as they are obtained from country-level data. Alternatively, demand equations have been estimated in contexts where unobserved vertical differentiation is limited: for instance, Broda and Weinstein (2010) and Handbury (2012) use barcode-level data, whereas Foster et al. (2008) restrict their analysis to homogeneous products. Finally, another strand of the literature has relied on structural models to overcome the endogeneity problem when estimating demand equations.==== In comparison to these methods, our paper provides an instrument for export prices based on trade data, which allows the consistent estimation of demand functions for potentially all industries and under weaker assumptions.====A number of papers have used prices to investigate the role played by quality in explaining export performance across firms. Most of these papers used output and input prices as proxy for quality: we can cite for instance Kugler and Verhoogen (2012) and Manova and Zhang (2012) that document quality variations across firms, and within firm across destinations, using firm-level or customs data. While the use of prices is appropriate in the context of their studies,==== we believe the use of prices as proxy for quality can be problematic in other situations. Indeed, while product quality usually increases the cost of a good, many other factors determine the price charged by a firm for its product. Moreover, the presence of multi-products firms makes the use of prices even more so challenging since firms self-select their set of products based on their quality. Manova and Yu (2017) studies the complexity of the relationship between prices and product quality in the context of multi-product firms.====Finally, the use of exchange rates as an instrument for prices links our paper to Berman et al. (2012) and Amiti et al. (2014). These studies empirically analyze the firm-level pass-through from exchange rates to export prices. However, while both works are interested in the heterogeneity of the pass-through across firms, we only use the effect of exchange rates on export prices as a first stage to a demand function estimation. More recently, Amiti et al. (2018) studies the price setting of firms in response to shocks on their costs and the prices of their competitors. In this context, they also use exchange rates to obtain exogenous variations in the cost of imported inputs.====This paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we derive a simple model of demand with vertically-differentiated goods and present our identification strategy to consistently estimate demand equations using trade data. In Section 3, we describe the French customs data used for the implementation and show the results of the estimation. Section 4 describes the relevance of the quality estimates we obtain by relating them to existing measures. Moreover, we explore the link between these measures and prices to show that using prices as proxy can be misleading in some contexts.

We use Brownian motion and Poisson shocks—a modeling method in the literature on corporate default known as Lévy processes—to approximate a decomposition of the output process into a smooth and a jump component. Using an ==== model of debt repudiation, we show that the Brownian part explains the counter-cyclical behavior of the current account, and the Poisson part explains the risk of default—thus enabling our model to account for key stylized facts regarding sovereign risk.","The literature on sovereign debt has attempted to fit simultaneously the data on debt levels and on default probabilities. In the models inspired by Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), the modeling trade-off has been the following. Either the cost of default is set to low levels: in that case the country will often default, as in the data, but will also be rationed to abnormally low levels of debt compared to historical averages. Or the other way around: if the cost of default is high, then the country can borrow in quantities observed in the data, but it will then default too rarely compared to real life. Original work by Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) or Arellano (2008) for instance successfully matched the probability of default but at the expense of very low sustainable debt levels. A newer generation of models (notably Hatchondo and Martinez, 2009, followed by Chatterjee and Eyigungor, 2012 and Bianchi et al., 2013) has managed to fit both moments by postulating a pro-cyclical cost of default, as in Arellano (2008). In these models, a recession has the potential to create a default, as the cost becomes virtually nil when the output gap is large, while very expensive in good states. Further insights have been gained in these papers by incorporating a richer structure regarding the maturity of debt. Long-term debt, by reducing the refinancing risk, allows countries to borrow more than suggested by the short-term debt model.====Another major fact emphasized by this literature has to do with the counter-cyclicality of the current account. When output is rising, countries typically borrow more, and the opposite happens when it is falling. This fact is at odds with the permanent income version of the first generation of balance of payments models.====In the wake of these researches, our paper provides a new perspective for characterizing sovereign debt profiles. Our key insight is that the pattern of output (==== the stochastic structure of GDP) is critical in determining a country's borrowing and default decisions. This idea—that the nature of uncertainty about the fundamental matters—is standard in structural models of firm default. By drawing on the mathematical theory of Lévy processes, this strand of the corporate finance literature has successfully addressed several puzzles regarding default risk and credit spreads (from the early works referenced in Sundaresan (2000) to the present day).====Our paper builds on this approach and shows how incorporating both a smooth==== (“Brownian”) and a jump (“Poisson”) component into the GDP process helps shedding light on the issues and challenges to the sovereign debt literature mentioned above. Specifically, our main results are the following.====In the context of sovereign risk, in which default is an option to be compared to the alternative of continuing to service the debt, we reach the striking conclusion that when debt is short-term, default is only driven by the Poisson part of the GDP process. A smooth stochastic process does not produce default for reasons similar to the deterministic case: with the arrival of new information, the sovereign always prefers to adapt its debt rather than risking to drift towards a costly default. On the other hand, the smooth part of the stochastic process produces a contra-cyclical current account, consistent with empirical evidence. This feature is not captured by the Poisson shocks. In other words, two key stylized facts regarding debtor countries, counter-cyclicality of their current account and high exposure to risk of default, while obviously stemming from a common cause—the willingness to borrow extensively—do not proceed from the same risk factor. Our analysis indicates that the data of a debt-to-GDP ratio is not by itself sufficient to determine whether a sovereign will default: the nature of shocks to GDP is key to understand a country's level and terms of borrowing and default decisions.====How do our results compare to standard models of corporate default? In a Merton model of default (Merton, 1974), a Brownian process does generate a risk of default at maturity. The key reason behind the discrepancy between the Merton models and ours has to do not only with the endogeneity of default, but with the endogeneity and the frequency of the decision to borrow. The borrower, in our model, has the ability to control ==== its debt, adapting to the fundamental. In the original Merton model, debt is exogenous and default can only occur at maturity. In other seminal models of corporate finance (Leland, 1994 and Leland and Toft, 1996), default is endogenous; in these models, however, the decision to borrow is only taken once. Obviously, if the frequency of decision-making is too small to enable the country to adjust to shocks to the fundamental, default can't be ruled out, whatever the shape of the fundamental process. Indeed, in our own framework, a longer maturity has the potential of raising the risk of default (as in Nuño and Thomas, 2015 or Hatchondo et al., 2016).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the existing models on sovereign debt. Section 3 presents the model setup. Section 4 analyzes how default in equilibrium depends on the nature (Brownian or Poisson) of the stochastic process driving output. We use the discretized version on the Brownian model developed by Cox et al. (1979) to show the key result of the paper: at equilibrium, the risk of default arises from the Poisson stochastic process only, not from the Brownian part. Section 5 presents calibrated results illustrating the properties of the theoretical model; we also analyze how the maturity structure of debt comes into the picture. We show that the Brownian part is key to understand the countercyclical nature of the current account. In line with the results obtained by Nuño and Thomas (2015) and Hatchondo and Martinez (2009), we also show that long maturities are associated with positive default, although, in the context of our model, we also show that such strategy is not welfare improving. Section 6 offers a deeper look at the properties of the model in the limit of continuous time: in this limit, we show that the country must entirely renounce leveraging the Brownian part of GDP; by constrast, it does leverage the Poisson part.

Using the two most influential measures of Chinese exposure, we find that the China shock affects U.S. employment mainly through deaths of establishments. At the commuting-zone level, we find evidence of large job reallocation from the Chinese-competition exposed sector to the nonexposed sector. Moreover, we demonstrate that the job-flow effects of the China shock are fundamentally different from those of a more general adverse shock affecting the U.S. demand for domestic labor.","Net employment changes conceal large changes in gross job flows (Davis et al., 1996). Hence, to properly assess the costs and benefits of a shock that affects U.S. labor markets, it is crucial to understand not only the shock's net employment effects but also its impact on gross job creation and destruction.==== This paper performs an analysis of U.S. gross job flows in response to a shock that has reshaped the international economic order: the fast rise of China as the world's largest trader.====For the U.S. and other countries, the ‘China shock’ has been found responsible for good and (mostly) bad outcomes such as net job losses (Autor et al., 2013; Pierce and Schott, 2016), higher innovation (Bloom et al., 2016), higher rates of drug overdoses and suicides (Pierce and Schott, forthcoming), poor marriage prospects for young men (Autor et al., forthcoming), and political polarization (Autor et al., 2016). The economic, social, and political consequences of the China shock in the U.S. have their roots not only in its net effect on the labor market, but also on the characteristics of its associated job churning process. This paper's epigraph, for example, shows President Trump appealing to his base by reminding them of a particular form of job destruction: plant deaths, which he has repeatedly attributed to trade during his campaign and presidency. Despite their policymaking importance, little attention has been devoted to study the dynamics of gross job flows due to the China shock.====This paper closes this gap by estimating the impact of the China shock on each of the components of U.S. job flows at both the industry and commuting zone levels. We separate gross job creation into its births and expansions components, and gross job destruction into its deaths and contractions components. Moreover, to assess the generality of our results, we perform our analysis using the two most influential measures of the China shock in the recent literature: the increase in Chinese import penetration in the U.S. (from Autor et al., 2013), and the U.S. trade policy change that granted Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status to China (from Pierce and Schott, 2016—PS hereafter). To guide our empirical exercise we build on the comprehensive work of Acemoglu et al. (2016)—AADHP hereafter—who perform both an industry-level analysis and a local labor markets analysis of the China shock on net employment changes.====Our analysis makes three important and novel contributions. First, we show that Chinese-induced net job destruction in the U.S. is mainly driven by an increase in the rate of job destruction due to deaths of establishments. The implications of the deaths result can range from longer-lasting negative effects in regional and local markets to political candidates effectively exploiting the result for political gain. Second, at the commuting zone level we find evidence of job reallocation from the Chinese-competition-exposed sector to the nonexposed sector. And third, we establish the distinctiveness of the China shock by showing that its effects on gross job flows are fundamentally different from those of a general adverse shock to the U.S. demand for domestic labor.====These results arise from the estimation of specifications with two stacked periods (1992–1999 and either 1999–2007 or 1999–2011), where the dependent variable is a measure of net or gross employment change, and the main regressor is one of the two measures of the China shock (either import exposure or PNTR exposure). For the industry-level analysis, the net dependent variable is the log change in industry employment, while for the local labor markets analysis we instead use sectoral employment-to-population ratios at the commuting zone level. Net employment responses are the result of linear combinations of the four gross job-flow components so that, by construction, linear combinations of the China shock coefficients from the gross job-flow regressions add up to the coefficient from the net change regression; hence, this framework provides a clear-cut estimation of the contribution of each gross job flow on net and total Chinese-induced job reallocation.====The deaths result is robust for both measures of the China shock. It appears at the industry level for the direct effect of the China shock on manufacturing employment, and it appears at the commuting-zone level for the effects of local Chinese exposure on the Chinese-competition-exposed sector. Across specifications, the estimated share of deaths in total Chinese-induced gross job reallocation ranges between 55 and 95%. To shed light on the characteristics of dying establishments, we sort them within industries into low, middle, and high productivity terciles based on labor productivity. In line with previous industry-level studies, we find that the lowest tercile is disproportionately more affected by the China shock (its share in death-driven job losses is higher than its share in manufacturing employment); however, in absolute terms the highest tercile accounts for about 40% of job destruction by deaths.====In contrast to AADHP, the commuting zone level analysis in this paper finds evidence of Chinese-induced job reallocation from the exposed sector to the nonexposed sector. The nonexposed sector is indirectly affected by the China shock through job reallocation effects and aggregate demand effects. These indirect channels have opposite effects on employment in the nonexposed sector (they cancel each other out), and therefore it is not surprising that previous studies have not found evidence of their existence when looking at net employment changes. This paper is not only able to find statistically significant evidence of ==== job reallocation effects, but by focusing on all the job flow components, it is also able to capture evidence of these counteracting indirect effects.====Highlighting the benefits of looking at gross job flows, we also find evidence of job reallocation ==== the exposed sector; this result is impossible to detect when looking only at net employment responses. Moreover, the large and positive net job reallocation from the exposed sector to the nonexposed nontradable sector happens in spite of a large increase in the latter sector's rate of job destruction by deaths (evidence of aggregate demand effects), which is dominated by an even larger increase in the rate of job creation by births (evidence of job reallocation effects). When using import exposure as the measure of the China shock, the net job creation in the nonexposed sector is as large as the net job destruction in the exposed sector, resulting in an almost neutral net effect of the China shock.====Finally, our local labor markets analysis demonstrates the uniqueness of the gross employment effects of the China shock. Although previous contributions have noted the negative net employments effects of Chinese exposure in the U.S., they cannot establish whether the effects of the China shock on jobs are similar to the effects of a generic adverse shock affecting the U.S. demand for labor. Using a Bartik shock variable at the commuting zone level, which accounts for national changes in labor demand while taking into account regional specialization patterns, we show that the effects of the China shock on gross job flows are fundamentally different from the effects of a generic adverse labor demand shock. While an adverse Bartik shock causes net job destruction mainly through a reduction in the rates of job creation by births and expansions, the net job destruction caused by the China shock is driven by the increase in deaths.====This paper uses the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database to calculate gross and net job flows. NETS has strengths as well as limitations. Its main advantage is that its license does not impose any confidentiality restrictions and can be used in any computer or location, as opposed to the comparable Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), which can only be accessed—after a multi-step approval process—in secure Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC) locations subject to strong confidentiality restrictions and frequent disclosure reviews. The main limitation of NETS is its large degree of stickiness in yearly employment changes, which is a consequence of extensive use of rounding and imputation, especially for small establishments and early years in the survey. By calculating job flows over seven-, eight-, and twelve-year periods, we are confident that our empirical analysis largely avoids the NETS stickiness problem (Neumark et al., 2007 verify that using three-year differences avoids most of the problem).====Nevertheless, our comparison between the County Business Patterns (CBP) data of AADHP—which has the same source as the LBD—and NETS shows industry-level correlations for stacked differences in employment and establishment counts that are relatively low (0.695 and 0.331).==== Moreover, our assessment shows large employment differences between CBP and NETS across different sectors, suggesting important industry-classification discrepancies between them. In light of these data issues, which are likely to reflect the lower quality of NETS when compared to Census's data, the results of this paper should be taken as the first attempt to fully disentangle the effects of the China shock on U.S. job flows and should be validated using the LBD.====In the following, Section 2 provides the background for our paper, and Section 3 describes our data and provides an overview of the evolution of U.S. job flows. Sections 4 and 5 present our empirical analysis of the impact of Chinese exposure on job flows, starting with the industry-level analysis and then moving to the local labor markets approach.

To control for endogeneity bias due to selection into foreign ownership, we combine a difference-in-differences approach with a propensity score weighting estimator. Our results provide novel evidence that foreign-acquired firms actively raise the skills of their workforce in response to the acquisition by hiring high-skilled workers and providing worker training. To pin down the mechanism, we exploit unique information on whether firms use their foreign parent in exporting to foreign markets. Our results suggest a fundamental role for market access through the foreign parent in explaining skill upgrading in foreign-acquired firms. We reveal substantial productivity gains within foreign-acquired firms and we show that these gains derive from a concurrent effort to raise worker skills and adopt more advanced technology, suggesting a skill bias in technological innovations. We develop a simple theoretical model of foreign ownership featuring technology-skill complementarities in production that can rationalize our findings.","A prominent stylized fact in the trade literature is that workers in firms affiliated with foreign multinationals are strikingly different from workers in non-affiliate firms. They stick out as more educated and skilled, as more productive, and as earning higher wages (Heyman et al., 2007; Huttunen, 2007; Hijzen et al., 2013). Where do these differences come from? Two explanations have been proposed. The first is a selection effect, whereby foreign multinationals, instead of acquiring domestic firms at random, target highly productive firms with an exceptional workforce (‘cherry-picking’) (Almeida, 2007). The second explanation is the existence of a treatment effect of foreign ownership, implying active skill upgrading that would not have occurred had the firm remained in domestic ownership. Since especially the second explanation can have strong economic implications for domestic workers, sorting out these scenarios is of central interest to both policymakers and academics.====In this paper, we conduct an in-depth micro-level investigation into the effects of foreign ownership on worker skills. For this purpose, we exploit within-firm variation in ownership structure induced by foreign acquisitions in Spain. To credibly disentangle effects due to treatment versus selection, we combine a difference-in-differences approach with a suitable propensity score reweighting estimator. Our results provide novel evidence that foreign-acquired firms actively raise the skills of their workforce in response to the acquisition. Since we control for ‘cherry-picking’ in our analysis, our estimates suggest a ==== interpretation of the effect. While this finding is of obvious policy relevance, identifying the underlying economic mechanism is challenging. There are several views on why foreign-owned firms might raise the skills of their workforce beyond the level of domestically owned firms. One view is that foreign ownership alleviates credit constraints and thus allows firms to move closer to their first-best investment levels (Harrison and McMillan, 2003). Another view is that foreign multinationals transfer superior technology with potentially higher skill requirements to their affiliated firms (Caves, 1996, chapter 7). Previous research has been limited in its ability to sort out these and other possibilities, yet this is crucial for devising and selecting among policy alternatives.====The contribution of our paper is to overcome the limitations of previous research and pinpoint the precise mechanism by which firms respond to foreign acquisitions through skill upgrading. Since we find no evidence for either the credit or the technology transfer channel in our data, we focus on an entirely different mechanism, viz. the role of market access through the foreign parent. Our premise is that firms are able to tap into a larger customer base if the foreign parent entertains an international distribution network. This idea finds strong support in our data, which includes information on whether firms use the foreign parent as a distribution channel for their exports, or whether they export through other means.====Our empirical analysis draws upon Spanish firm-level data from the Encuesta Sobre Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE) for the period 1998–2013.==== This data-set is exceptionally well suited for our purposes due to its breadth and level of detail.==== It collects information, not only about the ownership structure of firms or the means by which they access foreign markets, but also about various dimensions of skills, such as the workforce composition regarding education, the training of workers in various different fields, as well as the hiring of recent university graduates. In addition, it includes information on innovation activities, technology imports, and the financial situation of firms. The richness of our data enables us to provide substantive evidence that market access through the foreign parent—coupled with technology-skill complementarities in production—is crucial in explaining skill upgrading in foreign-acquired firms. At the same time, it allows us to minimize plausible alternative explanations for skill upgrading, viz. the relaxation of credit constraints following acquisition or technology transfers from the foreign parent to the domestic affiliate.====Specifically, we generate three sets of empirical results. First, we present robust evidence for skill upgrading caused by foreign acquisitions. Skill upgrading comes in two forms: first, an increase in the share of high-skilled workers due to a shift in the hiring policy towards fresh university graduates; and second, an increase in worker training, not just overall, but also specifically in those fields that are closely related to the production technology of the firm (engineering and IT). Importantly, both forms of skill upgrading occur simultaneously with the adoption of higher levels of technology following acquisition. Moreover, while skill upgrading is present in ==== acquisitions, we show that this is not the case in ==== acquisitions. This is consistent with the idea that the cross-border dimension of the acquisition is crucial in facilitating access to foreign markets, and thus in understanding skill upgrading on the part of the acquired firm.====Secondly, we inquire into the exact mechanism behind these results, and demonstrate that market access through the foreign parent clearly dominates other plausible channels. Since our data identify precisely which firms rely on their foreign parent in gaining access to foreign markets, we can use this information to discriminate within the group of foreign-acquired firms. As it turns out, skill upgrading (whether through hiring or training) is found just for those firms that use their foreign parent for exporting, but not for other firms. To further strengthen these results and rule out both the credit and the technology transfer channel, we show that there are no changes in key financial figures (debt share, debt maturity, and debt service ratio) following acquisition, and that skill investments respond neither to the financial situation of firms nor to whether or not they import technology from abroad.====Finally, we investigate potential complementarities between technology and skills in the production process. We first show that firm output increases by >10% one year after the acquisition. We then proceed by showing that the variety of actions taken by the firm in response to the acquisition—innovation, hiring of high-skilled workers, and worker training—explain most, if not all, of this increase. In addition, we show that innovation ==== with both forms of skill upgrading. This finding suggests that technology and skills complement one another in production, and supports the notion that technological progress that occurs in relation to foreign acquisitions is—at least in the case of Spain and for the period we investigate—skill biased.====There is no theoretical model available in the literature that can jointly explain the rich pattern of effects of foreign acquisitions on skills, technology, and firm performance, as found in our empirical analysis. We therefore complete our analysis by developing such a model focusing on the role of foreign multinationals in facilitating access to foreign markets (market size effect). In the model, firms can adjust skills via two margins: first, the composition of the workforce regarding high- and low-skilled labor; and second, the provision of worker training augmenting the productivity of all workers regardless of skill type. Consistent with the evidence from a number of carefully executed empirical studies, we assume that both margins are subject to a complementary relationship with the (endogenous) technology level of the firm.==== Our model shows how improved foreign market access through the foreign parent with a corresponding increase in revenues creates incentives for firms, not only to innovate, but also to raise the level of worker training and the share of high-skilled workers in the firm.====Our paper contributes to several strands of the literature. First, it contributes to the literature on the nexus between foreign direct investment (FDI) and the relative demand for skilled labor. Influential empirical studies at the industry level are Blonigen and Slaughter (2001), Fabbri et al. (2003), and Taylor and Driffield (2005), while more recent papers studying the effects of foreign ownership use firm- or plant-level data, e.g. Almeida (2007), Huttunen (2007), and Hijzen et al. (2013). This literature, in our view, has produced somewhat mixed evidence.==== Our contribution is to lay bare, both theoretically and empirically, one important channel by which FDI in the form of foreign acquisitions leads to skill upgrading.==== Moreover, the use of rich survey data allows us to study within-firm adjustments, not just in the share of high-skilled workers, but also in the provision of worker training. This potentially important dimension of skill upgrading has largely escaped the attention of other studies in this literature.====Secondly, our paper contributes to an active literature that tries to not only identify the causal effect of foreign ownership on firm performance but also pinpoint why exactly foreign-acquired firms are often found to perform better than firms remaining in domestic ownership. An important example is Guadalupe et al. (2012), who use the same Spanish firm-level data as we do and who emphasize the market size effect of foreign ownership in boosting innovation and productivity following acquisition.==== We contribute to this literature by focusing on (different forms of) skill upgrading within firms, and by emphasizing interactions between technology and skills that have not received much attention in the literature, but which we show to be crucial for understanding post-acquisition performance. The empirical evidence we present, along with the theoretical model we propose, demonstrates that the productivity gains within foreign-acquired firms derive from combining new and superior technology with suitably trained workers as well as a higher skill intensity in production. This is in sharp contrast to Guadalupe et al. (2012), who attribute all changes in post-acquisition performance to changes in technology.====Finally, by providing evidence on the relationship among foreign ownership, technology, and skills, our paper contributes to the influential and extensive literature on skill-biased technological change. Excellent reviews of this literature can be found in Acemoglu (2003), Bond and Van Reenen (2007), and Goldin and Katz (2007). One potential limitation in this literature is that skill-biased technological change is difficult to observe directly, and so the evidence usually derives from aggregate data, i.e., industry- or country-level data. This ignores substantial within-industry variation across firms as well as endogeneity in technology and skill choices at the firm level (seen Bøler, 2015). More recent studies use exogenous variation in the availability of new technology—e.g. broadband internet as in Akerman et al. (2015)—to test whether and to what extent technological change is skill biased. By exploiting within-firm variation in technology and skills triggered by changes in ownership structure from domestic to foreign, we provide a novel and tangible piece of evidence, at the firm level, that supports the notion that technological progress is skill biased.====The remainder of our paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we describe our data-set and the sample we use. In Section 3 we present our empirical analysis and the main findings. In Section 4 we develop a simple model of foreign ownership that can rationalize our empirical findings.

As a number of countries have been grappling with constraints on monetary policy, a burgeoning literature is reopening debates about optimal currency regimes. There are arguments that, if the deflationary pressures pushing the economy in a liquidity trap originate at home, then the domestic policymaker benefits from the external nominal anchor provided by a currency peg (Cook and Devereux, 2016). By contrast, such an anchor would be welfare reducing if the deflationary shocks were global (Corsetti et al., 2017). We contribute to this recent debate by studying the sustainability of an optimal currency regime and, in particular, the relationship between sustainability and the policymaker's preferences.====Currency-crisis models have shown that even an optimal peg may not survive because of time inconsistency issues à la Barro and Gordon (1983).==== Moreover, these models imply that a peg is unambiguously more stable under a more “conservative” central bank, i.e. a bank that is more averse to inflation/devaluation. This result – by now, a conventional wisdom – arises as the flip side of a negative relationship between central bank conservatism and the size of the attendant time inconsistency issues.====In this paper, we revisit this conventional wisdom, and show that it does not always apply. We start from the following two observations. First, the stronger the time-inconsistency issues, the greater the benefit of committing credibly to a peg by, say, joining a currency union. This echoes a view of the European Monetary System (EMS) – a system of currency pegs – as a commitment mechanism for providing a nominal anchor to discipline policymakers (Giavazzi and Pagano, 1988). Second, in order to reap the benefits of a currency union in the long run, a central bank would need to first demonstrate its dedication to exchange rate stability by, for instance, pegging in the short run. This is consistent with the Maastricht convergence criteria for joining the EMU.==== These two observations together suggest that the worse time-inconsistency issues of a ==== conservative central bank would ==== the perceived value of a currency peg. It is this implication that may reverse the above conventional wisdom.",When pegging is a commitment device: Revisiting conventional wisdom about currency crises,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300157,May 2019,2019,Research Article,254.0

Data on domestic and foreign acquisitions in emerging markets over the period 1990–2007 support the model predictions. The share of full foreign acquisitions is higher in sectors more reliant on external finance, in countries with lower financial development, and in countries with higher institutional quality. Sectoral external finance dependence accentuates the effect of country-level financial development and institutional quality. By contrast, the level of foreign ownership in partial acquisitions is insensitive to institutional factors and depends weakly on financial factors.","Since the early 2000s, there has been a rapid increase in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and a significant share of those transactions involve purchases of firms in the developing world with most of the capital originating in developed countries (UNCTAD, 2016). Such acquisitions entail both benefits and costs for foreign acquirers based in developed countries. On the one hand, the relative scarcity of capital due to low financial development depresses the internal valuations of target firms, making the targets attractive to foreign acquirers seeking higher returns.==== On the other hand, operating firms in those markets involves sourcing local inputs in an unfamiliar environment with weaker institutions, less secure property rights, and more distortionary policies, all of which potentially raise the cost of operation. We henceforth refer to costs faced by foreign owners when trying to operate fully owned firms, i.e., without domestic co-ownership, in such an environment as “weak institutions” (North, 1991) for conciseness. We show that the choice of ownership structure in cross-border M&A is critical in balancing these benefits and costs, and represents an endogenous response of multinational corporations to the particular operating environment they face in developing countries.====We first document a set of facts about foreign ownership of firms in emerging market economies (EMEs). Existing research has established that the extent of foreign control in FDI is an important determinant of technology transfer, labor productivity, wages, export participation, as well as the nature and extent of spillovers to local firms. Our study examines the factors that determine the extent of control. We develop a model that clarifies how the competing economic forces – the provision of capital versus the mitigation of the costs associated with weaker institutions – jointly determine the optimal degree of foreign ownership and the relative volumes of brownfield FDI investment across different countries and sectors. We find evidence that financial, institutional and technological factors all play a role in the choice between full and partial acquisitions, as well as the ownership structure in partial acquisitions.====To highlight the trade-offs facing a foreign acquirer, our model postulates that production in the emerging market requires capital and a local input. The foreign acquirer solves for an optimal ownership contract between itself and the domestic target firm that captures its advantage in having greater access to capital markets relative to the credit-constrained target, and the potential disadvantages of operating a firm in an emerging market. The foreign owner is at a disadvantage over local firms in that it faces additional costs due to weaker institutions. We model this as a markup on local inputs paid only by the foreign firm, making local production more expensive and reducing profits. The markup also adds an incentive for operating the firm with a local co-owner. Thus, the prospective foreign acquirer faces a choice between obtaining full control of the credit-constrained target, in which case it is compelled to pay a higher price for the local input, or to take partial ownership, in which case the domestic partner can provide the local input at the lower price.====Three sets of predictions emerge from the model. The first and second pertain to the ownership structure chosen by the foreign acquirer, conditional on entry. Full foreign acquisitions (relative to minority foreign ownership) of emerging market targets are more likely in sectors that have a greater dependence on external finance, and in countries that are less financially developed: At the margin, the differential payoff to the foreign firm from a full versus a partial acquisition rises with the severity of the target's credit constraint. A lower markup on the local input in the model, i.e., better institutions, tilts the ownership structure towards full foreign ownership by increasing the marginal payoff from a full acquisition. The effects of the local input price markup and financial development are also predicted to be the largest for the sectors of the economy most dependent on external finance.====The second set of predictions pertains to partial acquisitions (conditional on entry) and the local input is therefore provided by the emerging market partner. Here a trade-off arises between acquiring greater ownership and leaving the domestic owner with enough equity to motivate the optimal provision of the local input. The size of a foreign stake in a partial acquisition is larger in industries that are more dependent on external finance and in less financially developed countries, but this dependence is tempered by technological factors. Because the importance of the local input varies across industries, the optimal equity share that motivates the domestic owner to provide it optimally also varies. In industries where the domestic equity share in profits is high enough to exceed the stand-alone value of the firm (the domestic owner's outside option), the share is governed by technological factors rather than either of the two financial factors. This effect weakens the influence of finance in determining the precise size of partial stakes. At the same time, because all partial acquisitions involve local input provision by the domestic agent, the input price markup is predicted not to influence the ownership structure in partial acquisitions.====Our final predictions relate to the overall likelihood of foreign acquisitions across different countries and sectors. Foreign acquisitions are predicted to be more likely in sectors that have a greater dependence on external finance, in countries where financial markets are less developed, and when the markup paid by foreign firms for the local input is lower (i.e., when institutions are better). Lack of access to finance lowers the value of the target to the domestic owner, while a low markup on the local input increases its value for the foreign firm. Both factors thus increase profits to the foreign owner and therefore make foreign acquisition more likely.====We test these predictions in a panel of cross-border M&A transactions by developed market firms in fourteen emerging markets over the 1990–2007 period. We use the Rajan and Zingales (1998) measure of external finance dependence and commonly used proxies for financial development as our main financial indicators. We use anti-corruption indices as our baseline measure of institutional quality to capture the comparative disadvantage that foreigners face in obtaining the local input on their own without help from a domestic co-owner.==== The regression evidence confirms the main predictions of the model. There is a positive relationship between the probability of a full foreign acquisition and dependence on external finance of a target, financial underdevelopment, and measures of institutional quality. External finance dependence is found to accentuate the latter two effects, also consistent with the model. Second, we examine the relationship between ownership structures in the subset of partial acquisitions and financial development, institutional quality, and the target's dependence on external finance. Consistent with the model, we find that institutional quality plays no role in ownership structure choice in partial foreign acquisitions, and uncover a weak positive relationship between the average sizes of minority foreign acquisitions and our financial indicators. Finally, we also find strong evidence consistent with the predictions of the model regarding the variation across sectors and countries in the overall probability of foreign acquisitions.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We review existing research and relate it to our work in the next subsection. In Section 2 we describe some prominent features of cross-border acquisitions in the manufacturing sector of emerging markets. We then describe our theoretical model and establish some empirical hypotheses in Section 3. Section 4 reports our main empirical results while Section 5 provides robustness checks and some additional results.

A recent empirical literature (e.g., Autor et al., 2013) has produced convincing evidence suggesting that trade with poor (skilled-labor scarce) countries affects workers in rich countries in a sizable way. In general, these effects exacerbate differences between skilled and unskilled workers in many dimensions, such as wages, and unemployment (Autor et al., 2014; Hummels et al., 2014). This paper deepens our understanding of the specific channels through which international trade contributes to changes in the relative demand for skilled workers in industrialized countries.====In particular, we focus on how the offshoring of intermediate inputs by French manufacturing firms affects the employment of skilled workers relative to unskilled workers in their French plants. We uncover the following set of novel empirical facts: (i) Low-productivity firms obtain their inputs domestically and display little variation in their domestic skill intensity in comparison with offshoring firms. (ii) Medium-productivity firms offshore the production of skill-intensive inputs to skill-abundant locations and are more labor intensive than low–productivity firms in their domestic production. (iii) High-productivity firms additionally import labor-intensive inputs from labor-abundant locations and are more skill intensive than non-importers. Moreover, the surge in imports from labor-abundant countries that took place between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s has been accompanied by a sizable increase in the domestic skill intensity of French firms that import from these locations. The skill intensity of firms importing from skill-abundant countries has instead remained constant over this period.====Our empirical analysis is guided by a simple model featuring heterogeneous firms (Melitz, 2003) and trade in intermediate inputs. The latter differ in their relative factor intensities and source countries have relative factor prices inversely related to their factor abundance. Firms are heterogeneous in terms of productivity, and offshoring of intermediates requires the payment of per-input fixed offshoring costs. Firms must therefore weigh the reduction in their marginal costs resulting from offshoring, say, a labor-intensive input to a labor-abundant country against the fixed costs implied by such a decision. Higher firm-level productivity implies that a given cost reduction from offshoring yields larger gains in variable profits.====The model produces predictions consistent with the above mentioned patterns. From the perspective of a relatively skill-abundant country like France, low-productivity firms produce all inputs domestically, as their small size does not enable them to cover the fixed costs for offshoring intermediates. Sufficiently productive firms offshore the most skill-intensive inputs to skill-abundant locations and labor-intensive inputs to labor-abundant locations. However, if offshoring costs are larger for labor-abundant locations, the productivity threshold for importing from these locations will be larger than the one for sourcing from skill-abundant locations. Imports from skill-abundant countries substitute for domestic skilled workers and thus reduce the domestic skill intensity of importers relative to that of non-importers. Symmetrically, imports from labor-abundant countries substitute for domestic unskilled employment, making domestic production more skill intensive. Thus, selection into offshoring generates endogenous within-industry variation in skill intensities. Reductions in trade barriers vis-à-vis labor-abundant countries lead existing importers from these countries to source additional labor-intensive inputs and induce more firms to offshore to these countries. The domestic skill intensity of these firms will rise in comparison to that of firms not sourcing from labor-abundant countries.====Our focus on firms' importing decisions generates a number of additional testable predictions on their sourcing patterns. This allows us to gauge the microeconomic channels that determine firms' domestic relative factor-input choices. ====To test the empirical predictions of our model we use a quasi-exhaustive panel dataset of French manufacturing firms for the period 1996–2007. These data provide information on firm-level imports by product and origin country, and have been extensively used in the literature due to their high quality (e.g. Berman, Martin, Mayer, 2012 and Mayer, Melitz, Ottaviano, 2014). We first confirm that prediction (i) on firms' sourcing patterns holds in the data. We then establish the link between firms' imports and their domestic skill intensity, as stated in (ii). We exploit supply shocks in France's trading partners to provide causal evidence that the surge in imports from labor-abundant countries has led to a substantial increase in French manufacturing firms' skill intensity over the sample period. In fact, we find that most of the observed within-firm changes in skill intensity can be explained by increased offshoring to labor-abundant countries. Importers from labor-abundant countries raised their average domestic skill intensity by 10%. Our IV estimates imply that this number can be exclusively explained by increased offshoring to labor-abundant countries.====Our work has a clear connection to the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model. Traditional approaches here, based on the factor content of trade, have provided only limited empirical support (see, e.g., Bowen et al., 1987; Trefler, 1995). By contrast, a more recent set of tests, based on disaggregate product level data, are highly supportive of factor proportions shaping countries' trade patterns (Romalis, 2004; Schott, 2004; Nunn, 2007). Our empirical evidence reinforces the latter approach by showing that the large within-industry variation in factor intensity we find in the data calls for using disaggregate product-level trade data when testing the HO mechanism.====The paper also contributes to the recent literature on offshoring. In particular, our model is inspired by Feenstra and Hanson (1997), where firms offshore some of their labor-intensive activities in response to liberalization of capital markets, thereby reducing the demand for unskilled labor in the U.S. We extend their work by introducing firm heterogeneity, which enables us to derive and test implications at the firm level. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) present an offshoring model with complementarities between domestically performed and offshored tasks where reductions in offshoring costs for unskilled tasks may benefit unskilled workers if complementarities are sufficiently strong to overturn standard HO forces. Instead, our theory focuses on sourcing patterns and their implications for domestic firm-level skill intensities, for which we find strong empirical support: domestic skill intensities increase with imports from labor-abundant countries and decrease with imports from skill-abundant locations.==== In this regard, our work is also related to Yeaple (2003), who demonstrates that the structure of U.S. FDI reflects an interaction between country skilled-labor abundance and industry skilled-labor intensities that is consistent with comparative advantage.====There are several alternative explanations for the link between trade and the relative demand for skills that are consistent with two key features of the data: within-industry variation in skill intensity and a positive correlation between skill intensity and productivity. However, all of them focus on the connection between exporting and domestic skill intensity.==== We emphasize the role of importing for skill upgrading and – while also controlling for the export channel in our empirical specifications – provide specific evidence for the corresponding theoretical mechanism. Specifically, we show that firms' sourcing patterns are in line with our model and that offshoring to labor-abundant countries increases domestic skill intensity, while offshoring to skill-abundant countries is associated with a decrease in this variable.====Finally, we also contribute to the empirical literature on importing and domestic factor demand using firm-level data. Hummels et al. (2014), for example, employ data on Danish importers and provide evidence that the wages of high-skilled workers are positively affected by offshoring. In contrast to this literature, which is purely empirical, we investigate the specific theoretical mechanisms through which skill demand at the firm level is affected by offshoring. Moreover, we show that the impact on the relative factor demand of firms depends on the factor abundance of the sourcing location.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we set up our theoretical model and derive predictions on sourcing patterns and domestic skill intensity; Section 3 describes the data; Sections 4 and 5 report our empirical results; finally we present our conclusions in Section 6.",Offshoring and skill-upgrading in French manufacturing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300029,May 2019,2019,Research Article,256.0

Firm size plays a critical role in the relationship between leverage, firm fragility and exchange rate movements in emerging markets. While the relationship between firm-leverage and distress scores varies over time, the relationship between firm size and corporate vulnerability is relatively time-invariant. All else equal, large firms in emerging markets are more financially vulnerable and also systemically important. Consistent with the granular origins of aggregate fluctuations in ====, idiosyncratic shocks to the sales growth of large firms are positively and significantly correlated with GDP growth in our emerging markets sample. Relatedly, the negative impact of exchange rate shocks has a more acute impact on the sales growth of the more highly levered large firms.","There was a rapid credit expansion in emerging-market countries in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). A surge in foreign borrowing and deterioration in net external debt positions accompanied the increase in domestic credit (BIS, 2014; IMF, 2015). The non-financial corporate sector accounts for the lion's share of this surge in leverage including significant increases in international bond issuance (Fig. 1). The total domestic and foreign debt of emerging market-based non-financial firms rose from $2.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion, and outstanding international bonds grew from $360 billion to $1.1 trillion between 2007 and 2015 (BIS, 2016).====Monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, rising emerging-market sovereign debt premia, low corporate profitability and market valuations all together have the potential to cause severe liquidity problems for emerging market firms.==== In fact, following taper talk and the lift-off from the zero lower bound in the United States, tight dollar funding conditions have led to sharp reversals in capital flows to emerging markets.==== Rising fears, notably Turkey, are that normalizing monetary policy conditions in the US could trigger waves of corporate failures in a number of emerging economies. Understanding the potential vulnerabilities, however, requires that we know more about the state of emerging market corporate balance sheets and their hitherto unexplored impact on the macroeconomy. Our paper aims to do so.====The paper's main contribution is to investigate the role of large firms in the emerging market economies and whether their vulnerabilities portend adverse macroeconomic consequences. Gabaix (2011) notes that the largest firms dominate economic activity in advanced countries and shocks to the largest firms can affect aggregate output as these shocks do not get diversified in the aggregate data.====We start by showing that firm size plays a critical role in the relationship between leverage, firm fragility and exchange rate movements in emerging markets. We also show that while the relationship between leverage and distress scores varies over time, the relationship between firm size and corporate vulnerability is relatively time-invariant. To our knowledge this result is new. Next, we carefully examine whether the most leveraged and financially fragile firms in emerging markets are also the most systemically important. We believe that this is the first paper to formally test Gabaix's (2011) granular origins of aggregate fluctuations hypothesis using emerging market data. The details of the analysis follow below.====We use detailed financial statement information from Worldscope and Orbis for a broad cross-section of emerging markets over a twenty-year period to study the relationship between firm characteristics such as size, leverage and corporate financial fragility over time. As a summary measure of corporate fragility, we use the widely used Altman's ====-score measure adapted to the emerging market context (Altman, 2005).====We begin by documenting the cross-country patterns in the Altman's Z-score for the emerging markets in our sample. Next, using detailed firm-level information, we investigate the relationship between leverage and corporate financial fragility with particular emphasis on the role of firm size. We also examine the impact of macroeconomic and institutional factors such as exchange rates, economic growth, and financial globalization interacted with leverage on corporate distress scores.====We find that in the post-GFC period, many countries have higher leverage and are close to or in the Altman ====-score “grey zone” implying a higher risk of financial distress. Turkey now in distress territory is perhaps a good example. Regression estimates show that leverage has a negative correlation with the Z score, i.e., scores for firms with high leverage are closer to the distressed range. Further, large firms and highly levered firms are more financially vulnerable. Interestingly, the magnitude of the coefficient on firm size almost quadruples with the introduction of country-year fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity across countries and is eight times larger with firm-fixed effects. Moreover, across alternative definitions of firm size, the relationship with financial vulnerability remains negative and highly statistically significant. Large firms, therefore, appear to be a principal source of corporate financial vulnerability in emerging markets.====We also find that while the relationship between leverage and fragility varies over time, the firm characteristic that is consistently significant and robust is firm size. To explain the observed country-year heterogeneity we conjecture is that if firms borrow in foreign currency, leverage will likely have a particularly adverse impact on corporate financial fragility in times of currency depreciation. The data suggest that indeed the interaction effect between leverage and currency depreciation is negative and statistically significant. The inclusion of country-year fixed effects rules out any concern of direct reverse causality, i.e., the possibility that an increase in firm fragility leads to currency depreciation.====We undertake a number of tests and explore alternative explanations to ensure the robustness of our results. The relationship between firm size and financial fragility is robust to economic recessions and tighter financial conditions. Also, the effect of firm size and leverage conditional on changes in the bilateral exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar are robust to leverage interactions with inflation, financial development, and the updated Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) index of financial globalization. Importantly, the size variable remains negative, highly statistically significant with a remarkably stable coefficient magnitude across all the specifications.====Additional tests reveal that the relationship between firm size and corporate financial fragility is robust to the survivorship bias of firms, excluding China from the specifications and the use of a constant sample. We also find a differential interaction effect of leverage and exchange rate changes on corporate financial fragility that depends on whether emerging market currencies are strengthening or weakening the interaction effect of leverage and change in the exchange rate on ====-scores conditional on currency depreciation is negative and statistically significant. Concerning sector-specificity, the estimations show a larger and statistically significant interaction effect between leverage and exchange rates for non-tradable industries and a smaller and insignificant coefficient for the tradable sector.====A potential concern is that for variables measured with error, our results may suffer from attenuation bias that is amplified by the presence of firm and country-year fixed effects. To address attenuation bias, as well as other remaining endogeneity concerns, we use two instruments for the exchange rate. One based on world capital flows data (Bussière et al., 2015, and Alfaro et al., 2018) interacted with the time-varying country-specific values of the Chinn-Ito index for financial openness and a second instrument that uses currency weights computed by Bénétrix et al. (2015) to build an exogenous shock to the financially weighted exchange rate. The instrumental variables specifications confirm that the interaction effect between leverage and the exchange rate and firm size on corporate distress scores is negative and statistically significant. Importantly, the coefficient magnitudes in the instrumental variable regressions are much larger alleviating concerns about attenuation bias.====Next, we turn to the second main contribution of the paper. A fundamental question is whether the findings about firm size and leverage documented above can have adverse macroeconomic consequences especially with monetary policy normalization in advanced economies. To answer this question, we explore the role of large firms and their importance for the overall economic performance in emerging markets. Consistent with Gabaix (2011) we find that large firms are systemically important—idiosyncratic shocks to large firms significantly correlate with GDP growth in our sample of emerging markets. We see that while large firms are less levered than small firms, they may have a more risky type of leverage as large firm performance in terms of sales growth deteriorates more significantly in response to exchange rate depreciation. While this result holds for the average country in our sample, we also find that there is substantial cross-country heterogeneity. In conjunction with the contributions that large firms make to the overall economic performance in emerging markets, the leverage vulnerabilities of these firms may, therefore, warrant particular attention from policymakers.====Note again that there is considerable concern about the recent increase in dollar borrowing by emerging market firms (McCauley et al. 2015, Avdjiev et al., 2014, and Acharya et al., 2015). Our paper is the first to provide evidence of the macroeconomic consequences of the links between leverage, currency movements, and firm size. Given that disaggregate data on the liability composition (currency, maturity, type of lender) of non-financial firms are not available our tests are a valuable and novel contribution to the literature. Implicitly, there is an intimate link between the vulnerabilities of systemically large firms, bailout guarantees, and moral hazard issues in emerging market lending where widespread corporate debt vulnerabilities can turn into full-blown financial crises. Once again, Turkey is a case in point.====Our paper is related to several strands of literature. First, the paper contributes to the literature on the recent evolution of corporate debt in the aftermath of the GFC. IMF (2015) documents the main trends and shows that global factors drive the increase in corporate leverage following the GFC. This finding is in line with Shin's (2013) view that the response to the crisis led to a sudden increase in global liquidity. Acharya et al. (2015) present several case studies and evaluate vulnerabilities and potential policy responses. More generally, this paper relates to the literature documenting the association between rapid credit growth and the building of corporate leverage and financial crises (Mendoza and Terrones, 2008, and Schularick and Taylor, 2012). The paper is also related to the literature on the origins of the Asian Financial Crisis also credited with corporate financial roots.==== Our paper is also related to the growing literature on the financial channel of exchange rate changes (Bruno and Shin, 2015a).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the firm-level data. Section 3 provides detailed stylized facts about leverage and corporate vulnerabilities in emerging markets including the build-up of corporate debt and our methodology for measuring corporate financial fragility.

Steinberg Joseph B.,"University of Toronto, Department of Economics, 150 St. George Street, Toronto M5S 3G7, Canada","Received 18 August 2017, Revised 23 January 2019, Accepted 25 January 2019, Available online 30 January 2019, Version of Record 14 February 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2019.01.009,Cited by (96),"On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. The ","The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union on June 23, 2016, but the law that authorized this referendum was silent about the trade policies that would replace E.U. membership. The Brexit vote was followed by widespread speculation that uncertainty about future U.K.-E.U. trade policies would cause immediate harm to the U.K. economy, although recent national income accounting and trade data suggest that this harm has not materialized. In this paper, I analyze the effects of Brexit on U.K. macroeconomic dynamics and quantify the cost of Brexit uncertainty.====I use a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model of the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the rest of the world to address two quantitative questions about the consequences of Brexit. First, how will departure from the European Union affect the U.K. economy in the short and long run? Second, how will uncertainty about the trade policies that will replace E.U. membership in the future affect the U.K. economy in the present?====The model features three countries, an input-output production structure, heterogeneous firms, and, most importantly, uncertainty about trade costs. Firms make forward-looking decisions about export participation, creating a scope for trade policy uncertainty to affect macroeconomic dynamics and trade flows. The model incorporates a theory of export participation dynamics developed in recent work by Steinberg (2019) which features both an extensive margin, as in Melitz (2003) and Chaney (2008), as well as an intensive margin, as in Arkolakis (2010). Firms choose whether to export to a foreign market, and if so, they gradually build their customer bases in that market over time by advertising. Uncertainty can also affect households' decisions about saving and investment. To compute the model's equilibrium I use a novel global method that provides an exact solution, allowing for an accurate analysis of welfare and the effects of uncertainty.====In my quantitative analysis, I calibrate the model's parameters so that its steady state matches an input-output matrix from 2011, when the possibility of Brexit had not yet entered the global consciousness, as well as a set of facts about export participation that I have computed using two sources of microdata. To assess the overall impact of Brexit, I compare this no-Brexit steady state to an equilibrium in which trade costs follow a stochastic process that captures uncertainty about the outcome of the Brexit referendum and about post-Brexit changes in trade policy. To assess the impact of this uncertainty, I compare the stochastic equilibrium to a set of deterministic equilibria in which model agents have perfect foresight about these events. I find that overall welfare losses from Brexit will be substantial. Consumption-equivalent welfare losses are between 0.4 and 1.2% depending on how much post-Brexit trade costs rise. The welfare cost of uncertainty about Brexit is small, however, accounting for less than a quarter of a percent of the overall welfare cost.====In order to assess the impact of Brexit I must specify the set of possible trade policies that could replace E.U. membership in my model. Following Dhingra et al., 2016c, Dhingra et al., 2016b, I take a parsimonious approach with two possible scenarios. If soft Brexit occurs, the United Kingdom retains tariff-free trade with the European single market through either continued membership in the European Economic Area or bilateral negotiation.==== If, on the other hand, hard Brexit occurs, the United Kingdom loses single-market access and trades with the European Union according to World Trade Organization rules. In addition to formal tariffs, I incorporate non-tariff trade barriers which I model as iceberg transportation costs. The literature on trade costs has found that non-tariff barriers are often larger than tariffs (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2004; Allen, 2014; Lim, 2018), particularly in the services sector where tariffs are essentially nonexistent. One of the major concerns about Brexit, in fact, centers around whether or not financial services firms will retain passporting rights that enable them to operate in the European Union. I use the estimates of Francois et al. (2013) for non-tariff barriers in E.U. trade with the United States as an upper bound for post-Brexit non-tariff barriers in E.U. trade with the United Kingdom.====In order to analyze the effects of uncertainty about Brexit, I must also model the timing of the Brexit process and the likelihood of each scenario. The first real indication that Brexit might be a possibility arose in January of 2013, when Prime Minister David Cameron promised that he would hold a referendum on European Union membership if his Conservative party was reelected in May of 2015. The Conservatives won reelection and the European Union Referendum Act 2015, which authorized a popular vote on E.U. membership, was introduced to the House of Commons shortly thereafter. The bill passed the House of Commons the next month and was approved by the House of Lords in December of 2015. The referendum date was formally announced in February of 2016, and the vote itself took place in June of 2016. Since then, the British government has converged on a March 2019 target for completion of negotiations with the European Union about post-Brexit policies. I capture this timeline in my model as follows. The economy begins in the no-Brexit steady state in which agents believe trade costs with the European Union will remain at their 2011 levels forever. In 2015 there is an unanticipated shock that initiates a stochastic process for trade costs with the European Union. This process, depicted in Fig. 2, involves two uncertain events. The first is the Brexit referendum which occurs in 2016, one year after the unanticipated shock. If the referendum fails, trade costs stay at 2011 levels forever. If the referendum passes, Brexit will occur in 2019 but model agents do not learn which Brexit scenario they will face until this time. After the unanticipated shock in 2015, agents have rational expectations about this process. I set the probability that the referendum fails to 75% based on prediction market data, and I set the probability of soft Brexit conditional on the referendum's success to 50%. None of my results are sensitive to these transition probabilities, however.====In the long run, Brexit will have a large impact on the U.K. macroeconomy. Depending on which scenario occurs, real GDP will fall by 0.5–1.4%, consumption will fall by 0.5–1.3%, and trade flows with the remainder of the European Union will fall by 8.2–44.8%. In the short run, most macroeconomic variables remain close to their no-Brexit steady state values until Brexit occurs in 2019; the announcement of the referendum and the outcome of the vote have little impact on U.K. macroeconomic dynamics. This prediction is consistent with the recent national income accounting and trade data shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. Once Brexit occurs, though, export participation, trade flows, and macroeconomic variables begin to decline towards their long-run levels. I measure the welfare losses from Brexit using a backward-looking method which conditions on whether Brexit is hard or soft. This method asks U.K. households in each scenario what fraction of their annual consumption they would give up to have remained in the no-Brexit steady state instead. I find consumption-equivalent welfare losses of 0.4% and 1.2% for soft and hard Brexit, respectively. The present values of these figures are equivalent to about £7000 and £19,000 per person.====In the short run, uncertainty about Brexit will have little impact on U.K. macroeconomic dynamics and welfare. I demonstrate this by comparing the stochastic baseline equilibrium described in Fig. 2 with two perfect-foresight equilibria, one for each possible Brexit scenario, in which households learn immediately after the referendum announcement in 2015 which scenario will occur. In both the long and short run, macroeconomic dynamics and trade flows in the stochastic baseline are virtually identical to their perfect-foresight counterparts. The consumption-equivalent welfare differences between the baseline equilibrium and the perfect-foresight equilibria are on the order of 1/1000 of a percent, indicating that uncertainty accounts for about a quarter of a percent of the overall welfare losses from Brexit. The present value of the welfare loss from Brexit uncertainty is less than £50 per person.====I have conducted a wide variety of sensitivity analyses and have found that all of my results are robust. I have analyzed a variety of other theories of export participation dynamics, I have studied a number of alternative Brexit scenarios, and I have experimented with different assumptions about financial markets, sectoral aggregation, and assigned parameter values. None of these sensitivity analyses change my results significantly. In particular, the welfare cost of uncertainty about Brexit is small in all versions of my quantitative analysis.====This paper contributes to several strands of the international trade and macroeconomics literatures. First, it contributes to the literature on the economic consequences of Brexit. A number of recent studies use static models and reduced-form estimations to analyze the impact of Brexit, from increased trade costs and other factors, on U.K. welfare and trade with the European Union (Dhingra et al., 2016c, Dhingra et al., 2016b; Ebell et al., 2016; Baker et al., 2016). My paper is the first to use a dynamic general equilibrium model to assess the impact of Brexit on the U.K. economy in both the short and long run, and the first to quantify the cost of short-run uncertainty about Brexit. My study is limited, though, to the economic impact of increased post-Brexit trade costs. The United Kingdom stands to benefit from reduced fiscal transfers to the European Union after Brexit, and changes in immigration policy may also affect U.K. households' welfare. Further, leaving the European Union could lower U.K. productivity due to reduced foreign direct investment (Dhingra et al., 2016a; Pain and Young, 2004; McGrattan and Waddle, 2017). The Brexit literature, is of course, part of a larger body of recent research on the macroeconomic consequences of protectionism. Ruhl (2014) and Barattieri et al. (2018), for example, analyze the aggregate impact of antidumping investigations and other forms of temporary trade barriers, and Steinberg (2018b) studies how terminating NAFTA would affect the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican economies.====More broadly, several recent studies analyze the welfare impact of trade reforms in models with capital accumulation and other dynamic adjustment margins at the macro level (Baldwin, 1992; Bajona and Kehoe, 2010; Dix-Carneiro, 2014; Alessandria et al., 2018; Brooks and Pujolas, 2018). My model features both physical investment and intertemporal trade. My results indicate, though, that these features play minor roles in determining U.K. welfare losses from Brexit. My paper also contributes to the related literature on trade dynamics with heterogeneous firms and endogenous export participation (Alessandria and Choi, 2007; Ruhl, 2008; Alessandria et al., 2013, Alessandria et al., 2018; Alessandria et al., 2017; Alessandria and Choi, 2018; Ramanarayanan, 2017). My model builds on these studies by incorporating a novel theory of export participation dynamics (Steinberg, 2019) into a quantitative, general equilibrium model. The theory incorporates features from both the new exporter dynamics literature, which emphasizes sunk costs of starting to export (Das et al., 2007; Ruhl and Willis, 2017; Alessandria et al., 2018), and the literature on market penetration and the least-traded-products margin (Arkolakis, 2010; Kehoe and Ruhl, 2013; Kehoe et al., 2015).====Finally, my paper contributes to the emerging literature on trade policy uncertainty. In contrast to my finding that the effects of uncertainty about Brexit are small, several studies in this literature have found large effects in other contexts. Pierce and Schott (2016) and Handley and Limão (2017), for example, argue that before China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, uncertainty about U.S. trade policy towards Chinese goods significantly affected U.S. imports from China and lowered U.S. households' welfare. My analysis, which indicates that uncertainty about Brexit has little macroeconomic impact, highlights the need for further quantitative research in this area. Trade policy uncertainty in North America, Asia, and other regions outside of Europe caused by the recent global resurgence of protectionism further highlights the importance of this line of inquiry.",Brexit and the macroeconomic impact of trade policy uncertainty,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300121,March 2019,2019,Research Article,258.0

In line with the canonical trade in tasks model, the employment gains are greater in firms with higher initial levels of service offshoring.","There is a widespread fear in the developed world that domestic jobs are endangered by offshoring to low-wage countries. A popular narrative suggests that these anxieties played a decisive role in the US presidential elections of 2016.==== More generally, the increasing public concern about offshoring is evidenced by the rising media attention to this topic over time, as documented for the UK and the US by Amiti and Wei (2005) and Mankiw and Swagel (2006), and more recently discussed by Hummels et al. (2016). In Germany, offshoring has been found to increase job loss fears, particularly among high-skilled workers (Geishecker et al., 2012). These workers may indeed be threatened by a ‘new wave’ of offshoring in services (Bardhan and Kroll, 2003) that has been triggered by groundbreaking innovations in information and communication technologies (ICT) over the past decades. The spread of portable computers, broadband internet, and the smartphone has made services tradable globally that could only be provided locally before. As a consequence, the share of service trade in world GDP has doubled from around 3% to 6% between 1985 and 2016.==== Since jobs in the newly tradable commercial services are typically skill-intensive and high-paying (Jensen, 2008), the question arises: Are these ‘good’ domestic jobs lost due to service offshoring?====In theory, the employment effects of offshoring are not as clear-cut as one might expect. While the relocation itself obviously reduces domestic employment, the associated cost savings entail a productivity effect that can help offshoring firms to expand their output, which ameliorates the job losses and might even turn them into job creation. The seminal ‘trade in tasks’ model by Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008), formalizing these ideas, has typically been applied to offshoring of manufactured inputs, but similar effects can be expected for services.==== The ambiguous theoretical predictions call for an empirical investigation into the employment effects of service offshoring.====The lack of appropriate micro data on service offshoring firms has severely restricted empirical investigations in the past, as establishing causality is difficult at the industry level. Only recently, firm-level data on service trade have become available and opened the door to a more rigorous causal analysis. Such a firm-level analysis can build on recent extensions of the trade in tasks model that show how the relocation and productivity effects of offshoring vary across heterogeneous firms.==== However, the same models also predict that larger and more productive firms are more active in offshoring, raising an important endogeneity issue that needs to be addressed empirically.====This paper's goal is to estimate the causal effects of service offshoring on firm employment in Germany, the world's second largest importer of services. Service offshoring is measured by imports of tradable commercial services, reflecting the fact that the relocation of a required service to another country necessarily entails subsequent imports of this service. The paper builds on an exceptionally detailed panel dataset, covering almost the entire universe of German firms' service imports by partner countries and service types over the period from 2001 to 2013. These data are newly combined with firm-level employment and balance sheet information for the purpose of this analysis. The resulting firm panel provides an almost comprehensive picture of German service offshoring.====I use these micro data to investigate the firm-level employment effects of both changes in the volume of offshoring (the intensive margin) and new offshoring (the extensive margin). The main analysis at the intensive margin instruments for service offshoring using firm-specific export supply shocks by partner countries and service types in fixed effects regressions. This instrumental variable (IV) strategy follows Hummels et al. (2014), who use it to analyze offshoring of manufactured inputs by Danish firms. The IV exploits the fact that firms' importing behavior is highly firm-specific and stable over time. Holding the initial import mix of a firm constant, the time variation in its partner countries' exports to the rest of the world by service types is used as a revealed measure of changes in these countries' comparative advantage. The rationale behind this approach is that a German firm, which initially imports a given service from a given country, benefits disproportionately from an improvement in the country's comparative advantage in this particular service, and can thus expand its offshoring activities. The crucial assumption of the IV approach is that foreign exports to the rest of the world are uncorrelated with the German firm's employment growth, except through offshoring (conditional on the control variables, which include industry-year fixed effects). Under this exclusion restriction, it serves to identify the causal effect of service offshoring on firm employment.====The main finding of this paper is that service offshoring has ==== domestic employment in German firms. The estimated elasticity of 6.0–7.6% suggests that this effect is economically sizable, and the IV approach ensures that the positive effect is not driven by simultaneity or omitted variables. Instead, the two-stage least squares estimates can be interpreted as evidence for a cost savings effect from offshoring, which allows firms to expand and hire more workers. In line with this interpretation, service offshoring is found to boost firm output, labor productivity, and the use of other inputs. Moreover, the employment gains are greater in firms with higher initial levels of service offshoring. These patterns are fully in line with the functioning of the productivity effect in Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) and can be rationalized by recent offshoring models featuring firm heterogeneity (see Antràs et al., 2017; Egger et al., 2016). Intuitively, if foreign services become cheaper, the firm experiences cost savings that tend to raise its output and can increase the use of domestic inputs, including employment. However, these cost savings are approximately zero for the first offshored worker, as they work only through the infra-marginal tasks, which have previously been offshored. Consequently, a firm that has previously offshored more services experiences greater cost savings, and hence more favorable employment effects. These predictions are borne out strongly in the data, suggesting that service offshoring entails substantial productivity effects that benefit domestic employment in the firm.====The analysis proceeds by digging deeper into the rich micro data to shed some light on three interesting features of the employment effects at the intensive margin of service offshoring. First, splitting up service imports into high-income and low-income source countries reveals that the latter entails more favorable employment and wage effects. This pattern is in line with the expectation that services provided by low-income countries are more complementary to domestic employment in German firms in terms of task and skill requirements and are therefore more likely to benefit domestic workers (see Groizard et al., 2014). Second, one might suspect that service imports reflect not only activities that were previously conducted by the firm itself, but also those sourced from other German suppliers prior to offshoring. However, sample splits confirm that service offshoring increased employment irrespective of contemporaneous changes in domestic sourcing. Furthermore, the employment gains turn out to be even stronger for narrow offshoring (of the service type corresponding to the firm's own industry) and for firms in the service sector, where the substitution of domestic suppliers might be less relevant because firms engage in service activities themselves. Third, since the combined dataset includes information on all sizable foreign direct investment (FDI) links of German firms, it can be used to shed some first light on possible differences in the employment effects between intra-firm and arm's length service offshoring. The data show that the bulk of German service offshoring takes place via outsourcing, which strongly boosts domestic employment.====The positive employment effects at the intensive margin of service offshoring prove robust to several modifications of the IV strategy, alternative treatment of the data, and addressing various challenges to identification. They are also confirmed in different subperiods, in dynamic panel data models, and after accounting for possible selection into the dataset or into the service offshoring activity.====The analysis is completed by considering the extensive margin of service offshoring in a difference-in-differences propensity score matching approach. It compares employment changes in firms that start service offshoring for the first time to changes in a matched control group with similar initial conditions. This analysis reveals that newly offshoring firms experience non-negative employment effects over the subsequent one to five years. While the average treatment effect on the offshoring firms is even positive in the full sample pooled over all years, detailed annual analysis reveals that the estimated effects of starting service offshoring are insignificant in most years, but never negative.====This paper contributes to the literature estimating the labor market effects of offshoring, pioneered by Feenstra and Hanson, 1996a, Feenstra and Hanson, 1996b, Feenstra and Hanson, 1999. Focusing predominantly on the offshoring of manufactured inputs, numerous studies have applied their proxy for offshoring, which is based on industry-level imports and input-output tables, to the analysis of industry-level wages and employment.==== The same approach has further been applied to the analysis of worker-level wages.==== Recently, Hummels et al. (2014) have brought the analysis to firm-worker data for Denmark, which allows them to measure (and instrument for) offshoring using firm-level import data. Their approach has been adapted by Antràs et al. (2017) and Bernard et al. (2018) to investigate the impact of offshoring on firms' other sourcing and innovation activities. An alternative firm-level approach has exploited the activities of multinational enterprises' foreign affiliates to measure offshoring.==== Matching methods have been used to analyze the employment effects at the extensive margin of offshoring by Monarch et al. (2017), using firm offshoring events in the US, and by Moser et al. (2015), exploiting qualitative information from an establishment-level survey in Germany. The majority of these studies find that offshoring of manufactured inputs has small adverse effects on low-skilled workers' domestic employment or wages.====Amiti and Wei, 2005, Amiti and Wei, 2009a were the first to apply the approach developed by Feenstra and Hanson to services. They analyze the relationship between employment and service offshoring at the industry level in the UK and the US, where they find mixed evidence and rather small correlations. Crinò, 2010b, Crinò, 2012 further investigates the relative employment effects across skill groups in the US and Europe. He finds that service offshoring favors high-skilled employment, similar to offshoring of manufactured inputs.==== These findings are confirmed in worker-level wage data for the UK by Geishecker and Görg (2013), who also rely on the industry-level service offshoring measure. The two studies most closely related to this paper are Crinò (2010a) and Hijzen et al. (2011), who examine the link between service offshoring and firm-level employment. Crinò (2010a) applies matching methods to a cross-section of Italian firms to investigate the employment effects at the extensive margin of service offshoring, which turn out to be insignificant. While he compares firms that import services to those that do not, the German firm panel data allow me to extend this approach to a difference-in-differences setup, which examines ==== in employment in firms that ==== importing services, thereby controlling for time-invariant confounding factors. Hijzen et al. (2011) use detailed import data for the UK to show that increasing service offshoring coincides with higher employment growth. However, their approach does not address the likely endogeneity of offshoring, so they conclude that the positive correlation may be explained either by efficiency gains from offshoring or by simultaneity. This paper applies an IV strategy to eliminate the second possibility, and thus provides first causal evidence for the firm-level employment gains from increased service offshoring.====More broadly, the paper contributes to the literature analyzing service trade (surveyed by Francois and Hoekman, 2010), which is small compared to the abundance of research on goods trade. A distinguishing feature is the intangible and non-storable nature of services, which traditionally could be provided only face to face (Hill, 1977). By relaxing this requirement, advancements in ICT have contributed to a steep decline of international trade costs for many services over the past decades (see Hoekman and Braga, 1997; Freund and Weinhold, 2002). Despite the differences to goods trade, previous studies found that aggregate service trade is well explained by the traditional gravity equation (Kimura and Lee, 2006; Head et al., 2009). It was not until recent years that firm-level service trade data have become available, which have uncovered that service-trading firms are a small group, characterized by a similar and even more pronounced heterogeneity in terms of performance compared to goods traders (see most prominently Breinlich and Criscuolo, 2011, for the UK).==== The key advantage of the dataset used in this paper relative to previous studies is that it combines (close to) full coverage of German firms' service trade with information on firm employment and other key characteristics, which allows for a comprehensive analysis of causal effects.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the rich micro dataset of German firms' service trade compiled for this study. Section 3 describes the econometric model and the within-firm correlations between employment and service offshoring found in simple OLS regressions. Section 4 develops the IV strategy and uses it to estimate the employment effects at the intensive margin of service offshoring, followed by several deeper investigations. Section 5 analyzes the role of selection and the extensive margin of offshoring. The final section concludes with a brief discussion of the findings and their implications.",Service offshoring and firm employment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300091,March 2019,2019,Research Article,259.0

Our results provide insight into the regional labor market effects of trade, and have important implications for policies that address informal employment and that assist trade-displaced workers.","Since at least 1941, when Stolper and Samuelson (1941) published their seminal paper, economists have known that trade is likely to create winners and losers. A voluminous empirical literature then followed, investigating the differences in trade's effects on workers with different skills or employed in different industries. However, starting in the late 2000s, a number of authors documented substantial differences in the effects of trade and import competition on workers in geographic regions with different patterns of industrial specialization. Examples of this recent literature include Topalova (2007) and Kovak (2013), who investigated the regional effects of trade liberalization in India and Brazil respectively, and Autor et al. (2013), who documented the effects of increased Chinese imports on U.S. local labor markets.==== A robust conclusion from this literature is that trade's costs and benefits are unevenly distributed geographically, not just across industries or skills.====Given the substantial effects of trade liberalization across local labor markets, it is important to understand how workers and regional labor markets adjusted to these changes in local labor demand. Documenting these adjustments is essential to understanding the processes behind trade-displaced workers' labor market outcomes. In this paper, we examine various potential adjustment margins including earnings and wage changes; interregional migration; shifts between tradable and nontradable employment; and shifts between formal employment, informal employment, and non-employment.==== We compare outcomes for workers and regional labor markets facing larger and smaller tariff reductions, finding a rich pattern of labor market adjustment over time.====We make extensive use of longitudinal administrative data (RAIS) covering the Brazilian formal labor market between 1986 and 2010. These data cover the universe of formally employed workers and allow us to follow them over time and across firms, sectors, and regions. However, the RAIS data do not cover workers outside formal employment. To study the effects of liberalization on non-employment or informal employment, which are quite common in the Brazilian context, we use repeated cross-section data from decennial Demographic Censuses from 1970 to 2010. These data are representative at fine geographic levels and provide information on employment status, including informality, but do not allow one to follow individual workers over time.====Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that regions with different industry mixes are differently affected by Brazil's early 1990s trade liberalization. We find that workers initially employed in regions facing larger tariff declines (i) spend less and less time formally employed relative to workers in regions facing smaller tariff declines; (ii) are more likely to transition into nontradable sector employment, particularly in low-paying service industries, but these transitions do not make up for employment losses in the tradable sector; (iii) face similar losses when initially employed in tradable or nontradable sectors; and (iv) do not respond to depressed local labor market conditions by migrating to more favorably affected regions. We also show that harder-hit locations experience relative increases in non-employment and in informal employment in the medium run (1991 to 2000). However, in the long run (1991 to 2010) non-employment does not respond, and informal employment strongly increases. These results suggest that the informal sector eventually absorbs a significant portion of formerly trade-displaced workers who spent years non-employed following liberalization.====This paper relates to three literatures investigating the labor market effects of trade. First, we contribute to a recent but fast growing literature on the regional effects of trade, including Topalova (2007), Autor et al. (2013), Kovak (2013), and Hakobyan and McLaren (2016). While these papers focus on the regional effects at a particular time horizon, here we observe how the local labor market effects of liberalization evolve over time, both for individual workers and for regional economies. Second, our paper relates to a recent literature on worker-level effects of trade using longitudinal administrative datasets such as Menezes-Filho and Muendler (2011), Autor et al. (2014), Dauth et al. (2014), Keller and Utar (2016), and Utar (2018). Our paper differs from much of this prior literature by studying i) regional rather than industry shocks, ii) a discrete shock, allowing us to measure dynamic responses to liberalization, and iii) transitions into the nontradable sector and informal employment, which are salient features of the Brazilian context.==== Finally, our paper relates to the literature on trade and informality.==== We find substantial effects of trade policy on informality, with regions facing larger tariff reductions exhibiting larger increases in the informal share of working age population, particularly in the long run. These large effects contrast with a number of other papers studying Brazilian liberalization, which find minimal evidence for effects on informality. For example, industry-level studies such as Goldberg and Pavcnik (2003) and Bosch et al. (2012) found no significant effects of tariff reductions on informality within the relevant industries. Our regional approach broadens the scope of these industry-level analyses by capturing transitions into formal status even when they accompany transitions across industries in the same region. Menezes-Filho and Muendler (2011) observe yearly employment transitions for individual workers initially employed in manufacturing. While we lack worker panel data covering the informal sector, our regional analysis suggests that transitions into the formal sector often involve long periods of non-employment, which in many cases would be unobservable at a yearly frequency. Thus, the differences in findings can largely be reconciled by differences in research design, unit of analysis, and time horizons.====Our findings are also closely related to those in our prior work, which used a regional research design to document steady declines in relative formal sector earnings and employment growth in regions facing larger tariff reductions (Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2017). In that paper, we present evidence that the surprising growth in these effects results from dynamics in labor demand driven by a combination of slow capital reallocation and agglomeration economies. The present paper makes two additional contributions to our understanding of the margins of labor market adjustment following Brazilian liberalization. First, we employ a ==== research design to examine whether and to what extent individual workers in the formal sector adjust to liberalization-induced changes in labor demand by changing sectors or moving across regions. Second, we use Census data to examine effects on the labor market outside the formal sector, closely examining how liberalization affected informality and non-employment. These results complement those in the prior literature by providing a rich characterization of various margins of labor market adjustment to liberalization both for individual workers and regional labor markets.====These results have important implications regarding the regional labor market effects of trade. We show that labor market outcomes for formally employed workers initially located in regions more exposed to foreign competition steadily deteriorate over time relative to those in less exposed regions. These growing effects contrast with standard spatial equilibrium models (e.g. Blanchard and Katz (1992) and Bound and Holzer (2000)) and the empirical findings of Jacobson et al. (1993), in which workers' labor market outcomes eventually partially recover. Additionally, we show that non-employment strongly increases in harder-hit locations in the years immediately following liberalization, but that employment in these locations recovers in the longer run. This employment recovery is entirely accounted for by an increase in informal employment in harder-hit locations. In other words, after going through long periods of non-employment, trade-displaced formal-sector workers appear to eventually settle for informal employment. Given these findings, it is possible that policies discouraging informal employment may amplify the response of non-employment following a trade policy shock. We encourage future research investigating how labor market policies and institutions mediate the effects of liberalization.====Even though Brazil went through a major trade liberalization episode in the 1990s, it still remains a relatively protected economy, with import tariffs across sectors averaging 10.4%.==== Therefore, understanding how Brazilian labor markets adjusted to trade liberalization is useful to inform policy makers planning another wave of trade liberalization. In addition, although the Brazilian context differs in a variety of ways from that of higher income countries, our findings yield a number of insights that likely apply across contexts. We find that the labor market effects of liberalization fall not just upon workers in tradable industries, but also in non-tradable sectors. Indeed, non-tradable sectors experience falling labor demand due to local equilibrium effects, and absorb many displaced workers from tradable sectors. This cross-sector integration implies that policies such as Trade Adjustment Assistance in the U.S., targeting only trade-exposed industries, omit large numbers of workers whose employment and earnings prospects were indirectly affected by liberalization. Broader policies that cover all displaced workers or target depressed regions may better capture those directly and indirectly affected by tariff changes. We also show that displaced tradable sector workers who eventually find formal employment primarily transition into low-paying service industries. This pattern parallels the recent experiences in the U.S. and Western Europe, in which workers displaced from tradable sectors tend to find reemployment in low-wage service jobs (Goos and Manning, 2007; Autor and Dorn, 2013; Goos et al., 2014). We also find that in harder hit locations jobs shifted from the formal to the informal sector, which are widely perceived as (on average) lower-quality jobs due to the lack of enforcement of labor market regulations, increased job insecurity and the inability to benefit from unemployment insurance. Still, the informal sector seems to have worked as a cushion to trade-displaced workers' labor market outcomes. These results suggest a direction for future work in high-income countries, as self-employment and other more flexible work arrangements have become more common (for example, with the rise of the gig economy). As with Brazilian informality, these alternatives may provide a source of alternative employment for workers facing import competition. A full welfare analysis on the role of the informal sector in smoothing the labor market outcomes of trade-displaced workers is also a fruitful research avenue.====Our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the history and institutional context of Brazil's early 1990s trade liberalization. Section 3 describes the data sources used throughout the paper. Section 4 explains why trade liberalization had heterogeneous effects across regions and shows how we measure trade-induced local labor demand shocks. Section 5 investigates the effects of liberalization on worker-level labor market outcomes using longitudinal data from RAIS. Section 6 complements this analysis by investigating the effects of liberalization on the structure of local labor markets, with an emphasis on how regional formal employment, informal employment, and non-employment responded to the trade shocks. Section 7 concludes.",Margins of labor market adjustment to trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300078,March 2019,2019,Research Article,260.0

We find that the presence of active mines in firms' immediate vicinity (<20 km) deteriorates the business environment in tradeable sectors. Access to inputs and infrastructure becomes more constrained for these firms and this adversely affects their growth. In contrast, nearby active mines have a positive effect on firms in non-tradeable sectors. Moreover, we show that the presence of mines at a greater distance (21–150 km) relaxes business constraints of all firms, in line with positive regional spending effects.","The last two decades have witnessed an extraordinary expansion in global mining activity. A surge in commodity demand from industrializing countries pushed up the price of metals and minerals. This in turn led to substantial new mining investment, an increasing share of which is concentrated in emerging markets (Humphreys, 2010). This geographical shift reflects that many American and European mineral deposits have by now been depleted and that the long-distance transport of minerals by sea has become less costly. As a result, the world's largest mines can nowadays be found in Africa, Asia and Latin America.====The mining boom has also reinvigorated the debate about the impact of mining on economic activity and welfare. Some regard mines simply as stand-alone enclaves without a notable local impact (Hirschman, 1958). Others point to the potentially negative consequences of natural resource dependence such as real exchange rate appreciation, economic volatility, deindustrialization and corruption (see van der Ploeg (2011) for a comprehensive survey). Mines can also pollute and threaten the livelihoods of local food producers. They often require vast amounts of water, electricity, labor and infrastructure, for which they may compete with local manufacturers. Yet others stress the potential for ==== spillovers to firms and households as mining operators may buy local inputs and hire local employees.==== Local wealth can also increase if governments use taxable mining profits to invest in regional infrastructure or to make transfers to the local population.====Our paper informs this debate by estimating the impact of active mines on firms across nine countries with large mining sectors: Brazil, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russia and Ukraine. Our detailed data allow us to get around the endogeneity issues that plague country-level studies as well as the limitations to external validity of well-identified country-specific papers. Our empirical analysis is motivated by the “Dutch disease” model of Corden and Neary (1982) which sets out how a resource boom drives up wage costs for firms in the traded (manufacturing) sector as they compete for labor with firms in the resource and non-traded sectors. We hypothesize that mining companies and manufacturing firms also compete for other inelastically supplied inputs and public goods—such as transport infrastructure and electricity—and that this hurts tradeable-sector firms, which are price takers on world markets.====We test this hypothesis using three main data sets. First, we use detailed data on 25,777 firms from the EBRD-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) and the World Bank Enterprise Survey. These data contain the responses of firm managers to questions on the severity of various constraints to the operation and growth of their business, including access to transport infrastructure, electricity, land, educated workers and finance. A growing literature uses such survey data to gauge whether access to public goods affects firm performance.==== Firms' perceptions of the importance of external constraints on their activity can be used to find out which constraints affect economic activity the most (Carlin et al., 2010). These constraint variables measure competition for public goods directly, as they reflect firms' intended rather than actual use of such goods, and can therefore be interpreted as the shadow prices of public inputs. We exploit variation across firms in the reported severity of external constraints to assess how local mining activity, by affecting the quality and quantity of public good provision, influences the ability of local firms to grow.====Second, we use comprehensive firm-level panel data from Orbis. While Orbis does not include information on business constraints as perceived by firms, it does contain data on the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts of over 100,000 firms for on average five years. This allows us to measure the impact of mining by comparing one and the same firm before and after one or more mines open in its direct or wider vicinity.====Third, we use the proprietary SNL Metals & Mining data set, which contains comprehensive information on the geographical location, operating status and production data for individual mines. We identify the latitude and longitude of 5595 mines producing 31 different metals and minerals in our country sample. Depending on the year, we observe the operating status of between 1828 and 2511 mines.====Merging firm and mine data allows us to paint a precise and time-varying picture of the mines that open, operate and close around each firm. Since local mining activity is plausibly exogenous to the performance of individual firms—as it largely depends on local geology and world mineral prices—we can identify the impact of mining on local business constraints and firm performance. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to estimate this impact of mining activity on firm performance and to do so across a variety of countries.====Two core results emerge from our analysis, both consistent with a sub-national version of the seminal Corden and Neary (1982) model. First, in line with a “factor reallocation effect”, we uncover heterogeneous mining impacts in the immediate vicinity (≤ 20 km) of active mines that depend on whether a firm produces tradeable or non-tradeable goods. Only producers of tradeables that are close to active mines report tighter business constraints (as compared with similar firms that are not close to mines). These firms are especially hampered in their ability to access transport infrastructure and educated workers. Importantly, mining-induced business constraints have real effects in terms of total employment. Our results indicate that moving a producer of tradeables from an area without mines to an area with average mining intensity (2.7 mines) would reduce the number of employees by 2.2%. In contrast to firms in tradeable sectors, we find that nearby mining activity alleviates business constraints for firms in non-tradable sectors.====Second, in line with a sub-national “spending effect” we find that both tradeable and non-tradeable firms report an improvement in the provision of public goods if mining activity increases in a distance band of between 20 and 150 km around firms. This indicates that while mines can cause infrastructure bottlenecks in their immediate vicinity and crowd out other firms, they may improve transport infrastructure and other aspects of the business environment on a wider geographical scale. Such improvements may either reflect increased government spending or infrastructure investment by mining companies themselves.==== Two examples, both based on mines in our data set, can illustrate how mining can improve regional infrastructure. In Chile, starting up the Escondida copper mine required large investments in the local power supply. These investments reduced the cost of power in the wider Antofagasta region as well. Moreover, new roads were constructed between the mine and the Antofagasta region that were open for public use and hence reduced regional transport constraints (McPhail, 2009). In Indonesia, new roads were built when the Minahasa Raya gold mine was commissioned in 1994. These roads improved regional connectivity by better linking the mining area to Manado, the nearest regional capital. The resulting reduction in travel time had a positive effect on the local economy (Mamonto et al., 2012).====Our baseline results are based on regression specifications that include region-sector-year fixed effects so that we effectively compare—within one and the same region, sector, and year—firms with and without nearby mines. In robustness tests, we experiment with different ways to cluster our standard errors, assess the sensitivity of our results to excluding individual countries, and control for oil and gas fields. None of this affects the main results.====This paper contributes to a growing literature on the economic impact of natural resource abundance. Early contributions point to a negative cross-country correlation between resource exports and long-term economic growth (Sachs and Warner, 1997 and Auty, 2001). Various mechanisms have been proposed for why resource-rich countries appear unable to convert natural resources into productive assets. These include an appreciation of the real exchange rate which turns non-resource exports uncompetitive (the Dutch disease); worsening institutions and governance (Besley and Persson, 2010; Dell, 2010); rent seeking (Mehlum et al., 2006; Beck and Laeven, 2006) and increased conflict (Collier and Hoeffler, 2004; Miguel et al., 2004). The cross-country evidence remains mixed—reflecting thorny endogeneity issues—and the very existence of a resource curse continues to be heavily debated (van der Ploeg and Poelhekke, 2010; James, 2015).====To strengthen identification, recent papers exploit micro data to estimate the impact of natural resource discoveries on local living standards.====Aragón and Rud (2013) show how the Yanacocha gold mine in Peru improved incomes and consumption of nearby households. Their findings indicate that mining can have positive local equilibrium effects if backward linkages are strong enough.====Lippert (2014) and Loayza and Rigolini (2016) also document positive impacts on living standards for Zambia and Peru, respectively. For the case of Ghana, Fafchamps, Koelle and Shilpi (2017) find that gold mining has led to agglomeration effects that benefit non-farm activities.==== Consistent with these country studies, Von der Goltz and Barnwall (2019) show for a sample of developing countries that mining boosts local wealth but often comes at the cost of pollution and negative health impacts.====We contribute to this nascent literature in two ways. First, we shift the focus from households to firms to gain insights into the mechanisms through which mining affects local economic activity (and ultimately household incomes).==== We not only observe firm outcomes but also the mechanisms through which mining activity hampers some sectors but benefits others. Second, using harmonized micro data from a diverse set of countries with large mining and manufacturing sectors adds to the internal as well as external validity of our results.====Our paper also relates to a small parallel literature on local oil and gas booms in the United States. Michaels (2011) and Allcott and Keniston (2018) show that historical hydrocarbon booms benefited county-level economic growth through positive agglomeration effects, backward and forward linkages, and lower transport costs.==== In contrast, find that the US oil and gas boom of the 1970s led to negative long-term income effects. They suggest that contrary to booms in the more distant past (as studied by Michaels, 2011) the persistent negative effects of the 1970s boom offset any long-term positive agglomeration effects. We assess whether our results are sensitive to the presence of oil and gas production by extending our regressions with the number of oil and gas fields (if any) around each firm.====We also contribute to work on the relationship between the business environment and firm performance. This literature has moved from using country-level proxies for the business environment (Kaufmann, 2002) to firm-level, survey-based indicators of business constraints. Dethier et al. (2011) point to the typically strong correlation between firms' subjective assessments of the severity of business constraints and more objective indicators. For instance, Pierre and Scarpetta (2004) show that in countries with strict labor regulations there is a higher share of firms that report labor regulations as a problem. While various papers find negative correlations between firm-level indicators of business constraints and firm performance, endogeneity concerns linger.====Commander and Svejnar (2011) link firm performance in 26 transition countries to firms' own assessments of aspects of the business environment. They conclude that once country fixed effects are included, firms' perceptions of business constraints add little explanatory power. Our contribution is to use exogenous shocks that stem from the opening of large-scale mines to help mitigate the endogeneity concerns that continue to plague this literature.====Another related literature investigates the negative externalities (congestion) and positive externalities (agglomeration) of geographically concentrated economic activity.==== Congestion occurs when firms compete for a limited supply of infrastructure or other public goods.==== Agglomeration effects emerge when spatially proximate firms benefit from deeper local labor markets, the better availability of services and intermediate goods, and knowledge spillovers (Marshall, 1920). In line with agglomeration benefits, Greenstone et al. (2010) show that US firms close to new large plants experience positive productivity spillovers. We assess whether newly opened mines mainly lead to positive agglomeration or negative congestion effects for nearby and more distant firms.====Lastly, this paper also speaks to recent work on the impact of (exogenous) local labor supply shocks, in the form of immigration, on specialization across sectors. Hong and McLaren (2015) show theoretically and empirically (for the U.S.) how positive immigration shocks not only increase local labor supply but also the local demand for non-traded services. This raises real wages through entry and leads to more employment in the non-tradeables sector (Brezis and Krugman (1996) provide a similar theoretical framework). Relatedly, Peters (2017) uses a two-sector (agriculture and manufacturing) general equilibrium model to guide his analysis of the local impact of ethnic Germans migrating to Germany after WWII. He shows how migrant inflows, by increasing the size of local markets and related agglomeration effects, can encourage firm entry. The two main mechanisms that we consider when assessing the local impact of mining activity are closely related to this literature. First, while the above papers analyze a positive labor supply shock, the opening of mines can drive up wages and attract workers from other sectors, which is a negative labor supply shock from the perspective of those sectors (the factor reallocation effect). Second, the profits from natural resources, and the higher wages and/or the increase in the local population due to immigration, can increase the local demand for non-tradeables (the spending effect).====We proceed as follows. Section2 derives our main hypotheses based on a structured discussion of related theoretical literature. 3 Data, 4 Empirical strategy then describe our data and empirical strategy, after which Section5 presents our results.

This paper estimates the costs of non-compliance with U.S. product standards, using a new database on U.S. import refusals from 2002 to 2014. We find that import refusals decrease exports to the United States. This trade reducing effect is driven by developing countries and by refusals without any product sample analysis, in particular during the Subprime Crisis and its aftermath. We also provide evidence that given product standards were enforced more strictly during the crisis while the quality of imported products did not deteriorate. These results are consistent with the existence of counter-cyclical, hidden protectionism due to non-tariff barriers to trade in the United States.","Non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs) such as product standards and technical regulations have gained in importance compared to tariffs that are at historical lows.==== The discussion on NTBs is characterized by two opposing trends. While some countries aim at harmonizing product standards to reap further gains from trade (e.g., recently stalled trade talks between the United States and the European Union), fear of protectionism has led to a close monitoring of NTBs worldwide during the Great Recession (e.g., Baldwin and Evenett, 2009).====Product standards are imposed to overcome market failures and to protect the health of domestic consumers. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the safety of domestic and foreign products through the enforcement of U.S. product standards. Those products not complying with U.S. product standards are refused entry into the market by the FDA. For domestic products, the FDA needs to prove a violation to deny access to the U.S. market. In the case of imports, however, the FDA has the authority to refuse import shipments that “[only] appear to violate” a certain U.S. product standard (Liu, 2010). This formulation in Section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act leaves considerable room for discriminatory action of FDA officials with respect to imports. We analyze this important issue by collecting a new data set that combines disaggregated import data from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) with import refusals from the FDA.====We estimate the impact of U.S. product standards enforcement on trade using a bilateral gravity model for 93 imported product-groups to the United States for the years 2002 to 2014. Our main variable of interest, import refusals, is a ====. This variable captures all incidences of non-compliance with U.S. product standards, i.e., when a given legal technical regulation indeed bites. First, we show that the negative impact of import refusals on imports to the United States is substantial for poorer countries. While OECD countries are largely unaffected, our estimates imply that a one standard deviation increase in refusals reduces short- and long-run exports from an average non-OECD country by USD 2.8 to 5 billion. Second, by examining the type of inspection that underlies a given import refusal, we show that the trade reducing effect is mainly triggered by refusals without any product sample analysis, which are arguably more prone to discriminatory action. Third, this type of import refusals dampens U.S. imports in particular during the Subprime Crisis and its aftermath, even when controlling for legal changes in U.S. product standards regulation (as measured by U.S. notifications to the WTO SPS and TBT agreements) and for the quality of U.S. imports (as reported by the IMF). This suggests that existing U.S. product standards were enforced more strictly during the crisis. We conclude that these results for the United States are consistent with (but do not prove) hidden protectionism due to ====.====Why are thousands of shipments blocked from entering the U.S. market each year? The FDA names two main reasons for import refusals: adulteration and misbranding. Recent reports on blocked U.S. imports of toys containing lead fall in the first category with products being inferior and entailing substantial health risks.==== But adulteration can also simply stem from differing product standards between trading countries. Second, a product might be denied entry into the United States due to misbranding, i.e., U.S. labelling standards are not met or necessary certificates for conformity assessment are not provided by the exporter. However, the enforcement of product standards differs between domestic and foreign producers in an important dimension that might open the door for hidden protectionism. For domestic products, the FDA needs to prove a violation to deny access to the U.S. market, whereas in the case of imports it has the authority to refuse shipments that “[only] appear to violate” a certain U.S. product standard (Liu, 2010).====This legal difference is important, since rich anecdotal evidence exists that the FDA like many other U.S. institutions is subject to lobbying and political pressures.==== In one of its most controversial moves, the FDA issued an outright ban of all grapes from Chile in March 1989 due to a non-lethal contamination of two grapes with cyanide (Engel, 1999; Hawthorne, 2005). It remains unclear to date whether the FDA simply overreacted or the U.S. government aimed for a weakening of the Pinochet regime. Similar to technical regulations (see Trefler, 1993 and Essaji, 2008), stricter enforcement of product standards may be imposed due to protectionist motives. Lamb (2006) provides anecdotal evidence that political pressure from U.S. avocado producer associations drove the boycott of Mexican Hass avocados until 1997. More recently, U.S. catfish producers have lobbied for more frequent inspections of catfish imports to protect their industry.==== In 2015, Canada and Mexico were authorized by the WTO to retaliate against the meat labelling requirement (COOL) that the U.S. had put into force at the height of the financial crisis in 2009.====Economic theory suggests that trade policy becomes more protectionist during economic downturns (Bagwell and Staiger, 2003). Graph 1 sheds some first light on stricter enforcement of U.S. product standards during the Subprime Crisis and its aftermath. It shows that the total number of shipments inspected by the FDA increased sharply from <140,000 in 2008 to close to 280,000 in 2011, staying close to its peak in the years thereafter. These FDA-inspections include inspections with and without a product sample analysis. Strikingly, after a strong rise, incidences of non-compliance with U.S. product standards fell again hand in hand with the decreasing unemployment rate. This is even more remarkable if one considers that imports have resurged after the crisis (Graph 2) and that the product quality of U.S. imports has not changed during the crisis and its aftermath (Levshenko et al. 2011). It is also noteworthy that import refusals without any product sample analysis dominate the evolution of total import refusals, because this type of inspection is arguably prone to hidden protectionism.====Our paper contributes to the existing literature in several ways. First, we contribute to the recent empirical literature on protectionism (see Rose, 2013; Bown and Crowley, 2013; Kee et al., 2013) by highlighting another channel through which governments might temporarily seek import protection: a stricter enforcement of product standards. While ==== changes in product standards need to be reported to the WTO, ==== changes in given product standards such as stricter border inspections might fly below the radar of international policy makers. We are to the best of our knowledge the first to consider the type of inspection leading to import refusals and to link the effect of import refusals to the business cycle. Second, we add to the trade and development literature by quantifying the short- and long-run trade costs due to non-compliance with U.S. product standards. Most alternative measures of product standards, e.g., notifications to the WTO, are based on technical regulations that are most favoured nation (MFN) measures without variation across exporters. In contrast, our measure substantially varies across countries, product-groups and time. This allows us to factor in that any potential import protection is trading partner- and product-specific and to control for country-product-specific factors that are often omitted in other studies. Third, we contribute to the literature on import refusals by addressing the endogenous nature of refusals through an instrumentation strategy. Import refusals can be endogenous due to import protection or risk-guided inspections. Product-groups with increasing imports are more closely monitored and inspected by the FDA.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 discuss the related literature and the institutional background of the FDA. Sections 4 and 5 present our data set, the empirical strategy and the results.

The model highlights the need to estimate labour market outcomes using ==== in the outcomes of individual workers and, in particular, to distinguish workers who switch ‘up’ from those who switch ‘down’. (Switching ‘down’ means switching to an occupation that pays less on average than the current occupation). We apply these insights to matched CPS data for 1996–2007. The cumulative 10-year impact of rising service imports from China and India has been as follows. (1) Downward occupational switching increased by 7 percentage points, from 21% to 28%, and upward occupational switching increased by 6 percentage points, from 17% to 23%. (2) Transitions to unemployment were imprecisely measured to have increased by half a percentage point, potentially raising the white-collar unemployment rate from 3.0% to 3.5%. (3) The earnings average across all ==== fell by a small 1%. However, for the sub-population of workers who switched down or became unemployed, earnings fell by 15% and 47%, respectively. (4) Service exports had partially offsetting effects on switching and unemployment.","As measured by the value added in U.S. trade flows, service imports are now almost as large as merchandise imports and service exports are now much larger than merchandise exports.==== Yet the impact of trade on U.S. labour market outcomes remains dominated by analysis of merchandise trade e.g., Autor et al. (2013). There are several reasons to consider service trade independently of merchandise trade. First, the total impact of trade on U.S. workers is the sum of the impacts of merchandise and service trade. The effects documented in this paper are thus ==== the effects documented elsewhere. Second, the service tradability ‘revolution’ and the accompanying rise of service offshoring to China and India has a major new implication for American workers: for the first time ever educated U.S. workers are competing with educated but low-paid foreign workers. It is thus far from clear that current estimates of the elasticities of labour-market outcomes with respect to merchandise imports are relevant for service imports. Third, service imports penetrate more pervasively into the economy than do traditional merchandise imports: By most estimates the number of U.S. jobs now exposed to service imports is at least double the size of total manufacturing employment (van Welsum and Reif, 2006; Blinder, 2009, and Jensen et al., 2010). Yet the impact of service trade on labour-market outcomes in the U.S. and elsewhere remains scant.====We use an under-exploited and obvious source of data to study the impacts of service offshoring. In constructing the official statistics on service trade, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) surveys private-sector firms across all sectors of the economy and asks questions about the type of services each firm exports and sources from abroad. These exports and imports involve unaffiliated or arm's length trade. We follow the Ebenstein et al. (2014) approach to constructing a measure of occupational exposure to service imports and exports and use it to study labour-market impacts at the individual-occupation level. For example, we study impacts on worker-level occupational switching. This occupational orientation is particularly valuable in light of research by Ebenstein et al. (2014) who show that merchandise trade impacts are large at the occupational level.====The first contribution of this paper is its focus on service trade. The second contribution is its focus on occupational switching and unemployment. The largest costs of import competition are likely borne by those who must change their labour market status. For example, occupational switches, industry switches, and unemployment transitions have profound implications for workers' lifetime welfare.====Despite these well-known costs of occupational switching and unemployment, there has been no analysis of how trade in services creates or mitigates such costs. To fill the gap, we examine the impact of service trade from China and India – i.e., of competition from low-wage educated labour – on occupational switching, the incidence of unemployment, and earnings. Our results complement studies based on merchandise trade shocks by Kletzer, 1998, Kletzer, 2001, Crino (2010a), Baumgarten et al. (2013), Ebenstein et al. (2014), Hummels et al. (2014) and Autor et al. (2014). These are reviewed below.====The third and final focus of this paper is motivated by welfare analysis and policy responses to rising imports. As noted by Gibbons and Katz (1992) and many others, these responses depend critically on the role played by worker sorting. If sorting is unimportant then high-paying occupations likely reflect ‘good jobs’ (e.g., unionized jobs or jobs associated with efficiency wages) and there are large welfare losses when these good jobs move to China and India. On the other hand, if worker sorting is important then the welfare losses are more moderate. In terms of policy, in a good-jobs world, strategic trade policy is warranted (Krugman, 1986) whereas in a sorting world the right policies are ones that improve the match between workers and firms.====In order to address these issues we imbed a partial equilibrium variant of the Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) model of trade in tasks into the Ohnsorge and Trefler (2007) general equilibrium model of occupational choice. The latter is a Ricardian-Roy model in which workers with unobserved heterogeneous attributes sort across occupations that have heterogeneous returns to these attributes. The trade-in-tasks aspect of the model plays the limited role of motivating the need for and choice of instruments to deal with the endogeneity of imports and exports. Empirically, we find that this endogeneity is not important. The sorting aspect of the model helps in two ways. First, it clarifies the type of assumption needed to identify the impact of trade on the earnings of occupational switchers. A strong identification assumption is that workers sort only on observable characteristics and have no unobserved heterogeneity. This assumption is essentially made by Artuç et al. (2010). Under this assumption, we can use propensity-score matching to estimate an average treatment effect (ATE). A weaker identification assumption is that workers sort only on observables, but have unobserved heterogeneity. This assumption is made by Caliendo et al. (2015). The weak identification assumption leads to a very different estimation strategy and generates three conclusions. (1) The estimated earnings effects are similar to the ATEs based on propensity scoring. (2) The parameter estimates imply that workers are sorting based on unobserved characteristics. (3) The parameter estimates support the sorting mechanism described by our model. As noted, our finding of a prominent role for sorting is important for policy.====Turning to our empirical work, we combine CPS data for 1996–2007 with detailed BEA data on bilateral service transactions between the United States and 31 trade partners. To examine the impact of service trade on occupational switching, transitions to unemployment, and earnings we use March-to-March matched CPS data.==== An unexpected prediction of the model is that there will be differences between workers who switch up to higher-paying occupations versus those who switch down to lower-paying occupations. A high-paying occupation is one that pays well even after controlling for observed worker characteristics. That is, it is the occupational fixed effect in a Mincer wage regression and is often called the ‘inter-occupational wage differential.’ We find that rising service imports from China and India have had the following cumulative 10-year impacts. (1) Downward occupational switching increased by 6.8 percentage points (from 21% to 27.8%) indicating a 32% increase and upward occupational switching increased by 5.8 percentage points (from 17% to 22.8%) indicating a 34% increase. (2) Transitions to unemployment were large but imprecisely measured to have increased by half a percentage point, potentially raising the white-collar unemployment rate from 3.0% to 3.5%. (3) The earnings average across all white collar workers fell by a small 1%. However, for the sub-population of workers who switched down or became unemployed, earnings fell by 15% and 47%, respectively.==== (4) Service exports had partially offsetting effects on switching and unemployment.====The paper is organized as follows.

The optimal policy is to tranch the risky fiscal capacity and then to issue state-contingent assets that pay only when the need for aggregate liquidity in the economy is high. In this way, governments can minimize wasted liquidity of public assets: unused returns on public assets not required by domestic investors. This minimizes the cost of liquidity hoarding for the domestic private sector, which increases investment and welfare in the economy. This study also provides a framework to analyze relevant comparative statics regarding the ownership of state-contingent public assets. In particular, the model assesses the effects of changes in the domestic liquidity needs, the state's fiscal capacity, and the foreign willingness to pay for public debt on the ownership of state-contingent public assets.","In modern economies, investors value public debt for its liquidity (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2012; Bolton and Jeanne, 2011; Gennaioli et al., 2014). This is particularly true in emerging economies where, owing to limited access to international capital markets, investors have fewer options in terms of storing liquidity (Asonuma et al., 2015; Gennaioli et al., 2018).====Many researchers have studied public liquidity provision using a single bond (Holmstrom and Tirole, 1998; Woodford, 1990; Aiyagari and McGrattan, 1998; Holmstrom and Tirole, 2011; Guerrieri and Lorenzoni, 2009; Angeletos et al., 2016), focusing on the optimal quantity of debt. However, relatively less is known about the optimal public debt structure when governments issue multiple debt instruments. Therefore, this is the focus of this study.====Studying the optimal public debt structure with multiple debt instruments is relevant because, in practice, governments issue a wide variety of assets in public debt markets.====To examine the optimal public debt structure, this study uses a model with the following three key elements. First, domestic investors use public debt as collateral. Second, public debt markets are open to risk-neutral foreign investors, who demand public debt as a saving vehicle. Third, the government commits to repaying the assets it issues, but is constrained by its risky fiscal capacity, rendering public debt risky.====In this environment, the optimal policy is for the government to tranch its risky fiscal capacity and then to issue state-contingent assets. Under the optimal public debt structure, the government issues assets that pay only when the need for aggregate liquidity in the economy is high. In doing so, they minimize unused returns on public assets that are not required by domestic investors (assets' wasted liquidity). This minimizes the cost of liquidity hoarding for the domestic private sector, which increases investment and welfare in the economy.====The introduction of state-contigent public assets has long-standing support in academic and policy circles (Fischer, 1983; Gale, 1990; Shiller, 1993; Allen and Gale, 1994; Caballero, 2002; Blanchard et al., 2016; IMF, 2017). The primary motivation for state-contingent public assets, according to this literature, is to increase risk-sharing opportunities. Instead, in this study, the motivation for state-contingent public assets is the optimal public provision of liquidity.====The most relevant state-contingent public assets are index-linked securities, bonds whose payments are linked to an inflation index, a commodity price (e.g. oil, gold), or to a reference interest rate (Allen and Gale, 1994). Other state-contingent public assets indexed, for example, to GDP, government revenues or nominal wages are quantitatively minor (IMF, 2017).====The current study provides a framework to analyze relevant comparative statics regarding the ownership of state-contingent public assets. In particular, the model assesses the effects of changes in the domestic liquidity needs, the state's fiscal capacity, and the foreign willingness to pay for public debt on the ownership of state-contingent public assets.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

Lowering the policy interest rate to stimulate member economies in recession runs the risk of overheating member economies at or above full employment output. Optimal policy requires the central bank to stabilize union wide average inflation, leaving a combination of fiscal policy and financial market integration to fulfill the idiosyncratic stabilization role that the central bank cannot play.==== While federations like the United States, Canada, the U.K., and Germany smooth over 80% of the impact of local shocks through a combination of fiscal transfers and financial market integration, the euro area only insures half that amount with no centralized fiscal authority or fiscal union and comparatively little transnational risk-sharing through financial markets (IMF (2013)).====The relative paucity of cross-border risk-sharing in the euro area has prompted considerable debate about the need for fiscal transfers between member states. However, much of the theoretical research on fiscal stabilization in monetary unions has been conducted under the assumption of perfect cross-country risk-sharing.==== For example, Farhi and Werning (2017) analyze the transfer problem in a dynamic sticky price model under the widely used Cole-Obstfeld (1991) calibration which specifies log utility in consumption as well as unitary elasticities of substitution between the products of each country — so-called trade elasticities. Under this calibration full consumption risk-sharing is provided by terms of trade movements, as export revenues are constant in the presence of asymmetric productivity shocks due to offsetting income and substitution effects. While Farhi and Werning (2017) demonstrate a macroeconomic stabilization role for transfers even under perfect cross-country risk-sharing, the potential welfare gains are small, as the risk-sharing benefits of transfers are nullified by assumption.====We differ from the theoretical literature along two key dimensions in our study of the optimal transfer union. First, we solve for optimal transfers in an environment of imperfect cross-country risk-sharing, away from complete markets and without restrictive assumptions on trade elasticities or household risk aversion. Second, we focus on wage rigidities instead of price rigidities.====Evers, 2012, Evers, 2015 takes a more quantitative approach and considers ==== fiscal rules in a medium scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with imperfect risk-sharing, price and wage rigidities, and physical capital for a specific calibration of parameters.==== In his calibration stabilizing labor income delivers higher welfare than stabilizing consumption. Our focus is more theoretical. We identify efficiency wedges, solve the model and the optimal policy problem analytically, and derive a general constrained-efficient fiscal transfer rule that carefully delineates the role of trade elasticities, consumption home bias and imperfect cross-country risk-sharing.====To study optimal transfers, we lay down a tractable model of a monetary union composed of a continuum of small open economies which face incomplete financial markets, one period in advance nominal wage rigidities and asymmetric productivity shocks. We define a transfer union as a revenue-neutral stabilization program, facilitated by cross-country payments, that ensures member states against the vagaries of asymmetric shocks over the business cycle. In the model there are two distortions that move allocations away from the Pareto optimum: a labor wedge which reflects deviations from the flexible wage allocation, and a consumption wedge which reflects deviations from the complete markets allocation.==== The log-linearized labor wedge is zero in the flexible wage allocation, while the log-linearized consumption wedge is zero in the complete markets allocation. The labor wedge corresponds to the distance between the marginal cost and benefit of labor in each country. Whenever the product of the real wage and the marginal utility of consumption exceeds the marginal disutility of labor, the labor wedge is positive. The consumption wedge corresponds to the efficiency of the transfer allocation. The marginal utility of the transfer is equal to the marginal utility of consumption divided by the domestic consumer price index. In complete markets the marginal utility of an additional transfer unit is equal across countries. If the marginal utility of an additional transfer unit is larger than its average value in the union, the consumption wedge is positive.====Our key theoretical result is that the optimal transfer scheme stabilizes a weighted average of the labor and consumption wedges, where the former enters with a weight equal to consumption home bias and the latter one minus home bias (==== trade openness). As home bias increases, more income is spent on domestically produced goods, such that transfers provide a more substantial boost to labor demand and are more influential in closing the labor wedge. Transfers are thus more effective for higher values of home bias, irrespective of the economy's asset market structure. Under full home bias we arrive at the closed economy, where transfers focus only on closing the labor wedge. As home bias shrinks, transfers have less impact on the labor wedge as more spending goes to imported goods. As a result, stabilizing the labor wedge generates too much consumption volatility, and the optimal transfer places relatively more weight on minimizing the consumption wedge. In the limit with no home bias, transfers do not affect labor demand or domestic production, as households spend all income on imports. Although the labor wedge may still generate large welfare losses in a fully open economy, particularly when domestic products are highly substitutable with foreign products, transfers are powerless to ameliorate this distortion when domestic households consume a basket of goods made up entirely of imports. Thus, the optimal transfer scheme in a fully open economy focuses exclusively on minimizing the consumption wedge and replicates the decentralized complete markets allocation, which is not Pareto optimal as the labor wedge is still present.====Our optimal transfer rule, which considers all possible values for home bias, sheds light on Evers' (2012) conclusions about the advantages of stabilizing labor income at the expense of more volatile consumption. The emphasis on strongly stabilizing labor income in Evers' optimal fiscal rule is likely to hold only for economies that are relatively closed, as he sets home bias to 85% in his numerical simulations. The empirical range for home bias in our sample of euro area countries is 30% (Czech Republic) to 78% (Italy). For very open economies like the Czech Republic, Austria, and the Netherlands, stabilizing consumption is more important than stabilizing labor income in the optimal transfer rule.====The weights in the optimal transfer rule — home bias on the labor wedge and trade openness on the consumption wedge — hold independently of trade elasticities. However, trade elasticities do influence the size of the wedges themselves, which in turn determine the welfare losses from asymmetric shocks, the size of necessary transfers, and the attendant welfare gains from the optimal transfer union. In particular, higher trade elasticities generate larger wedges which increase the welfare losses from asymmetric shocks, increase the size of necessary transfers, and raise the welfare gains from the optimal transfer union. The combination of non-unitary trade elasticities, wage rigidity and asymmetric productivity shocks is particularly salient for the euro area. In a monetary union with wage rigidity, a negative productivity shock lowers a country's export competitiveness, resulting in a loss of external demand for the domestically produced good. This effect strengthens as a country's trade elasticity increases. Unlike wage rigidity, price rigidity in a monetary union dampens the welfare loss from negative productivity shocks as it helps member states preserve their export market share.====While the focus of our study is on non-unitary trade elasticities, we also obtain new results for the Cole-Obstfeld case. We show that a competitive equilibrium with wages set one period in advance, unitary trade elasticities and log utility of consumption is Pareto optimal, such that transfers are unnecessary. In contrast, in a model with price rigidity Farhi and Werning (2017) find the decentralized allocation under the Cole-Obstfeld calibration is inefficient. This discrepancy highlights the importance of sticky wages ==== sticky prices. Under Cole-Obstfeld, the labor and consumption wedges are absent with wage rigidity, while under price rigidity terms of trade movements cancel out the consumption wedge but not the labor wedge. Thus, when prices are sticky, the presence of the labor wedge in the decentralized perfect cross-country risk-sharing allocation creates a role for transfers. Away from the Cole-Obstfeld case, the consumption and labor wedges are present under both types of nominal rigidity, and positive welfare gains from transfers result.====To estimate the welfare gains from optimal transfers we move from the intuitive baseline setup to a richer environment, where we substitute one period in advance wage rigidity with Calvo wage rigidity. We consider the welfare gains from optimal transfers for three decentralized allocations: financial autarky, incomplete markets and complete markets.==== In this extended version of the model we solve for the optimal transfer scheme numerically with respect to different values of home bias, wage rigidity, and trade elasticities. Our quantitative exercise demonstrates that the welfare gains from optimal transfers are potentially much larger than previous studies have estimated. For the average euro area economy, the welfare gains from optimal transfers range from 0.50% of permanent consumption under complete markets and low wage rigidity to 6.09% of permanent consumption under financial autarky and high wage rigidity.====The welfare gains from optimal transfers depend on three key parameters: the degree of wage rigidity, trade elasticities and consumption home bias. First, we show that the welfare gains from transfers grow with wage rigidity. By construction, stickier wages increase the labor wedge. In imperfect risk-sharing environments, an economy with more rigid wages will also face a larger consumption wedge following a negative productivity shock, as lower employment income translates to lower consumption. The labor and consumption wedges and thus the inefficiency of the competitive equilibrium, the size of optimal transfers, and the welfare gains from optimal transfers all rise with wage rigidity. A combination of high wage rigidity, high trade elasticities, and market incompleteness leads to very inefficient decentralized allocations, where large welfare gains from transfers are possible. On the other hand, the gains from transfers are negligible when wages are flexible because the competitive equilibrium is so efficient, regardless of trade openness, market completeness and trade elasticities. Since economies outside a monetary union can replicate the flexible wage allocation through independent monetary policy and nominal exchange rate movements, the welfare gains from transfers are negligible. These findings are in line with Auray and Eyquem (2014), who show that monetary union allocations are a clear second best to flexible exchange rate allocations from a welfare perspective when economies face asymmetric shocks and nominal rigidities.====Second, as domestic goods become closer substitutes with foreign goods, a negative home productivity shock leads to a larger decline in home exports and a substitution of domestic goods with imports in the absence of currency or wage adjustment, due to increased expenditure switching from home and foreign consumers. A decrease in production causes a decline in income and aggregate demand, which further diminishes labor and consumption and raises both wedges. The Cole-Obstfeld calibration mitigates this negative feedback loop and the distortionary impact of higher product substitutability. Recent estimates of aggregate trade elasticities for euro area countries fall in the range of three to five (Corbo and Osbat 2013, Imbs and Méjean 2015). This has important implications for welfare, as higher trade elasticities enhance the distortionary impact of asymmetric shocks in a monetary union, and strengthen the need for a transfer union.====Third, the effect of home bias on the welfare gains from optimal transfers is dependent on asset market structure. There are two channels through which home bias impacts welfare: transfer effectiveness and the inefficiency of the competitive equilibrium. First, transfers are more effective in stabilizing domestic production and hence reducing the labor wedge as home bias increases. As a larger proportion of domestic spending goes toward domestic goods, transfers have a larger impact on domestic labor demand and hours worked, and are thus more effective. Second, home bias impacts the size of the labor and consumption wedges and hence the inefficiency of the decentralized allocations. The first channel operates independently of financial market structure, while the second channel is sensitive to financial market structure.====These two channels — the effectiveness of transfers and the inefficiency of the decentralized allocation — work in the same direction under financial autarky. As home bias strengthens, the consumption and labor wedges become more correlated and thus the competitive equilibrium is less efficient. Following a negative productivity shock consumption falls, driving down demand for the domestic good and kickstarting a standard Keynesian multiplier effect between consumption and income which strengthens as home bias rises. Thus, in financial autarky the welfare losses from asymmetric shocks and wage rigidity, the inefficiency of the decentralized allocation, transfer effectiveness and the welfare gains from transfers all grow with home bias.====In contrast, when markets are complete transfer effectiveness and the inefficiency of the decentralized allocation move in the opposite direction. Complete markets stabilize consumption through perfect cross-country insurance, which in turn stabilizes labor income. Because the consumption and labor wedges are more correlated as home bias increases, the labor wedge shrinks and the efficiency of the decentralized allocation increases with home bias under complete markets. Consequently, the welfare gains from transfers under complete markets have an inverse U-shape with respect to home bias. Very open economies exhibit smaller welfare gains from transfers in this environment, as transfers are less effective in closing the labor wedge as home bias shrinks. In relatively closed economies, the consumption wedge is absent and the labor wedge is small in the decentralized allocation, such that transfers have little to improve. Economies with intermediate values of home bias, which are the most empirically plausible, exhibit the largest gains from transfers in both incomplete and complete markets as transfer effectiveness and the inefficiency of the competitive equilibrium align to generate the largest welfare impact.",Optimal fiscal transfers in a monetary union,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199619300042,March 2019,2019,Research Article,265.0

Recent literature has emphasised the key role of imperfections in international financial markets in creating a trade-off between internal and external objectives of monetary policy. The aim of this paper is to extend the analysis of this question to a model with international trade in multiple assets but where there are insufficient assets to hedge against all sources of shocks simultaneously. We show that monetary policy can have a significant effect on welfare via its impact on portfolio allocation. This provides a strong incentive to direct monetary policy away from internal objectives (i.e. inflation stabilisation) and towards an external objective (i.e. stabilisation of the real exchange rate around its first-best level).====This paper is a contribution to a long-running literature on optimal monetary policy in open economies. The early literature emphasised that open economy factors need have no explicit role in the design of optimal cooperative monetary policy rules. For instance, Benigno and Benigno (2003) showed that optimal cooperative monetary policy should focus on targeting the rate of inflation of producer prices.==== These authors demonstrate that a policy of inflation targeting is sufficient to close all internal and external welfare gaps. There is therefore no trade-off between internal and external policy objectives.==== This early open economy literature, however, focused on models where international financial markets are complete. Households can therefore fully hedge against country specific income shocks. More recent literature has begun to analyse monetary policy in open economy models where financial markets are incomplete. For instance, Corsetti et al., 2010, Corsetti et al., 2018 analyse cooperative monetary policy in a context where international financial trade is absent or is restricted to a single non-contingent bond. They show that, in contrast to the previous literature, when international financial markets are incomplete there are significant internal and external trade-offs that prevent optimal cooperative policy from simultaneously closing all welfare relevant gaps.====The basic intuition for the Corsetti et al., 2010, Corsetti et al., 2018 results is simple to explain. A policy of producer price inflation targeting reproduces the flexible price outcome and therefore eliminates the welfare costs associated with staggered price setting. But the flexible price equilibrium is not fully optimal because international financial markets are imperfect and thus cross-country income risks are not optimally shared. A corollary of this is that the real exchange rate and trade balance will deviate from their first best outcomes. Corsetti et al., 2010, Corsetti et al., 2018 show that optimal cooperative policy deviates from inflation targeting and takes account of external welfare gaps and acts to offset exchange rate misalignments.====The results in Corsetti et al., 2010, Corsetti et al., 2018 clearly point to a potentially important deviation from the standard policy prescription of inflation targeting. There is however a significant limitation to Corsetti et al's work. In Corsetti et al. (2010) the analysis of imperfect international financial markets is restricted to a model with financial autarky, while in Corsetti et al. (2018) the analysis of imperfect financial markets is represented by a single-bond economy. These structures provide important insights into the implications of imperfect financial trade but they are obviously not a good representation of modern international financial markets.====The main objective of the current paper is to analyse optimal monetary policy in more general models of imperfect international financial trade than those considered in Corsetti et al., 2010, Corsetti et al., 2018. Our analysis begins with a simple model which adds one extra asset compared to Corsetti et al., 2010, Corsetti et al., 2018, so there is trade in two nominal bonds. Despite the additional asset our model continues to be one where financial markets are incomplete (because there are not sufficient assets to hedge against all shocks). We show that this small change in financial market structure has an important qualitative and a potentially large quantitative effect on optimal cooperative policy compared to Corsetti et al., 2010, Corsetti et al., 2018. Corsetti et al., 2010, Corsetti et al., 2018 analysis shows that optimal cooperative policy deviates from inflation targeting most significantly for small values of the international trade elasticity and when prices are set in the currency of the consumer (local currency pricing, LCP). At higher values of the trade elasticity the deviations from inflation targeting are quantitatively small. In contrast, our results show that, with international trade in two bonds, there are quantitatively large deviations from inflation targeting for a wide range of values of the trade elasticity. These large deviations arise in terms of welfare, the optimal policy rule and variances of critical variables. In particular, we show that optimal cooperative policy implies a significant stabilisation of the real exchange rate gap relative to inflation targeting.====We are further able to show that the critical difference between the single-bond case and the two-bond case arises specifically because, in the two-bond case, monetary policy is able to change portfolio returns and the composition of the equilibrium portfolio. In effect monetary policy achieves a significant amount of leverage on risk sharing through its influence on portfolio returns and portfolio allocation. This is a mechanism which does not exist in the single-bond case.====Having demonstrated the basic result in a simple model with a limited range of stochastic shocks, two nominal bonds and a very simple policy rule, we extend the analysis in a number of directions. We add further sources of shocks, we allow for trade in equities as well as nominal bonds and we consider a more general version of the policy rule. We also consider local currency pricing. We show that our basic result carries over to these more general cases.====Because our model allows for international trade in multiple assets it is obviously necessary to compute equilibrium gross portfolios. As just explained, a crucial mechanism at work in our model is that the size and composition of these portfolios depend on the properties of the monetary rule. There is therefore an interaction between policy choice and portfolio choice. Equilibrium portfolios are computed using techniques developed in recent literature (see Devereux and Sutherland, 2010a, Devereux and Sutherland, 2011a and Tille and van Wincoop (2010)). The combining of these techniques with the analysis of optimal policy is an important innovation of this paper.====The paper proceeds as follows. The model is presented in Section 2. Our definition of welfare and the characterisation of monetary policy is described in Section 3 and our methodology for deriving optimal policy rules in the presence of endogenous portfolio choice is described in Section 4. The main results of the paper are presented in Section 5 and the results from an extended version of the model are described in Section 6.

The model also provides a resolution to the Backus-Smith-Kollmann puzzle.","How much do countries share risk through international financial markets, and how large are the gains from doing so? The answers to these questions depend on how risk sharing is measured. Brandt et al. (2006) show that measures of risk sharing based on asset price data imply significant international risk sharing, while measures based on aggregate consumption data display much less risk sharing.==== As a consequence, as shown by Lewis (2000), welfare gains from risk sharing based on stock returns are higher than those based on aggregate consumption.====The discrepancy in these risk sharing measures is puzzling. In standard international macro models, consumption determines asset prices, rendering consumption-based and asset price-based measures of risk sharing identical. Resolving this puzzle involves either changing the preferences used in standard models or modifying the asset market structure, as discussed by Brandt et al. (2006), Cochrane and Santa-Clara. In this paper, we take the latter route, and evaluate the extent to which frictions that endogenously limit participation in asset markets can account for the discrepancy between the asset price-based and consumption-based measures of international risk sharing.====We analyze a two-country monetary model with international trade in assets along the lines of Alvarez et al., 2002, Alvarez et al., 2009 (henceforth AAK02 and AAK09), in which households pay heterogenous fixed costs to exchange money for interest-bearing assets. Households face idiosyncratic income shocks, and asset markets are endogenously segmented because only a fraction of households at any point in time find it beneficial to pay the fixed cost to access their assets.==== We enrich this model with real aggregate shocks and trade in goods, features which are essential for generating movements in aggregate consumption and risk sharing across countries. Indeed, without trade, consumption is constrained by domestic resources and there is no risk sharing.====Limited asset market participation leads to differences in the asset price-based and consumption-based risk sharing measures. Households that actively adjust their asset holdings share risk among each other, both within and across countries. Since these households' marginal utility growth determines asset prices, there is a high degree of international risk sharing based on asset prices. On the other hand, these households account for a time-varying fraction of aggregate consumption in each country, so measures of consumption imply a low degree of international risk sharing at the aggregate level.====We quantify this mechanism by calibrating our model to match the cross-sectional variance of household income and consumption in US data and the fraction of households actively adjusting their assets, along with the time series properties of aggregate traded and non-traded output in the US and an aggregate of 21 OECD trading partners. We compute risk sharing measures in the model based on stochastic discount factors derived from asset prices and based on aggregate consumption. The model predicts a high cross-country correlation of the equity-price based discount factors—about 0.85—and a cross-country correlation of aggregate consumption that is much lower—about 0.32. These values are in line with the empirical findings in Brandt et al. (2006). Both asset market segmentation and trade in goods are necessary to generate the discrepancy between consumption-based and asset price-based measures of risk sharing in our framework. To illustrate this, we consider two alternative market structures that eliminate, in turn, these key features. In a frictionless, complete markets model (with no asset market segmentation), the risk sharing measures are both above 0.9, reflecting relatively high risk sharing. In a segmented markets model with no trade in goods, the ordering of the risk sharing statistics is opposite: aggregate consumption reflects better risk sharing than asset prices.====In our model, underlying the difference between asset-price based and consumption-based measures of risk sharing is the prediction that active households' consumption is more highly correlated across countries than inactive households' consumption. We provide suggestive evidence for this implication using micro data from the US (the Consumer Expenditure Survey, or CEX) and the UK (the Family Expenditure Survey, or FES), showing that assetholders in the two countries have more highly correlated consumption than non-assetholders.====Our model also generates a negative correlation between the real exchange rate and the ratio of aggregate consumption across countries, offering a resolution to the Backus-Smith-Kollmann puzzle (Backus and Smith (1993), Kollmann (1995)).==== In the standard complete markets model, the ratio of two countries' aggregate consumption is perfectly correlated with the real exchange rate, but in the data this correlation is often negative (see calculations for G7 countries in Table 2). In our model, the ratio of ==== households' consumption, not aggregate consumption, is perfectly correlated with the real exchange rate. We find the correlation of relative aggregate consumption with the real exchange rate is −0.8. Traded output shocks and monetary shocks generate this negative correlation, because they move the ratios of relative aggregate consumption and relative active consumption in opposite directions. Non-traded shocks move the ratios of relative consumption in the same direction, but lead to a low cross-country correlation in aggregate consumption.====A version of our model with an exogenous division of active and inactive households yields both a negative consumption-real exchange rate correlation (as also shown in Kollmann (2012)) and a discrepancy between asset-price based and consumption-based risk sharing measures, but our model with endogenously segmented markets has additional important implications. In particular, the fraction of households actively participating varies over time in response to shocks that change the incentive to participate. One implication is that endogenous movements in the fraction of inactive households and their average income actually reinforce risk sharing and slightly raise the consumption-real exchange rate correlation. A related cross-sectional implication is that higher average inflation in our model is associated with more frequent asset market activity, as inflation reduces the value of inactive households' income, leading to better international risk sharing. Using data for 86 countries, we document that average inflation is strongly positively associated with the correlation between the real exchange rate and consumption relative to the US. Our model with endogenous segmentation is consistent with this fact, while the exogenously segmented model is not.====Given that our benchmark model can address the discrepancy between the asset-price based and consumption-based measures of risk sharing, we employ it to evaluate the welfare effects of access to international financial markets. We construct alternative measures of welfare gains relative to financial autarky based on actual ex ante average utility across households, utility of aggregate consumption, or utility of active households' consumption. We find that active consumption-based welfare gains are significantly larger compared to aggregate consumption-based gains, consistent with Lewis (2000)’s findings that asset prices imply higher welfare gains than aggregate consumption. With a coefficient of relative risk aversion of two, the welfare gain measured from active consumption is an order of magnitude larger than the gain measured from aggregate consumption.====Other papers that explain the discrepancy between consumption-based and asset price-based measures of risk sharing include Colacito and Croce (2011) and Lewis and Liu (2015). In these papers, Epstein-Zin preferences and long-run consumption risk result in a separation between asset prices and contemporaneous aggregate consumption levels, which generates cross-country asset price correlations that are larger than consumption correlations. We complement these papers by evaluating how much we can explain with standard time-separable preferences and a single asset market friction—segmented markets due to fixed costs—with otherwise complete asset markets.====Our use of an endogenously segmented asset markets model with heterogeneous households to study international risk sharing is novel.==== AAK02 and AAK09 both analyze a two-country model with only non-traded goods and monetary shocks, and their focus is on interest rates and exchange rates, while aggregate consumption is essentially constant due to the absence of real shocks. Both papers conjecture that segmented asset markets can explain the Backus-Smith-Kollmann puzzle, but do not explore the implications of their model for consumption. In contrast to these papers, our model has real shocks and trade in goods to allow for movements in aggregate consumption and international risk sharing. In an appendix, AAK09 consider an extension with traded goods, but no real shocks.====In addition to the exogenously segmented market model in Kollmann (2012), other work that incorporates household heterogeneity to address international risk sharing and the Backus-Smith-Kollmann puzzle includes Sungur (2004), and Kocherlakota and Pistaferri (2007).==== Sungur finds support for the AAK02 model's relationship between the real exchange rate and active households' consumption in Italian regional data. Kocherlakota and Pistaferri test the implications of a model with private information using US and UK survey data and show that the ratio of higher moments of the consumption distribution across countries is linked to the real exchange rate.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section2 presents our benchmark segmented asset markets model with traded and non-traded goods and characterizes equilibrium. Section3 contains all the quantitative analysis, including results on measures of international risk sharing and welfare gains from financial markets.

Following the public choice approach to political economy (Mueller, 2003; Besley, 2006), we model the sovereign as a provider of public goods subject to an agency cost, namely, that the sovereign derives private benefits from public office. Among the many ramifications of this approach, we focus on the following: If tenure as a leader is expected to be short, the anticipated loss of private benefits will make the sovereign behave myopically and, furthermore, political turnover, when it is linked to economic malperformance of the country, can contribute significantly to fluctuations in sovereign default risk.====Regarding political turnover we are guided by the evidence presented in Brender and Drazen (2008) who show that, for developing countries that elect their leaders, there is a strong positive link between the rate of economic growth during a leader's term and the likelihood of his or her reelection. Specifically, they document that a 1 percentage point increase in the rate of GDP growth during the leader's term is associated with a 6–9 percentage point increase in the probability of his or her reelection.====In this paper, we provide a model of elections that endogenizes political turnover and ties the electoral success of incumbent government to economic outcomes, consistent with the Brender-Drazen findings. For this purpose, we model the parameters of the economy's growth process as switching over time according to a (hidden) two-state Markov process as in Hamilton (1989). For the three countries we study —namely, Mexico, Peru and Turkey— this process is a better description of the growth data than the single-regime AR1 process commonly used in the sovereign debt literature. To incorporate the evidence on the positive link between economic growth and reelection, we assume that when a new leader is elected the economy's growth regime is newly drawn from a given distribution. This has the implication that voters are more likely to replace the incumbent leader if they perceive that they have a better shot at the good growth regime with a new leader.====Endogenous political turnover links the sovereign's effective discount factor positively to economic performance. When economic growth is strong, the incumbent leader's chances of reelection are high, which extends the leader's planning horizon, causes him or her to borrow less, and therefore, causes spreads to fall. Consistent with this, observed spreads are negatively correlated with the estimated probability of being in the better of the two growth regimes in all three economies. When the model is calibrated to target the average external debt-to-GDP ratio, average spreads, and the observed magnitude of the sensitivity of reelection probability to economic growth, this effect is predicted to be quantitatively strong — the standard deviation of spreads is an order of magnitude larger than in standard models, or models with exogenous political turnover, and close to observed spread volatilities.====Our finding that endogenous political turnover can contribute to volatility of sovereign spreads is noteworthy. Quantitative versions of the Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) model typically require the sovereign to have a low discount factor and the sovereign's optimal policy then is to borrow all the way to the point where the default risk is just high enough to balance the sovereign's desire for current expenditure. In this situation, shocks to fundamentals — absent default — translate rather quickly into changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio that leaves default risk essentially unchanged. It is as if the sovereign has a target level of default risk and manages his borrowings to attain that target closely. Hence, equilibrium spread volatility is very low. However, this changes when the effective discount factor gets linked to economic performance: Now, it is as if the target default risk itself moves with economic growth — falling when economic growth is positive and stable, and rising when it is negative and volatile. These fluctuations in the target default risk generate fluctuations in sovereign spreads.====The political economy implications of spread volatility developed in this paper is complementary to other volatility-elevating channels proposed in the literature. The simplest approach is to posit that default costs, as a proportion of output, increases with output; such a nonlinear default cost structure implies low (high) spreads when output is above (below) trend, and results in higher equilibrium spread volatility (Arellano, 2008 and Chatterjee and Eyigungor, 2012). As shown in Mendoza and Yue (2012), a cost structure of this type can be rationalized in a model in which access to working capital loans is more valuable when TFP is above-trend. In Yue (2010), renegotiation of debt following default implies more debt repayment when output is high, delivering a rising ==== default cost in good times and, therefore, more spread volatility. Finally, as shown in Aguiar et al. (2017), nonfundamental shocks — in the form of low-probability rollover crises — can be a significant source of spread volatility, quite independent of the structure of true or effective default costs. Our approach is complementary in that we microfound the required short-termism of the sovereign via a model of politics and show that endogenous political turnover can also be a source of spread volatility.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses connections to the main existing studies related to ours. Section 3 presents some facts regarding growth regimes and their correlation with spreads. Section 4 lays out the environment, taking some care to explain the novel elements of the model. Endogenous turnover, diversions and the effective discount factor are covered in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the calibration of the model and Section 7 presents the findings.

Anticipated shocks are identified as the expected change in the Fed Funds rate orthogonal to expected U.S. business cycle conditions while unanticipated shocks are the one-step ahead forecast error. Anticipated shocks explain around half of the narrative series of U.S. ==== shocks. To identify the effects of both shocks, I estimate a Panel ==== using a sample of emerging economies. An anticipated 25 basis points contractionary U.S. ","Over the last decades most emerging economies have increasingly opened their borders to financial flows. This integration has improved their access to international financial markets and substantially increased their interdependencies with developed economies. In this context, movements in the international interest rate have been identified as an important source of business cycle fluctuations in emerging economies. Fluctuations in the international interest rate may affect borrowing conditions, commodity prices, exchange rates, flows of capital, and the macroeconomic conditions of emerging economies. Although this topic has been widely studied, there is no consensus on the macroeconomic effects of variations in the U.S. interest rate on these economies.==== Understanding the transmission of U.S. interest rate shocks is crucial not only for explaining business cycle fluctuations in emerging economies but also for designing monetary and macroprudential policies.====A common feature of previous empirical works is that they abstract from potential anticipation effects. However, many movements in the U.S. interest rate are anticipated by the market before they occur. A potential source of monetary anticipation is the practice of “forward guidance” through which the Central Bank informs the future course of monetary policy. Moreover, the Fed Funds Future contracts provide a market-based unbiased expectations indicator of interest rate's evolution (Owens and Webb, 2001; Hamilton, 2009). Capital flows, financial markets, and exchange rates may react to an expected movement before any change in the U.S. interest rate. Hansen and Sargent (1991) demonstrate that, in the case of anticipation, a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) with insufficient information (i.e. without considering agents' expectations) fails to capture the true dynamics of the variables. This fact may explain the lack of consensus from previous works about the effects of U.S. interest rate shocks on emerging economies.====This paper develops a novel way of identifying anticipated (news) and unanticipated (surprise) U.S. interest rate shocks and assesses their propagation to emerging economies. To identify both shocks, I exploit the different maturities of the Fed Funds Future contracts. First, I compute the anticipated change of the Fed Funds rate between two consecutive quarters and show that it accounts for 80% of the realized Fed Funds fluctuations. Analogously, the unanticipated change is defined as the one-step ahead forecast error. Then, assuming that the Federal Reserve follows a Taylor rule, I purge the anticipated and unanticipated policy movements of systematic policy changes which relate to current and expected U.S. business cycle conditions. One of the main advantages of this identification strategy is that the identified shocks do not rely on the ordering or on the response of U.S. variables. The identified series of anticipated shocks contains important information to predict the narrative monetary policy shocks of Romer and Romer (2004), updated by Tenreyro and Thwaites (2016).====Using a quarterly sample of emerging economies, I estimate a Panel VAR to identify the effects of the previously identified anticipated and unanticipated shocks on macroeconomic aggregates of emerging economies. The model assumes that these economies are small open economies, which implies that they do not influence the Fed Funds rate. The baseline specification includes international variables (terms of trade and an indicator of global financial conditions), the main macroeconomic variables (GDP, Investment, Trade Balance, CPI inflation, the exchange rate depreciation, and the country interest rate), cross-border bank credit, and the borrowing-lending spread. I incorporate the anticipated and unanticipated U.S. interest rate shocks in an exogenous block. Results show that emerging economies react once they receive the news about the future evolution of the Fed Funds, even before the rate changes. In particular, a two-quarter ahead expected 25 basis points increase of the U.S. interest rate induces a fall of 0.5% in GDP from its linear trend, two quarters before the shock materializes. Unanticipated contractionary interest rate shocks also cause a similar contraction in emerging economies but after the change in the U.S. interest rate. Allowing for the response of the U.S. BAA corporate spread to these shocks is important for explaining the observed output and investment responses, accounting for 42% of the total effect. After accounting for anticipation, U.S. interest rate shocks explain around 14% of output fluctuations in emerging economies.====The international macroeconomics literature has so far assessed the propagation of U.S. monetary policy to emerging economies without reaching a conclusive evidence. On the one hand, Canova (2005) and Ilzetzki and Jin (2013), using different identification schemes, find that a contractionary shock induces an increase in the domestic interest rate, a depreciation of the exchange rate, and a delayed positive effect on economic activity emerging economies after 1990. On the other hand, Uribe and Yue (2006) estimate the effects of changes in the U.S. real interest rate and find that an increase in this rate induces a contraction of GDP in emerging economies. Mackowiak (2007), Dedola et al. (2017) and Iacoviello and Navarro (forthcoming) show that U.S. monetary policy shocks induce heterogeneous effects on real activity. In this paper, I show that anticipation is key to understand the effects of U.S. interest rate shocks and that a contractionary U.S. interest rate shock induces a decline in output on emerging economies. The response of the U.S. BAA corporate spread significantly amplifies the response of emerging economies to both shocks.====Sharp declines in capital inflows, called Sudden Stops, have been considered a major concern for emerging economies (see, for example, Calvo et al., 2006). Usually, they induce immediate output collapses and severely affect the banking sector. The transmission channels and macroeconomic effects identified in this paper are consistent with the findings in this literature (see, for example, Chari et al., 2005; Kehoe and Ruhl, 2009). More recently, Rey (2013) and Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2018) show that capital flows, especially credit flows, are largely driven by a ====, which is determined by monetary conditions and by changes in risk aversion and uncertainty. Akinci (2013) shows that the effect of global financial conditions in emerging economies is largely driven by risk aversion, proxied by the U.S. BAA corporate spread, while changes in the U.S. interest rate account for a negligible part of business cycles fluctuations in these economies. Anticipated and unanticipated U.S. interest rate shocks may be key determinants of the ==== since they induce large declines in cross-border bank credit and increases in sovereign spread. In fact, both shocks explain a significant fraction of U.S. BAA corporate spread fluctuations.====There has been a renewed interest in the effects of news shocks, understood as shocks that are observed before they materialize (Beaudry and Portier, 2006). Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2012) show that anticipated shocks account for half of the predicted aggregate macroeconomic fluctuations. Following this line, many papers have tried to disentangle the effects of news shocks on different macroeconomic variables. For example, in an open economy framework, Ben Zeev et al. (2017) highlight the role of terms of trade news shocks to account for business cycles fluctuations in emerging economies. Regarding monetary policy, previous studies have analyzed the effects of anticipated shocks to the interest rate rule in a closed-economy. Estimating DSGE models, Milani and Treadwell (2012) and Gomes et al. (2013) find that anticipated (news) shocks in monetary policy are more important than unanticipated (surprise) ones to explain U.S. output fluctuations. Ben Zeev et al. (2016) find that a significant fraction of the U.S. interest rate rule residuals is anticipated by the private sector. This paper shows that anticipated U.S. interest rate shocks have significant effects on emerging economies.====The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the identification and properties of news and surprise U.S. interest rate shocks and compares them with the narrative series of monetary policy shocks. Section 3 characterizes the empirical strategy used to identify the macroeconomic effects of both types of shocks on emerging economies and presents the empirical results. Section 4 reports the results from additional robustness exercises and extensions. Finally, Section 5 concludes.",Monetary news in the United States and business cycles in emerging economies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618304483,March 2019,2019,Research Article,269.0

We show that the combination of income risk and the ==== motive leads to both more procyclical capital outflows in the shorter run and a higher long-run external asset position.,"A robust stylized fact established in the literature on international capital flows is that the current account and the trade balance are on average countercyclical. That is, times of relatively high output growth in a country are typically also times when the trade balance turns negative and there are net capital flows into the country. The standard real open-economy model of the business cycle can replicate this phenomenon when output growth is sufficiently positively autocorrelated, because optimizing households' desire to smooth consumption causes them to borrow against the expected further increases in income.==== Consequently, we should expect a negative relationship between output growth and capital outflows over the business cycle.====In this paper, we uncover a new dimension to this pattern: data from the Penn World Tables on 119 developing, emerging, and developed countries reveal that for countries with a relatively high volatility of output growth, the trade balance and the current account tend to be less countercyclical. In other words, the more unstable the growth rate of output, the more a country responds to favorable output shocks by importing on net relatively less capital and goods than more stable countries. For countries with very volatile output growth, the correlation between output growth and capital outflows is even likely to be positive.==== This relationship is robust to the inclusion of a range of factors that may affect the cyclicality of the current account, such as political stability, the diversification of a country's productive structure, its access to international financial markets, or its trade openness.====Our finding is closely related to the empirical observation found in a recent literature that the net foreign asset position of a country is increasing with aggregate uncertainty, an effect which is also present in our data set. This can be justified as an increase of precautionary savings in the presence of a higher volatility of income. Thus, at the aggregate level, a more volatile growth rate of output increases national savings as households aim at self-insuring against possible negative income shocks, which manifests itself in an increase in the net foreign asset position. This dependence emerges from OECD data for industrialized countries, as documented by Fogli and Perri (2015).==== Our paper generalizes their work by including developing and emerging markets and adds to their findings by uncovering an effect of macroeconomic uncertainty on the cyclicality of net foreign assets.====For a structural interpretation of the relationship between output volatility and the cyclicality of external assets, we present a simple model of a small open economy where the growth rate of productivity is stochastic. We take explicit account of the precautionary savings motive, which becomes relevant when asset markets are incomplete. One key challenge to solve such a model is that it has no deterministic steady state, which rules out linear approximations and the application of standard methods for finding rational expectations equilibria. To include economic agents' precautionary asset accumulation in reaction to uncertainty, second-order effects must be taken into account. To this end, we apply an algorithm developed by Den Haan et al. (2016). It uses the contemporaneous non-linear equilibrium conditions and merely approximates the expected behavior of the economy around the contemporaneous state variables. While computationally much less demanding compared to the exact solution based on projection methods, den Haan et al. show this approach to be very accurate.====We show that under a fairly conventional calibration, simulation of the model generates qualitatively the patterns consistent with the stylized fact reported above. Increasing the volatility of output growth in the range found in the data, the cyclicality of the current account rises and turns from negative for low volatilities to positive for high volatilities. Effectively, precautionary savings raise households' discount factor, tilting incentives to move consumption into the future. In line with the precautionary savings motive in consumer theory, we thus confirm an effect similar to what Van der Ploeg (1993) calls ‘making hay while the sun shines’, which depends on the average volatility of income. The less certain the good times are, the more consumers take advantage of favorable shocks to prepare for bad times. For an open economy, this implies a procyclical current account when output volatility is high. The model also generates a non-linearity that appears to be present in the data: for low volatilities, the marginal effect of output volatility on the cyclicality of external balances seems to be weak, but is stronger for high volatilities.====Our paper thus adds a new dimension to the understanding of capital flows as driven by precautionary savings: a dependence of the cyclicality of the current account on the average volatility of output. The focus on precautionary savings in international macroeconomics is relatively recent, while it has been a classic topic in the consumption literature, as exemplified by the quote of van der Ploeg above. In the macroeconomics literature, this focus is part of a quest to explain global imbalances and international capital flows, which goes back at least to the seminal paper of Lucas (1990), who documents that capital does not flow from rich to poor countries, which ostensibly have higher marginal products of capital. Leading explanations of this so-called Lucas Paradox are differences in the production structure of an economy, capital market imperfections, and the quality of institutions.====Gourinchas and Jeanne (2013) add an allocation puzzle to the list of anomalies, according to which capital flows from fast to slow growing countries, while, in the present-value model of the current account, the opposite ought to take place.====Explicitly referring to the precautionary savings motive to explain net foreign asset positions are Carroll and Jeanne (2009), even though their focus is on idiosyncratic unemployment risk for the explanation of net foreign assets. Similarly, Angeletos and Panousi (2011) assess how uninsurable idiosyncratic entrepreneurial risk impacts on capital accumulation and current account dynamics. The authors show how cross-country differences in premia for this risk can help to explain the persistence of income inequality across countries. Also Corneli (2009) analyses how idiosyncratic risk in entrepreneurial activities, which can only be partially hedged, results in oversaving and too little investment in the economy, relative to the efficient allocation. Capital account liberalization can then produce an outflow of capital in search for safe investment, with the consequence of reducing investment further.====More closely related to our paper is Sandri (2014), who shows that the response of entrepreneurs to higher productivity growth tends to cause current account improvements. This is driven by firms that face idiosyncratic risk and that need to self-finance investment, which leads them to raise savings more than investment in relatively good times, due to a precautionary motive. Thus, in his model, the current account is procyclical. Only in countries that share a similar depth of financial markets as the U.S. would the current account turn out countercyclical, because entrepreneurs can rely on external finance. Instead, our study relies on the role of household savings in generating a procyclicality in the current account and shows that this relationship crucially depends on the average degree of macroeconomic uncertainty that agents face.====As mentioned, Fogli and Perri (2015) is closely related to our work. They focus on the variation over time of macroeconomic uncertainty and find for OECD data that changes in output volatility lead to medium- to long-run changes in net foreign assets of the same sign. They quantitatively explain this dependence in their simulation of a two-country real business cycle model with a time-varying volatility of shocks to the level of productivity. Up to a third of the observed net foreign asset positions can be explained by the precautionary savings motive in their model, contributing to the understanding of global imbalances. However, because of assumed shocks that affect only the level of productivity and not its growth rate, their model would invariably generate a current account that is procyclical in the short-run, irrespective of the volatility of growth, in contrast to the findings in our paper. The paper by Coeurdacier et al. (2011) also aims at explaining net foreign asset position with a precautionary savings motive.====Other research has focused on specific aspects of precautionary savings in the open economy. Durdu et al. (2009) assess the optimal level of precautionary assets of a small open economy in response to business cycle volatility and the risk of a sudden stop. They conclude that these risks are plausible explanations of the observed surge in foreign exchange reserves in emerging market countries.==== Also, Jeanne and Rancière (2011) show that high levels of international reserves for emerging markets can be explained by the attempt to insure against costly sudden stops.==== Gourio et al. (2014) find a relationship between stock market volatility and external balances, where the stock market can be seen as an indicator of macroeconomic uncertainty. Their particular focus is on the behavior of international investors, who respond to higher expropriation risks by withdrawing capital in times of weak economic growth in a country.====As most papers in the literature on international business cycles, and all the papers cited above, we assume that international asset markets are incomplete. Otherwise, agents could completely insure themselves against consumption risk, and would not need to build up wealth for precautionary motives. In fact, Corsetti et al. (2008) show that standard international business cycle models can be reconciled with the empirical evidence on the lack of consumption risk sharing when asset markets are incomplete, that is, when households trade international bonds only.====The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we investigate in the data the cyclicality of the current account and its dependence on macroeconomic volatility and establish our main empirical result. Section 3 develops a small-open economy real business cycle model with a stochastic productivity growth rate to understand how uncertainty leads to precautionary savings and how rising uncertainty can change the sign of the cyclicality of the current account. Section 4 discusses our results in the broader context of the literature and Section 5 concludes.","International capital flows, external assets and output volatility",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618304513,March 2019,2019,Research Article,270.0

The results show that temporary import tariffs are beneficial to the least productive “good” EU producers, but harms the most productive “ugly” EU importers. Overall, the net effects of anti-dumping policy on European employment and exports are largely negative. Also tariffs enhance the productivity of surviving “bad” Chinese exporters and widens the productivity gap with European competitors.","The “China Shock” associated with the emergence of China as the “factory of the world” and the world's top exporter of goods has had significant implications for economies across the globe, especially in developed countries (WTO, 2015; Autor et al., 2016b; Baldwin, 2016; Qiu and Zhan, 2016). Import competition from China and other low-wage countries has been linked to plant closure, lower firm-level growth and negative employment and wage effects at the industry and local labor market levels.====China's rise as a global economic power and the resulting turmoil in developed countries' labor markets led to a significant shift toward protectionism, mainly through the adoption of anti-dumping (AD) and anti-subsidy measures, which are some of the few trade defense instruments allowed under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework (Feigenbaum and Hall, 2015).==== The use of AD measures has been on the rise, especially since the 2008 financial crisis. As the world's largest exporter, China has been the main target of a significant share of these AD measures, especially from the United States (U.S.) and the European Union (EU). Between 1995 and 2014, of a total of 3058 AD cases, China has been the target of 759 (almost 25% of the total), and since 2008 China's share in AD measures has increased to around 40%.====Although international trade policy measures such as AD duties aim to protect domestic industries, they often result in higher prices for consumers, and increase the costs of import-dependent firms impacting their exporting capability (Irwin, 2017). In addition, these measures constrain the ability of import-dependent firms to access cheaper or higher-quality intermediate inputs from foreign markets, with negative implications for their position in the global value chains of production and for their productivity more generally (Konings and Vandenbussche, 2013; Vandenbussche and Viegelahn, 2018).====The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effects of the EU's AD policy on Chinese imports between 1999 and 2007 and to provide a comprehensive economic analysis of its implications on the performance of all categories of affected firms. We consider France as a representative EU country and combine firm-level and international trade transaction-level data from France and China to study the implications of AD measures on the total factor productivity (TFP), employment, total exports and investment in research and development (R&D) of all affected firms. Following the European political narrative, these include “the good” import-competingEuropean producers facing unfair import competition, defined as French producers that belong to 4-digit manufacturing sectors that are protected by the EU AD measures (Konings and Vandenbussche, 2008; Pierce, 2011); “the bad” Chinese firms that export to the EU the products targeted by the AD measures and “the ugly” European import-dependent firms that we define as the French manufacturing firms that import from China products that were targeted by the AD measures. We identify 36 AD cases approved by the EU and targeting Chinese imports between 1999 and 2007. These cases are linked to almost 700 “ugly,” 2000 “good” and 2780 “bad” firms.==== Our methodological approach is to apply a difference-in-differences (DID) methodology combined with a propensity score matching (PSM) approach to control for selection-bias issues (Konings and Vandenbussche, 2008; Pierce, 2011).====The availability of rich, firm-level data for French manufacturing firms allows the identification of producers and importers of protected products and the construction of various measures of firm-level performance. Moreover, several studies have highlighted the similarities among European firms, particularly in terms of the link between internationalization strategies and firm-level performance (Ottaviano and Mayer, 2007; Rubini, 2010; Bekes et al., 2011). Hence, our contribution is twofold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a comprehensive micro-level analysis of the effects of the AD measures on the performance of foreign exporters, domestic producers and domestic importers of the targeted products. Second, we precisely identify import-dependent firms that rely on the import of products affected by AD duties and therefore consider the implications of these duties on their performance.====To briefly summarize our results, our findings suggest that the EU AD policy is successful in constraining Chinese exports to the EU, mainly through a reduction in the number of Chinese exporters. Protected import-competing firms enjoy an improvement in productivity and employment, but these positive effects are limited to the least productive firms, mainly those that do not export outside the European Single Market. However, the same AD measures have a negative effect on the productivity, employment, and total exports of import-dependent firms, particularly the most productive. These negative effects are not limited to firms that import the products directly from China, but extend to firms that may import the products from other source countries, since the prices of these products tend to rise in general. Although the EU AD duties lead to the exit of some Chinese exporters, the surviving ones experience an increase in productivity, employment and total exports. The improved performance of the surviving exporters seems to be driven by investments in R&D, which allow exporters to improve productivity and overcome the rise in trade costs induced by the AD measures.====The overall effect of these policies is perverse. First, we find the general impact on the French economy to be mixed. The imposition of the AD measures leads to a deterioration in the productivity of import-dependent firms, although it increases that of import-competing firms. However, the costs in terms of productivity appear to be experienced mainly by highly productive import-dependent firms, while the benefits are captured by less productive import-competing ones. The overall protection effect in terms of employment is negative: the larger negative impact on a few import-dependent firms causes the loss of almost 13,000 jobs, much more than the almost 1400 new jobs created by protected import-competing firms. Moreover, by increasing the cost of sourcing inputs from China, the AD policy reduces the exports of import-dependent firms by almost 9 billion euros. If we take into account of all potential users of targeted Chinese products and extend our calculations to the overall French economy, the net loss is of almost 81,000 jobs and 42 billion euros in terms of exports, which accounts for almost 2.2% of the overall employment in and 13% of the overall exports from French manufacturing industries. Finally, by improving the performance of surviving Chinese exporters, the EU AD policy leads to a perverse long-run effect that widens the productivity gap between French firms and competing Chinese exporters.====These findings have important economic and policy implications. First, we demonstrate the inefficiency of AD duties as an instrument of trade protection. The imposition of AD tariffs manages to protect the “good” import-competing firms only in the short run, while the upscaling of the surviving “bad” Chinese exporters leads to even tougher competitive pressures in the long run. Second, amid growing concern about the protectionist abuse of these measures, governments in developed countries should take into account the likely negative impact of AD duties on “ugly” import-dependent firms. These firms are highly productive and fully integrated in the global value chains of production. They import intermediate inputs from China because of their higher “value-for-money” ratio to produce better and high-end products, generating growth in value added and local employment.====This paper contributes to several strands of the literature, especially the literatures on the implications of trade defense instruments and access to imported inputs for firm-level performance. The theoretical literature on AD predicts, in general, that AD policies are, in most cases, welfare reducing. In terms of welfare, the gains for protected producers are more than offset by the costs in terms of consumers welfare and loss of comparative advantage (Gallaway et al., 1999; Blonigen and Park, 2004; Bown and Crowley, 2007; Ruhl, 2014; Wu et al., 2014). From an empirical standpoint, several studies have shown that AD measures have a negative impact on trade volumes, due to the effects associated with trade destruction, diversion and deflection (Bown and Crowley, 2006; Durling and Prusa, 2006; Vandenbussche and Zanardi, 2010; Egger and Nelson, 2011; Besedes and Prusa, 2017).====Despite using different methods and data sources, existing micro-level empirical studies find similar results to our own on import-competing firms. For instance, previous firm-level analyses have congruently shown that protection through AD measures results in an improvement in the markup of protected firms (Konings and Vandenbussche, 2005; Pierce, 2011), consistent with the theoretical prediction of a pro-competitive effect of trade, where trade induces greater competition that leads to a fall in the prices and markups of domestic firms (Melitz and Ottaviano, 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Edmond et al., 2015; Arkolakis et al., 2018). In terms of productivity, Konings and Vandenbussche (2008), using a revenue-based measure of productivity, find a positive effect on the productivity of protected firms. Pierce (2011) instead, measuring productivity based on physical output and getting rid of the output price bias, provides evidence of a negative productivity effect for U.S. firms. However, in line with our results, both studies show how the effects of AD measures are heterogeneous across firms and tend to benefit laggard import-competing firms. Similarly, in line with our results, evidence by Lu et al. (2013) on the effect of U.S. AD duties against Chinese products on the performance of affected Chinese exporters, show that such protectionist measures make the surviving exporters more productive. In turn, this will increase the competitive pressures faced by protected firms in developed countries once the AD duties are lifted, sowing doubts about the efficiency of these measures to protect threatened industries. We contribute to this literature by analyzing the combined impact of the same AD measures on the two competing groups of firms, the “good” European domestic producers and the “bad” Chinese exporters.====So far, however, only few papers have considered the implications of AD measures on import-dependent firms, which are increasingly prominent in today's world of vertical specialization and production fragmentation across borders. Anecdotal evidence documented by Isakson (2007) and Eckhardt (2011) shows how import-dependent firms lose from the imposition of AD duties and often oppose their implementation.==== The reason is that access to imported inputs can enhance the productivity of domestic firms by increasing the range of available intermediate inputs, by improving the quality of available inputs and through learning-by-importing effects (Ethier, 1982; Markusen, 1989; Grossman and Helpman, 1991; Kasahara and Rodrigue, 2008).==== Moreover, access to imports from low-cost countries can improve the competitiveness of firms by reducing production costs and generating savings that may allow firms to expand their domestic activities (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg, 2008). In an attempt to take these firms into consideration, Konings and Vandenbussche (2013) build a model where AD duties are imposed on intermediate goods and show that the overall effect of these duties on the output of an importer depends on the elasticity of demand. A higher elasticity of demand will lead to larger losses from protection. Although Konings and Vandenbussche (2013) are unable to identify importers, they consider exporting firms instead and assume that exporters of a product are more likely to be importers as well. They also assume that exporters face tougher competition in international markets; therefore, compared with domestic sales, the foreign sales of an exporting firm will be more strongly affected by protectionism. Their results show that AD policies harm exporters while benefiting domestic producers.====The closest paper to our study is by Vandenbussche and Viegelahn (2018), who look at the within-firm reallocation of inputs as a result of AD policy in India. Firms using products affected by AD measures readjust their input mix and reduce the use of protected inputs. As a result, import-dependent firms reallocate their sales away from outputs made of protected inputs and experience a reduction in their markups. Vandenbussche and Viegelahn (2018) identify users of protected inputs but are unable to distinguish between firms that import those inputs from targeted countries and those that source the protected inputs domestically or from unaffected foreign locations. By using detailed transaction-level data on imports, our paper is the first to identify precisely import-dependent firms. We track French firms that have imported from China the products affected by EU AD measures against China before and after the imposition of these measures. In addition, we further contribute to the literature by exploring the heterogeneity of the response of import-dependent firms to the imposition of AD measures by considering different categories of “ugly” firms in several robustness tests.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section2 describes the data sources and presents descriptive statistics. Section3 details the methodology and Section 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings and policy implications.

We find that variation in the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution helps rationalize puzzling features of import fluctuations and that this mechanism is quantitatively important during both normal and crisis times.","Standard trade models have difficulties explaining the response of trade volumes to changes in economic activity during both normal and crisis episodes.==== For instance, the empirical elasticity of imports to measures of economic output is well above one, yet standard models imply a unitary income elasticity. Similarly, while the empirical elasticity of import volumes to measures of relative prices is well below one, typical calibrations use values that are well above one. Moreover, accounting exercises that use static trade models to measure deviations between predicted and observed fluctuations in imports find these deviations to be pro-cyclical.====This paper quantitatively explores the idea that variation in the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution can help account for these puzzling features of cyclical fluctuations of international trade volumes. The idea follows from two natural ingredients. First, time-to-ship and upfront payment frictions make the importing decision dynamic because resources today must be sacrificed for the delivery of goods tomorrow. Motivating the time-to-ship friction are previous studies which document that international trade transactions involve nontrivial time lags between the order and delivery of goods; previous studies also show that a nontrivial fraction of imports are paid before delivery, motivating the upfront payment frictions.====Second, with a finite intertemporal elasticity of substitution, the rate at which agents are willing to substitute across time—the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution—depends on the trade-off between consumption today versus expectations of consumption tomorrow. Together, these ingredients lead to the insight that variation in the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution breaks the unitary income elasticity, biases the estimated price elasticity, and shows up as a time-varying trade friction.====Our analysis proceeds in several steps. First, we outline the key facts behind fluctuations in trade volumes. While these results are not entirely new, we extend previous results from the literature to control for alternative mechanisms that we abstract from. Furthermore, these results provide the foundation for our quantitative analysis.====Second, we develop a relatively standard small open economy model. A country specializes in the production of a given good, and imports a good of a different type from the rest of the world. Domestic and imported goods are aggregated to produce a final good used for consumption and investment, and the aggregator of the goods is of the constant elasticity of substitution class. Agents take prices as given, and we model the evolution of relative prices and aggregate productivity as following a joint stochastic process. The key departure of our model from otherwise standard frameworks is that agents must commit resources today for the delivery of imported goods in the following period.====Third, we characterize the income and price elasticities in a special case of our model. We show that our model can predict an income elasticity of imports higher than unity and a price elasticity imports lower the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods. Moreover, these results motivate our calibration strategy by showing how the income and price elasticities of imports depend on the stochastic process of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution.====Fourth, we quantify the model to assess the importance of this mechanism. The three key aspects of the calibration are how we discipline the behavior of the stochastic discount factor, the time-lag in imports, and the stochastic process that governs the dynamics of productivity and prices. Our approach to disciplining the stochastic discount factor follows Cooper and Willis (2015) and infers the fluctuations in the stochastic discount factor that are attributable to the state variables of our model from data on asset returns. To discipline the dynamics of the stochastic discount factor we study an economy with external habits as in Campbell and Cochrane (1999); we calibrate the preference parameters such that the model matches properties of the estimated stochastic discount factor. Our approach to disciplining the time-lag in imports is to allow a fraction of imports to arrive within the period, and the remaining fraction to arrive with delay. We then calibrate the fraction that arrive with delay to match the average shipping time in U.S. data. Finally, we estimate the joint process for productivity and prices to match salient features of the joint dynamics of prices and absorption observed in U.S. data.====Given the calibrated model, we first study the income and price elasticities implied by the model. To compute these measures, we simulate the model and estimate the model-implied income and price elasticities using simulated data, following the same approach that we use with real data. We find that the model can quantitatively account, to a large extent, for the high income elasticity and low price elasticity observed in U.S. time series data. Specifically, the implied income elasticity is 1.25 v.s. 1.63 in the data; the implied price elasticity is −0.30 in the model and the data even though the structural elasticity of substitution is −1.30. Performing the same exercise, but removing the time-to-ship friction, we find the estimated income elasticity is effectively one and the price elasticity is the same as our calibrated elasticity of substitution.====We then investigate the model's ability to account for the actual time series of U.S. imports. To do so, we apply the Kalman smoother to compute our model's predicted import series given observed data on absorption and prices, and compare it with data. We find that our model accounts well for the dynamics in U.S. imports by correctly capturing the overall magnitude and timing of cyclical fluctuations (see Fig. 3(a).) In particular, the model accounts for a large share of the trade collapse of 2008–2009.====Fifth, we illustrate some key ingredients to our quantitative results. One important ingredient is having the model account for the observed dynamics of the stochastic discount factor. Habits and capital adjustment costs are key tools that allow our model to generate fluctuations in the stochastic discount factor and, in turn, deliver high income elasticities and low price elasticities. Another key ingredient to our findings is the existence of a mismatch between the timing of import payments and import deliveries such that a fraction of imports are paid before delivery. Third, we show that estimating the joint process for productivity and prices to match features of the dynamics of absorption and prices in the U.S. is also key to our results; our model implies income and price elasticities close to a static model under alternative parameterizations of the stochastic process. Finally, we also show that a two-country version of our model with endogenous prices implies counter-factual dynamics of absorption and prices and, thus, income and price elasticities close to a static model.====We conclude by providing evidence in support of the mechanism by examining some of the cross-sectional implications of our model. In particular, our model predicts that a country's bilateral imports should be more volatile when sourced from a partner with longer shipping times. This implication is a test of our model because static trade models predict that the volatility of imports is independent of time-to-ship and distance. Using data on shipping times constructed by Hummels and Schaur (2013) and the World Bank, we find that U.S. imports from countries with higher than average shipping times are considerably more volatile than imports from countries with lower than average shipping times. Our model is consistent with this evidence; we find these results to be supportive of the underlying mechanism at work.",International trade and intertemporal substitution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618304434,March 2019,2019,Research Article,272.0

In this paper, we analyze this question by examining the outcomes of ","With the continuous rise in the number of intellectual property rights (IPR) lawsuits and associated damage awards worldwide, there is a pronounced trend for firms involved in cross-border litigations to file complaints with, and often receive favor from, a home country jurisdiction. In the recent legal battles over intellectual property between the U.S.-based Apple Inc. (Apple) and the South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co. (Samsung), Apple sued Samsung for patent infringements over design and technology of its mobile devices in several countries, and the outcomes varied substantially across different jurisdictions. The U.S. court ruled in favor of the U.S. firm and on August 24, 2012 awarded Apple over a billion dollars in damages.==== However, when Apple filed the same case to the Seoul Central District Court in South Korea, six out of seven claims were dismissed, and no compensatory damage was awarded to Apple. Furthermore, a counterclaim by the South Korean firm regarding Apple's alleged violation of Samsung's patents resulted in several Apple's devices being banned from sale in Korea, even though a U.S. jury ruled in favor of Apple concerning the same claim. Another patent infringement case between the Canadian Research in Motion (RIM) and the U.S. Visto share many similarities. Visto brought RIM to a U.S. court and, despite Visto's patents being broadly considered invalid, the lawsuit was settled with RIM paying 267.5 million dollars to Visto in 2009. When RIM sued Visto, filing a claim with the Canadian Federal Court for patent violation, the decision was in favor of RIM: Visto was required to pay royalties for RIM's patents. Neither firm had filed a lawsuit in a foreign jurisdiction.====The above prominent cases suggest that the legal system may become a form of protectionism, whereby firms involved in cross-country IPR litigations may have a significant advantage over foreign firms in their home country jurisdictions. In this study, we set out to investigate whether foreign firms are systematically disadvantaged in IPR litigations with domestic firms. We test this hypothesis using data on all IPR litigations in Canada that took place between 2007 and 2010. With 969 litigation cases in our data, we identify the domiciles of the 2,168 firms involved in those cases, and estimate the likelihood of a foreign firm winning a lawsuit against a domestic firm in a Canadian court. We find that the nationality of a firm is a statistically and economically significant determinant of the probability of success in a courtroom and that foreign firms litigating in Canada are much less likely to succeed. Specifically, if both litigants in a case are Canadian firms, the probability of the IPR owner winning the case is 60%. However, if the IPR is owned by a foreign firm, the probability of success against a Canadian company is only 35%.====We next attempt to identify whether foreign firms' disadvantage in IPR disputes can indicate judges' concern for national welfare. A large body of literature analyzes welfare gains from discriminating against foreign IPR owners. The success of a domestic firm in a litigation with a foreign IPR owner implies a transfer of intellectual property, along with the associated market value, to domestic jurisdiction, which increases both the domestic profits and the consumer surplus. Therefore, a welfare-maximizing policy maker may want to protect foreign innovators less rigorously than domestic ones, thus encouraging imitation of foreign technologies by domestic firms. However, the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), to which all World Trade Organization member countries must adhere, prevents countries from using policies that discriminate against foreign innovators. The agreement determines the minimum standards for IPR protection, and the national treatment of foreign entities is an integral part of TRIPS.====However, TRIPS does not regulate the implementation of IPR protection and non-discrimination provisions by legal systems in individual counties,==== allowing the possibility that judges may favor domestic firms in IPR disputes with foreign firms. In particular, being concerned about the impact of their orders on national well-being, judges may factor welfare considerations into their decisions. If domestic firms are more likely to win in IPR disputes with foreign firms, this would result in larger welfare gains and imply that, despite international treaties, countries can achieve better social outcomes by violating national treatment in patent protection. Whether the legal system fosters discrimination against foreign innovators or is independent of national welfare considerations is an empirical question – one we try to answer in this study.====To test whether antiforeign bias is present in the legal system, we develop a simple partial equilibrium model where domestic and foreign firms compete in an oligopolistic market with a homogeneous good. One firm, either domestic or foreign, has access to a more efficient production technology associated with lower production costs, and the other firm may try to imitate it. Using this model, we identify several economic factors that amplify welfare gains from favoring the domestic or the foreign party in an IPR dispute, and thus may influence the decisions of welfare-motivated judges.====First, the model predicts that a welfare-motivated judge is likely to make a biased decision against a foreign IPR owner, but the same judge may not want to favor a domestic IPR owner in a dispute with a foreign firm. The reason is that imitation of foreign technology by domestic firms unambiguously increases national welfare by raising both profits and consumer surplus. In contrast, protecting domestic IPR from imitation by foreigners may decrease national welfare if the loss in consumer surplus outweighs profit gain. Second, a welfare concerned judge is less likely to protect foreign IPR when the domestic imitator is large, in which case imitation has a stronger positive impact on both domestic firms' profits and consumer surplus. Third, the welfare gains from not protecting foreign IPR are increasing in the size of the foreign IPR-owner due to the stronger profit reallocation effect from foreign to domestic firms. Therefore, the model predicts that if welfare considerations lead to a home country bias in the legal system, we should expect the size of the firm to be positively related to the likelihood of success in IPR litigation for domestic firms when the IPR is owned by a foreign firm.====Testing these predictions of the model empirically, we find support for the hypothesis that judges favor domestic parties more when the associated welfare gains from antiforeign bias are larger. First, our analysis reveals that the disadvantage of foreign firms is much stronger when the disputed IPR is owned by the foreign firm. Second, the size of a domestic firm, measured either by revenue or employment, has a positive association with the probability of winning a case against a foreign IPR owner. This relationship is statistically significant and economically sizable: a domestic firm in the 75th percentile of revenue distribution has an additional 17.4 percentage points higher likelihood of winning a lawsuit against a foreign IPR owner relative to a domestic firm in the 25th percentile. This result implies that courts' decisions are aligned with welfare maximization principles. In contrast, we find no evidence that the size of a foreign firm has any effect on litigation outcomes. One possible explanation for this result is that the size of foreign multinationals in the Canadian market is measured less accurately, leading to attenuation bias, but it could also be that judges do not fully internalize the effect of their rulings on welfare.====Taking into account the role and objectives of the legal system in international IPR protection is an important addition to the IPR literature. While the evidence of the presence of home bias in national policies abounds, whereby governments vary the intensity of IPR protection in order to increase national welfare at expense of foreign agents, most of the previous literature assumes that countries operate under the national treatment clause of TRIPS. Our study, in contrast, shows that even if policies conform to the national treatment obligation, discrimination against foreign firms can take place at the implementation level. The legal system can serve as a channel for violation of the national treatment if courts implement policies differently for domestic and foreign firms. Furthermore, the result that the disadvantage against foreign innovators in Canadian courts is systematically related to welfare gains suggests that the legal discrimination against foreign firms is not independent of economic factors and may act as an indirect protectionist policy. Although the positive relationship between antiforeign bias and welfare does not necessarily imply welfare-maximizing behavior of judges,==== we believe that the provocative relationship between courts' decisions and the implied welfare effects will stimulate more research on identification of the factors behind foreign firms' disadvantage in IPR litigations.====Our finding of an antiforeign bias in the legal system makes a broader contribution to the international IPR literature. The strength of IPR protection has been shown to affect trade patterns and firms' exporting decisions. Ivus (2010) provides convincing evidence that improvements in IPR protection increase imports in patent-sensitive industries. McCalman (2005) reports that the strength of IPR protection affects sales of multinationals in developing markets, and Cockburn et al. (2016) find that multinational pharmaceutical companies delay introduction of new products to markets with weak IPR protection. However, in all these studies, the strength of IPR protection is measured by an index that reflects the policy standards for IPR protection but takes no account of the quality of the legal system.==== Since implementation of these policies by legal systems may vary across countries and over time, and given that domestic favoritism of the legal system can counteract strong non-discrimination policies, prejudices against foreign firms in the implementation of the law acts as an implicit trade barrier, affects trade flows, and undermines the goal of free trade.====International IPR protection also affects movement of capital across countries. Javorcik (2004) documents a positive relationship between the strength of IPR enforcement in developing countries and FDI in high-technology sectors by US firms. Branstetter et al. (2006) find that improvement in IPR protection policies leads to increased R&D spending by multinationals operating in these countries, and Branstetter et al. (2011) find that multinationals expand production and employment in countries with better IPR protection. If local courts are viewed skeptically by foreign agents, it is likely to have a substantial impact on multinationals' decisions regarding the location of R&D and production facilities. Aware of this problem, many countries encourage FDI through controversial investor-state dispute settlement procedures, which allow foreign firms to apply for an investor-state arbitration procedure through which arbitrators are able to review nearly any governmental conduct. By avoiding local courts, the resulting arbitral protects foreign investors from discrimination, but reduces the regulatory autonomy of a country and suffers from a lack of judicial accountability, openness, and coherence.====Stronger IPR protection also has the potential to stimulate local innovation, and perceptions of antiforeign bias may have a complex effect on domestic innovation activity. Ang et al. (2014) construct a province-level measure of IPR enforcement in China using data on patent infringements. They find that in provinces with stronger IPR protection, firms enjoy better access to external debt, invest more in R&D, register more patents, and sell more new products.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 surveys the literature on discrimination against foreign nationals in general and in IPR in particular. Section 3 presents the theoretical model of the effect of discrimination against foreign IPR owners on national welfare. Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy, which is followed by the data description in Section 5. The baseline results are reported in Section 6.

Such claim is substantiated by a strong negative relationship between economic activity and an external financial indicator that we construct for several EMEs using micro-level data on spreads of bonds issued by EMEs' corporations in foreign capital markets. Three salient features characterize such a negative relationship. First, the financial indicator has considerable predictive power on future economic activity in these economies, even after controlling for other potential drivers of business cycles such as movements in sovereign spreads and global financial risk, among others. Second, on average, an identified adverse shock to the financial indicator generates a large and protracted fall of real output growth in these economies, and up to 14% of its forecast error variance is associated to this shock. Lastly, fluctuations in this indicator also respond strongly to shocks in global financial risk emanating from world capital markets, thereby implying that changes in corporate spreads also serve as a powerful propagating mechanism of the effect of changes in global investors' risk appetite in emerging markets.","One of the most important macroeconomic developments in emerging market economies (EMEs) since the turn of the XXI century is a considerable increase in the reliance of foreign debt by their ==== sectors. The stock of international debt issued by these economies nearly quadruple in about a little over a decade. For a pool of 18 small EMEs, the outstanding stock of private international debt grew from about 600 billion USD in the early 2000s to 2.4 trillion USD by the end of 2014. Such developments have created an intense debate in both academia and policy circles about their macroeconomic implications and desirability. A benign view posits that for EMEs, often portrayed as credit constrained small open economies, access to international capital markets by the corporate sector is essential for sustaining long-run economic growth, as it can provide domestic entrepreneurs with needed funds to finance new investment projects that they would otherwise not be able to raise from local sources. However, the crises of the 1990s and, more recently, the global financial crisis of 2008, have taught us that greater access to capital markets entails also risks for EMEs; particularly stemming from abrupt changes in the amount and the cost of international capital. This has placed at center stage, yet again, the role of external financial conditions as important drivers of economic activity in EMEs, although with a novel twist relative to previous episodes of surges in external debt that were mostly linked to sovereigns: the role of corporate external debt and its impact on the macroeconomy of EMEs.====This paper aims at shedding new light on the role that external financial factors play when accounting for economic activity in emerging economies, through their effects on debt issued by their corporates in international capital markets. Our particular interest is to quantify the extent to which changes in the lending conditions faced by the ==== sector of EMEs in world capital markets are related to economic activity in these economies. For that purpose we build an external financial indicator for ten EMEs using individual bond-level data on spreads from corporate bonds issued in foreign capital markets and traded in secondary markets. We then quantify how much information this indicator contains in terms of future fluctuations in economic activity in these economies, how this activity responds to shocks in the indicator, and how such indicator serves also as propagating mechanism for shocks in global capital markets. Our focus is on bond issuance because it is this form of finance that corporates have preferred the most when increasing their reliance on international sources of funding since the mid 2000s.====We find strong evidence that this external financial indicator contains information on future economic activity in EMEs, after controlling for domestic and external factors that may also drive aggregate fluctuations in these economies. Results from panel forecasting regressions indicate that, on average, an increase of 100 basis points in the external financial indicator is correlated with a decrease in real output growth of 0.1 percentage points in the following quarter, and up to 0.4 percentage points three quarters ahead. Furthermore, a shock to the external financial indicator, identified within a panel structural vector autoregressive (P-SVAR) model, generates a large and protracted fall in economic activity. On average, a one standard deviation shock in the external financial indicator leads to a fall in real output growth three quarters ahead of more than half of a percentage point, relative to its historic mean, and long run mean growth is reached again 3 years after the shock. Lastly, between 6 and 14 percent of the forecast error variance in real output growth is accounted for by these shocks.====A key challenge of our approach is to properly control for the effects of sovereign spreads on business cycles in EMEs. We follow the literature by using JP Morgan's ==== as proxy for this spread and find that, in terms of the forecasting information content on economic activity, it does not come out as statistically significant once we control for our measure of corporate spreads, regardless of the forecasting horizon considered. It only does when we deliberately omit our indicator from the forecasting regressions. Furthermore, from the estimated P-SVAR model we find that the variance share of real GDP growth associated to ==== shocks, when not controlling for shocks to corporate spreads, is already small—between 2 and 4%—and further reduces by about half when one controls for them. In contrast, the variance share associated to shocks to our indicator of corporate spreads remains unchanged after we control for ====. Overall we view this evidence ==== as pointing that sovereign spreads do not matter when accounting for business cycles in EMEs. Instead, we view it as signaling that researchers ought to take into account ==== corporate and sovereign spreads when accounting for driving forces of aggregate fluctuations in EMEs, as there appears to be some market segmentation between the two debt instruments.====Another finding of interest is the preponderant role of global financial risk, for which we use two alternative proxies, the ==== and the ==== corporate ==== spread. Both turn out as statistically significant covariates in our forecasting regressions of economic activity. Moreover, identified shocks to both proxies in the estimated P-SVAR models account for a sizeable share of the variance of real economic activity. The important role of shocks to global risk is also prevalent when it comes to accounting for the variance of our measure of corporate spreads. Notably, ==== and ==== shocks account, respectively, for 21 and 24 percent of the variability of our index of corporate spreads, making fluctuations in corporate spreads a propagating mechanism of global financial risk into EMEs. We quantify such propagation force by establishing that the share of real GDP growth variance associated with ==== shocks falls by a half, from 31 to 16 percent, when, the linkages from global risk to corporate spreads are counterfactually turned off. ====, on the other hand, serves relatively less of a propagating mechanism for these shocks.====This paper is related to and contributes to four different strands of literature. The stylized facts that we document in terms of the patterns in external financing by EMEs contribute to the work by Shin (2014), Turner (2014) and Powell (2014), among others, on how corporations from emerging economies have stepped up their financing in international capital markets. Our work complements this literature by providing a systematic analysis of the external financing patterns exhibited by several EMEs, particularly the large increase by non-financial corporations (NFCs) in international bond issuance.====Our work also relates to a long standing literature that studies the relevance of external financial factors for aggregate fluctuations in EMEs.==== External financial factors in this literature are typically proxied by U.S. interest rates or spreads of EMEs' ==== debt (see e.g., Canova, 2005; Uribe and Yue, 2006), finding that they explain a sizeable proportion of business cycles.==== Akinci (2013) further shows that the effect of international financial conditions on EMEs is also largely driven by risk aversion in global financial markets and propagated by its effect on sovereign spreads.==== We contribute to this literature by paying particular attention to the role of ==== debt when quantifying the role of external financial factors.====The kind of empirical work that we undertake when constructing an external financial indicator directly from bond spreads is mostly inspired by the “ground-up” approach of Gilchrist et al. (2009), who study the predictive ability of bond spreads on business fluctuations in the U.S. in the 1990–2008 period (and subsequently extended to a longer sample by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek, 2012, and to the case of Western Europe by Gilchrist and Mojon, 2018). Our study follows this research agenda on exploring the predictive content of credit spreads—by constructing a country-aggregate bond spread based on micro data—but does not attempt to decompose the spread into the component associated to the idiosyncratic default-risk of firms and a residual (i.e., the excess bond premium, as dubbed by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek, 2012). In this sense, our paper expands the analysis to explore the usefulness of market-based corporate credit spreads as predictors of economic activity for the case of EMEs, but it is silent on whether the information content of corporate spreads comes from the idiosyncratic default risk of bond issuers or from deviations in the pricing of corporate bonds relative to issuers' default risk. Our contribution lies in bringing together this new literature on corporate spreads as predictors of economic activity with the extensive literature on external factors and sovereign spreads as predictors of economic activity in EMEs.====A final strand of literature that our paper is also related to is the one that has developed a new vintage of dynamic and stochastic equilibrium models aimed at accounting for business cycles in EMEs through financial shocks and the amplifying effects of financial frictions (Fernández and Gulan, 2015).==== Our work contributes to this literature by providing empirical evidence of the hypotheses derived from these models regarding the links between corporate bond spreads and economic activity, while providing evidence that external financial factors are a key determinant of economic activity in EMEs through their effect on the corporate sector.====The rest of this work is divided into six sections, including this introduction. Section 2 presents the stylized facts on international corporate borrowing in EMEs. Section 3 describes how we construct the external financial indicator and provides descriptive statistics on its business cycle dynamics. Section 4 presents our benchmark forecasting regression and P-SVAR results. Section 5 presents various extensions and robustness checks. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 6. An online appendix gathers further technical material as well as more robustness analysis.","On corporate borrowing, credit spreads and economic activity in emerging economies: An empirical investigation",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219961830446X,May 2019,2019,Research Article,274.0

Using a rich dataset on Belgian firms for the period 1995–2005, we show that: i) firms are much more likely to source services and goods inputs from the same origin country rather than from different ones; ii) joint imports are associated with higher firm productivity; iii) increases in barriers to imports of goods reduce firm-level imports of services from the same market, and conversely. We build upon a discrete-choice model of goods and services input sourcing that can reproduce these facts to guide our ==== strategy. We use our results to quantify the impact of reductions in goods and services barriers between the US and the EU. Our findings have important implications for the design of ","Services feature prominently on the trade liberalization agenda. After the recent Canada-EU Trade Agreement (CETA), the European Commission stated that “ around half of the overall GDP gains for the EU will come from liberalising trade in services”.==== The recent Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) initiative between the US, the EU and 21 trade partners aims to breathe new life into the Doha Round liberalization talks. While the future of a trade agreement between the US and EU is highly uncertain in the current political climate, the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) had services at the heart of its “ Market Access” chapter. At the same time a key element in the ongoing Brexit negotiations for the UK, the second largest services exporter in the world, is the future of trade in services with both the EU and the rest of the world.====To date, the economic evaluation of services trade barriers has relied on sector-specific studies (Francois and Hoekman, 2010), general equilibrium work with separate goods and services sectors (Francois et al., 2003; Egger et al., 2012) or services-only gravity models (Anderson et al., 2014). Yet, both anecdotal evidence and recent research show increasingly blurred boundaries between the manufacturing and services sectors. Production and trade statistics reveal significant services sales, exports and imports by manufacturing firms.==== This may partly reflect a “servitization” process, i.e., a shift from products to solutions and integrated “ product-service systems” (Neely, 2008), as well as a greater reliance of manufacturing firms on intermediate services, both domestic and imported (Nordås, 2010; Timmer et al., 2013). These observations raise the possibility that goods trade may benefit from services trade liberalization, and vice versa.====In this paper, we study if and how both types of trade interact at the level of individual firms. In particular, we study how firms' imports of goods respond to the liberalization of trade in services, and how firms' imports of services react to goods trade liberalization. We believe this question is important for at least two reasons. First, simultaneous imports of goods and services are a first-order feature of our data, representing more than 80% of the total value of Belgian imports. Thus, existing firm-level research focused exclusively on, for example, goods trade completely overlooks an important services trade component, and vice versa. Secondly, estimating the interactions between the two forms of trade is directly relevant for the design of trade policy and for ongoing trade negotiations. Indeed, if there are complementarities in sourcing goods and services from the same origin, lowering services barriers might lead to higher services ==== goods imports. This also suggests that recent efforts to liberalize trade in services - where trade barriers are still significant - might be highly effective at increasing ==== trade given that tariff barriers have already fallen to historically low levels.====To explore the interactions between goods and services trade and trade liberalization at the firm level, we start by analyzing highly disaggregated data on Belgian firms' imports between 1995 and 2005. Our descriptive exercise shows three main patterns: i) firms are disproportionately more likely to import goods and services from the same rather than from separate origins; ii) firms sourcing goods and services from the same origin show better performance across a range of productivity measures, both in a cross-section and in a difference-in-difference analysis; iii) reduced-form regressions suggest that, even when controlling for firm-year and country unobservables, a reduction in the goods trade barriers imposed against a country increases the likelihood of observing positive services imports from that same country, and lower services trade barriers make goods imports more likely as well.====We build a model of goods and services input sourcing which can reproduce these stylized facts and offers guidance for our subsequent empirical analysis. The model features a final sector and two (goods and services) intermediate sectors. Final producers may source intermediate goods and services domestically or from abroad. To capture the observed sparsity of imports across origin countries, intermediate sourcing is represented as a discrete choice between pairs of country-specific goods and services varieties. The model fully specifies the probability of sourcing inputs from different countries and shows that this probability increases in input quality and decreases with trade costs, all else equal. Conditional on that choice, goods and services import values are specified as functions of a narrow set of parameters. The model also allows for technological complementarities between inputs coming from the same origin country.====We then use the model to guide our estimation strategy. We use a two-stage econometric approach where the first stage describes the choice of origin countries and the second stage describes the value of imports of goods and services from chosen country pairs. The theoretical model provides us with guidance on how to combine and interpret parameters as well as on how to deal with selection bias in a consistent and parsimonious way. More specifically, we use the selection model developed in Lee (1983) and described by Bourguignon et al. (2007). The first-stage selection equation features a conditional multinomial logit for the probability to source inputs from a given country. In the second stage, we estimate two export value outcome regressions, one for goods and one for services, that are augmented with selection-bias controls coming from the first stage. We also allow for both firm-specific time-varying and country-specific time-invariant unobservables that may be arbitrarily correlated with the regressors in both the first and second stage.====Finally, we use our estimates to perform a quantification exercise. We examine the impact of three policy experiments consisting in reductions in goods and services trade barriers between the EU and the US. We find large trade gains stemming from further integration that, in the current international political climate, might well be best considered as foregone gains from the lack of further integration. In particular, we look at the “elimination” of goods tariffs and services trade barriers between the EU and the US, first separately, then together. In the case of services, we assume that trade barriers between the US and the EU are lowered to a level corresponding to countries having bilateral preferential trade agreements including a services component, as reported by the WTO secretariat. Results reveal substantial gains from liberalizing trade with the US. A joint good-service liberalization would boost Belgian imports from the US by 22% for goods and 11% for services. Assuming the same increase for the whole of the EU would imply an increase in imports of, respectively, 60 and 24 billion dollars. An important element in our results is that the gains from liberalizing both goods and services together are higher than the sum of liberalizing goods and services separately. This demonstrates the presence of strong complementarities between goods and services trade that have the potential of amplifying the impact of changes in trade barriers. We believe that this is an observation that deserves more attention in current trade negotiations.====In addition to the literature on the quantification of services trade barriers mentioned above, our work contributes to a small number of papers studying the connections between services and goods trade and production at the level of individual firms. This literature has been mostly descriptive in nature, highlighting the importance of firms trading in, or producing, both goods and services (e.g. Lodefalk, 2013; Crozet and Milet, 2017b; Ariu, 2016b). Three recent exceptions are Breinlich et al. (2018), Crozet and Milet (2017a) and Ariu et al. (2018). Breinlich et al. (2018) analyze the impact of goods trade liberalization on the shift of UK manufacturing firms into services, but do not look at trade responses nor at the interaction between goods and services imports. Crozet and Milet (2017a) study the interaction between goods and services in the domestic market, finding that service sales have a positive impact on the performance of manufacturing firms. Their paper complements ours with a domestic perspective on the relationship between goods and service production but does not investigate the related policy issues. Ariu et al. (2018) investigate why manufacturing exporters associate services with goods exports and provide micro-foundations for the different mechanisms that can explain the complementarity between goods and services. While complementing our work on the export as opposed to the import side, they do not look at trade policy scenarios.====Our work is also related to recent quantitative models of firm-level imports, such as Kasahara and Lapham (2013), Armenter and Koren (2013) and Antras et al. (2017). While these papers also look at import sourcing at the firm level, they do not incorporate services trade and its interaction with goods trade.====Finally, we follow a growing literature in using the OECD's Product Market Regulation Index (PMR) to capture the degree of policy restrictiveness in a range of service sectors. A number of recent papers have demonstrated that restrictions in upstream service sectors can negatively affect the performance of the downstream manufacturing sectors using those services (see Barone and Cingano (2011); Bourles et al. (2013); Arnold et al. (2016)). Similar to Crozet et al. (2016) we argue here that the PMR is also well suited to capturing import barriers and show how it can be used to explain the sourcing choices of Belgian manufacturing firms.====This paper is organized in five additional sections. Section2 presents the data and the stylized facts paving the way for the theoretical model. Section3 offers a model of firm-level importing of goods and services intermediate inputs consistent with these facts.

Candian Giacomo,"HEC Montréal, Department of Applied Economics, 3000 chemin de la Côte-Sainte-Catherine, Montréal, Québec, Canada H3T 2A7.","Received 7 September 2017, Revised 2 November 2018, Accepted 19 November 2018, Available online 30 November 2018, Version of Record 13 December 2018.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2018.11.006,Cited by (11), volatility and persistence of the real exchange rate. The model also accounts for the persistent and hump-shaped real exchange rate behavior ==== on nominal disturbances documented by a structural VAR. About 50% of this persistence is due to the inertial dynamics of higher-order beliefs.,"Real exchange rates have been extremely volatile and persistent since the end of the Bretton Woods system (Mussa, 1986). For many developed economies, real exchange rates are roughly four times as volatile as output, and their fluctuations exhibit a half-life in the range of three to five years.==== Moreover, real and nominal exchange rates are highly correlated.==== In principle, sticky-price models can explain this correlation and volatility: if price levels fail to adjust, changes in nominal exchange rates following nominal shocks will readily translate in real exchange rate movements. However, such models cannot produce the observed persistence under plausible nominal rigidities, as demonstrated by Bergin and Feenstra (2001) and Chari et al. (2002).====In this paper, I demonstrate that a two-country, general-equilibrium model with noisy, dispersed information à la Woodford (2002) can reconcile these empirical features of real exchange rates. The framework is estimated via likelihood methods using data from the US and the Euro Area. I then show that the model explains the ==== moments of the real exchange rate, as well as its moments ==== on nominal disturbances. In the model, monetary shocks have real effects because noisy information results in inertial dynamics of firms' beliefs. Furthermore, with strategic complementarities in price-setting, dispersed information makes a producer's optimal price depend not only on their beliefs about exogenous disturbances but also on their higher-order beliefs—i.e., beliefs about other producers' beliefs. The sluggish adjustment of higher-order beliefs rationalizes why nominal shocks have persistent real effects, and is quantitatively important, accounting for almost 50% of the conditional persistence of the real exchange rate.====The paper makes two main contributions to the literature. The first is to show that the estimated open-economy dispersed-information model explains the unconditional persistence and volatility of the real exchange rate, as well as its correlation with the nominal exchange rate. Closed-economy models in which agents are imperfectly informed are known to be quantitatively successful in accounting for the persistent effects of monetary disturbances on output and inflation (Melosi, 2014) documented by VAR studies (e.g. Christiano et al., 2005). However, little is known about these models' ability to explain the behavior of international relative prices. This paper fills this gap. First, I show analytically that an open-economy framework with dispersed information can deliver highly volatile and persistent real exchange rates. Second, by estimating it, I demonstrate that the model is quantitatively successful in accounting for these empirical features. The paper thus provides a novel explanation for the observed real exchange rate fluctuations.====The second main contribution is to demonstrate that the model accounts for the conditional behavior of the real exchange rate in response to nominal disturbances. Using a structural VAR, I document that real exchange rates display persistent and hump-shaped dynamics in response to nominal shocks, in line with previous evidence in Clarida and Gali (1994). I then show that the model successfully explains these features, generating endogenous persistence from the inertial dynamics of higher-order beliefs. A decomposition of this persistence shows that dispersed information is quantitatively important, almost doubling the half-life of the real exchange rate in comparison to a counterfactual economy with noisy information but no role for higher-order beliefs. These results contrast with those coming from an estimated benchmark model of sticky prices, which generates relatively low persistence in response to nominal shocks even in the presence of strategic complementarities.====The information friction that I model is motivated by the mounting evidence about heterogeneity in beliefs among decision makers. Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2012) document that there is considerable dispersion in inflation forecasts within the Federal Reserve's Survey of Professional Forecasters or the Michigan Survey of Consumers. Recent survey evidence shows that there is also widespread dispersion in beliefs of firms about macroeconomic conditions (Coibion et al., 2015), suggesting that producers have their own “window on the world” (Amato and Shin, 2006). In such an environment, defending a firm's market share amounts to second-guessing a competitor's pricing strategy. This second-guessing game might prove particularly challenging in an open economy, where firms face competition not only from domestic firms but also from foreign exporters.====I follow Woodford (2002) and Melosi (2014) in modeling this heterogeneity in beliefs. In the baseline model, firms observe private, idiosyncratic signals about nominal aggregate demand and aggregate productivity in the two countries. They also face strategic complementarity in price-setting, which implies that a firm's optimal price depends positively on the prices set by competitors. Strategic interactions and heterogeneous information often result in tractability issues, as the state space becomes infinite dimensional when agents are required to forecast the forecast of others. This problem is more severe in open-economy models, which additionally feature heterogeneity of agents across countries and fluctuations in international prices. I exploit the symmetry of the model and the equilibrium characterization of the terms of trade to provide an analytical solution that only requires keeping track of two weighted-averages of higher-order beliefs. The solution, in turn, allows me to gain deep insights into the driving forces of the real exchange rate and to conduct a likelihood evaluation of the model.====My analytical results show that the volatility and persistence of the real exchange rate are higher (i) the lower is the precision of firms' signals about aggregate demand and (ii) the higher is the degree of strategic complementarity. Intuitively, when signals are not very precise, firms learn gradually about changes in nominal aggregate demand and sluggishly update their prices. When strategic complementarities are strong, firms place more weight on higher-order beliefs, which update slowly, as the private signals a firm receives provide relatively little information about the signals of other firms. Both of these channels slow down the price adjustment, delivering volatile and persistent real exchange rates following nominal shocks. Notably, strategic complementarity depends on the degree of the economies' openness and on the substitutability between domestic- and foreign-produced goods. Thus, foreign competition provides a channel through which the adjustment of prices might be delayed, one that is naturally absent in closed-economy models.====I then assess whether the framework can quantitatively explain the dynamics of the Euro-Dollar real exchange rate in the period between 1973 and 2008. The theoretical results suggest that the model would be able to generate a highly volatile and persistent real exchange rate with a sufficiently low signal precision. However, it is unclear which values of signal precision should be considered empirically relevant, given the scarce existing evidence on these parameters. To address this shortcoming, I estimate the model parameters via likelihood methods using real GDP and GDP deflator data for the US and the Euro Area. These data do not directly contain information on the real exchange rate, which is instead defined as the nominal exchange rate adjusted by consumption price indices.====The exclusion of the real exchange rate from the estimation allows me to conduct an out-of-sample test for the model. Specifically, I simulate the model at the estimated parameter values and ask whether it reproduces the unconditional dynamics of the Euro/Dollar real exchange rate, which were not targeted in the estimation. I show that the model successfully explains these dynamics, as measured by the volatility and persistence of the real exchange rate. In particular, the model delivers a half-life of roughly 4 years for the real exchange rate, which is very close to the empirical counterpart of 3.5 years. The framework also generates highly correlated nominal and real exchange rates. Additionally, the estimated signal-to-noise ratios suggest that signals about nominal aggregate conditions are less precise than those about productivity, which generates persistent and hump-shaped dynamics of the real exchange rate conditional on nominal shocks. Using a structural VAR approach, I show that nominal shocks do generate long-lived and hump-shaped responses for the Euro/Dollar real exchange rate, which are consistent with the model's propagation mechanism.====I also compare the model's predictions with those of a benchmark sticky-price framework, which is estimated using the same data on real GDP and GDP deflators. The sticky-price model deviates from the dispersed-information model in only two respects: (i) all agents are perfectly informed, and (ii) firms can optimally adjust their prices only in random periods, as in Calvo (1983). Two sets of results emerge. First, the dispersed-information model fits the data better than the sticky-price model, as suggested by a Bayesian model comparison. Second, the estimated Calvo model generates counterfactually low real exchange rate persistence following nominal shocks, confirming the intuition behind the results of Chari et al. (2002).====The nominal disturbances that I consider might arise from monetary policy shocks and from other exogenous disturbances that affect aggregate demand, including those that originate in the financial sector. A recent literature has emphasized the importance of financial shocks to account for exchange rate movements, as they can potentially address several exchange rate puzzles by driving a wedge into the risk-sharing and UIP conditions (Itskhoki and Mukhin, 2017). In the last part of the paper, I thus investigate the role of such shocks in my framework by explicitly introducing shocks to international asset demand and re-estimating the models to fit also the real exchange rate data. The results suggest that financial shocks account for the bulk of real and nominal exchange rate unconditional volatility, in line with the findings from the calibration exercise of Itskhoki and Mukhin (2017). Financial shocks also partially address other puzzles such as the exchange-rate disconnect and the UIP puzzle. At the same time, my previous results hold in this extended framework: the dispersed-information model still well explains the persistence of the real exchange rate, and outperforms the Calvo model in fitting the data as well as in reproducing the empirical propagation of nominal disturbances.====This paper contributes to the growing literature that focuses on the aggregate implications of dispersed information among price setters, such as Woodford (2002), Maćkowiak and Wiederholt (2009), Nimark (2008), and Melosi (2014), which builds on the seminal contributions of Phelps (1970) and Lucas (1972). In contrast to these closed-economy contributions, this paper studies the implications for international prices, where uncertainty about foreign demand as well as the actions of foreign competitors plays an important role. My analysis lends further empirical support to the dispersed-information theory and shows that it is central to the understanding of real exchange rate dynamics.====The paper is also naturally related to the literature that studies real exchange rate dynamics within monetary models, such as Johri and Lahiri (2008) and Carvalho and Nechio (2011), in addition to the contributions already mentioned. Relative to this literature, this paper highlights the importance of a source of endogenous persistence in real exchange rates—dispersed information in environments with strategic complementarities—that has so far not been studied in this context. Indeed, the estimated dispersed-information framework generates substantial persistence in the real exchange rate resorting to a modest degree of exogenous persistence in nominal aggregate demand. The model is thus able to explain the real exchange rate persistence without compromising its ability to account for other aspects of the data, such as the autocorrelation of nominal exchange rates.====Finally, the present study adds to the small body of literature that focuses on information frictions in open economies. Bacchetta and van Wincoop, 2006, Bacchetta and van Wincoop, 2010 introduce information frictions in the foreign exchange market to study the exchange-rate disconnect and the forward-discount puzzle. While in these studies incomplete information is on the agents trading assets (i.e., investors/households), this paper studies the role of information frictions on the agents pricing goods (i.e., firms), thus switching the focus from assets markets to goods markets. Crucini et al. (2010) introduce sticky information à la Mankiw and Reis (2002) in a sticky-price model to explain the volatility and persistence of deviations from the law of one price. In contrast, this paper explains the substantially longer half-life of aggregate real exchange rates by relying only on dispersed information and Bayesian updating, which is consistent with recent evidence on the behavior of firms (Coibion et al., 2015).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the dispersed-information model. Section 3 provides some analytical results. Section 4 discusses the solution method. Section 5 analyzes the model's impulse responses. Section 6 contains the empirical analysis. Section 7 traces a comparison with the sticky-price model.

While an increase in government purchases causes real exchange rates to appreciate and increases consumption significantly in developing countries, it causes real exchange rates to depreciate and decreases consumption in advanced countries. The current account decreases in both groups of countries. These findings are not consistent with standard international business cycle models. We discuss potential sources of the differences between advanced and developing countries in the responses to spending shocks.","What are the open economy effects of government spending? Conventional wisdom—as well as mainstream macroeconomic models used by policymakers—suggests that an increase in government spending puts pressure on the domestic currency to appreciate, leading to a decrease in the current account (and potentially a “twin deficit”) and a decrease in consumption through an international risk-sharing condition. This mechanism holds across a wide range of models, including both New Keynesian and neoclassical models. However, empirical evidence for such a mechanism has not been settled. For example, Corsetti and Müller (2006), Kim and Roubini (2008), and Müller (2008), among others, find that in U.S. data, the trade balance increases after a government spending shock. In contrast, using data for Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Monacelli and Perotti (2010) and Ravn et al. (2012) estimate that a rise in government spending causes a trade deficit, as well as real depreciation of the domestic currency and an increase in consumption. Given these contrasting empirical results in studies of a relatively small number of countries, several questions on the effects of government spending in an open economy remain: Does government spending cause appreciation of real exchange rates and does it decrease the current account? What is the relationship between the real exchange rate and consumption conditional on government spending shocks? Are the effects of government spending shocks different across countries, such as between advanced and developing countries, or between the fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes?====This paper addresses these important questions using a large dataset for 125 countries between 1989 and 2013. We document new evidence on the effects of government spending on the real exchange rate, current accounts, and consumption. Importantly, we exploit the information in both advanced and developing countries to distinguish the effects of government spending in advanced countries from those in developing countries. Our data also let us examine the differential effects of government spending depending on exchange rate regimes and the level of trade openness. Since government spending can affect the state of the economy and vice versa, we identify government spending shocks using exogenous variation in international military spending. Military spending has been used in the closed economy literature (e.g., Ramey and Shapiro, 1998; Hall, 2009; Barro and Redlick, 2011; Ramey, 2011), but remains underutilized in the open economy literature. Additionally, we focus on the empirical relationship between the real exchange rate and consumption—i.e., the risk-sharing condition, conditional on government spending shocks. This focus can give us a powerful diagnosis of international business cycle models, because in the models, this relationship does not depend on the assumptions about price rigidities, monetary policy, tax policy, import and export shares, or country sizes.====We document a number of new empirical facts. First, for all countries, on average, in response to a positive government spending shock, the real exchange rate appreciates on impact, and the effect is also significant the following year. After an increase in government spending of 1% of GDP, the real exchange rate appreciates by 3.5% on impact and by 3.2% one year after the shock. The effect is most pronounced in countries with a flexible exchange rate regime. Consistent with Monacelli and Perotti (2010) and Ravn et al. (2012), we also find that the current account decreases significantly in response to a positive government spending shock. Consumption increases substantially, peaking at three years after the change in government spending.====Second, the effects of government spending on the real exchange rate and consumption are significantly different between advanced and developing countries. The real exchange rate depreciates on impact by 1.5% in advanced countries, but it appreciates significantly by 4.3% in developing countries. The real exchange rate depreciation in advanced economies is consistent with evidence in Enders et al. (2011), Ravn et al. (2012), Ilzetzki et al. (2013), and Kim (2015). Thus, our paper contributes to this literature by providing additional evidence that government spending shocks lead to a depreciation of real exchange rates in advanced economies using a different identification approach. However, unlike Ilzetzki et al. (2013), who find that in developing countries the real exchange rate appreciates on impact but exhibits depreciation at a two-year horizon, we find robust appreciation. Furthermore, in our data, consumption increases with government spending in developing countries, but the response is negative and statistically insignificant in advanced countries. The decline in consumption in advanced countries is consistent with the results based on a smaller sample in Ilzetzki et al. (2013). The current account decreases in both groups. The decrease of the current account in advanced countries is consistent with Ilzetzki et al. (2013), but not with Kim (2015). At the same time, the behavior of the current account in developing countries is not in line with Ilzetzki et al. (2013), who find a statistically insignificant increase of the current account in their sample of developing countries.====Our empirical results have two important implications. First, we find that standard international business cycle models can explain the current account decrease observed in the full sample and the real exchange rate appreciation observed in developing countries. However, for advanced countries, the real exchange rate appreciates in the model, whereas it depreciates in the data, an inconsistency known in the literature as the “real exchange rate puzzle.” Second, the key discrepancy between models with complete asset markets and the data is in the consumption–real exchange rate relationship, called the “risk-sharing condition.” While the model with complete asset markets predicts a negative relationship between the two variables, it is positive in both advanced- and developing-countries samples. In other words, we document a risk-sharing puzzle conditional on government spending shocks. This result is in line with the unconditional risk-sharing puzzle documented in Backus and Smith (1993) and Kollmann (1995), as well as with Kim (2015), who finds that consumption declines and the real exchange rate depreciates in his sample of advanced countries. At the same time, our empirical consumption–real exchange rate relationship is at odds with Monacelli and Perotti (2010) and Ravn et al. (2012), who find no risk-sharing puzzle conditional on government spending shocks in their sample of four advanced countries. We discuss some extensions of the standard model that can explain the effects of government spending in both advanced and developing countries.====To facilitate our analysis, we compile an extensive dataset of government spending, real exchange rates, current accounts, and consumption for both advanced and developing countries. Since quarterly data for many countries are lacking and of low quality, covering many countries in the dataset naturally leads to the use of annual data. The resulting dataset consists of 125 countries in the period 1989–2013, including 96 developing countries. The variables include military spending, total government spending, and several other important national-account aggregates and macroeconomic indicators. Importantly, we gather information on periods of war, political risks, financial crises, and commodity exporters to examine how these factors may affect our estimates.====Our identification of government spending shocks comes from the assumption that military spending is exogenous to the state of the economy. We implement this identification strategy using a local projections method, as in Jordà (2005). This methodology has been widely used in the literature on the effects of government spending shocks (e.g., Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012; Miyamoto et al., 2018; Ramey and Zubairy, 2018). Total government spending is instrumented by military spending. In our estimation, government spending shocks come from fluctuations in military spending that cannot be explained by past business cycles proxied by the lags of output, government spending, wars, and other variables. Overall, military spending is a reasonably strong instrument, comfortably passing relevance tests in the full sample of countries, as well as in the subsamples of advanced and developing countries. To provide reassurance for our identification strategy, we perform numerous checks of our results' sensitivity to alternative sample compositions and specifications, and the assumption of military spending exogeneity. We find that our baseline results are robust.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. We describe the data in Section2. Section3 discusses our identification strategy. Section4 presents our empirical strategy. The main empirical results are in Section5, followed by numerous robustness and identification checks in Section6. We compare our results with previous literature in Section7. Section8 relates our empirical results to international business cycle models.

We construct the type of each worker using both a traditional wage regression and a theory-based approach and compute measures of the average worker type and worker type dispersion at the firm level. We find that exporting firms feature a lower type dispersion in the pool of workers they hire. This effect is quantitatively larger than the common finding in the literature that exporters pay higher wages because, among other factors, they employ better workers. The matching between exporting firms and workers is even tighter in sectors characterized by better exporting opportunities as measured by foreign demand or tariff shocks. Our findings are consistent with a model of matching between heterogeneous workers and firms in which variation in the worker type at the firm level exists in equilibrium only because of the presence of search costs. When firms gain access to the foreign market, matching with the ==== becomes particularly important because deviations from the ideal match quickly reduce the higher potential value of the relationship. Hence, exporting firms select sets of workers that are less dispersed relative to the average. This analysis is suggestive of the presence of additional gains from trade due to improved sorting.","The pattern of sorting of workers across firms has fundamental implications for the efficiency of the economy as well as for the inequality of wages in the labor force. The first implication has been a concern of the literature on assignment starting from Shapley and Shubik (1971) and Becker (1973). From those contributions we know that when firms and workers are complementary in production, then the allocation of high-type workers to high-type firms maximizes output. The second implication has received attention more recently by Card et al. (2013), who show that sorting of good workers to good firms can explain 35% of the recent increase in wage inequality in West Germany. The logic is that highly skilled workers are paid more not only because of their innate higher productivity, but also because they work with highly productive firms and co-workers (as in Kremer and Maskin, 1996).====In this paper, we start from the premise that the optimal allocation of workers cannot be reached because of the presence of search costs, and therefore firms accept some degree of mismatch in equilibrium because the cost of search exceeds the benefit from a more suited partner. We then explore whether the matching of firms and workers is affected by access of the former to the export market. But how can market integration affect the matching between firms and workers? When firms gain access to the foreign market, their revenue potential increases. When potential surplus is high, complementarity implies that matching with the right worker becomes particularly important because deviations from the ideal match quickly reduce the value of the relationship.====Using matched employer-employee data from France, we show that exporters select pools of workers characterized by a higher average type and a lower type dispersion than non-exporting firms. While the first effect is predicted by other models (Helpman et al., 2010 and Sampson, 2014), we believe we offer a novel way of testing this prediction, which disentangles pure exporter wage premia (deriving from profit-sharing with workers as in Amiti and Cameron, 2012) from the selection of better workers by exporting firms. The second effect – i.e. the influence of exporting on worker type dispersion – is unexplored in the literature and is, according to our results, quantitatively as strong as the effect of exporting on worker average type. While at an exporting firm worker ability is higher by 3% of a standard deviation, variability is lower by 4.9% of a standard deviation.====Obviously, the simple cross-sectional correlation between export status and type dispersion may be spuriously determined by omitted variables. Therefore, we adopt two empirical strategies in addition to our baseline estimation. The first is to show that the effect of exporting on type dispersion is stronger when exporters face a positive demand shock in foreign markets. In particular, we build measures of exporting opportunities in different sectors using tariffs and aggregate imports from the various countries to which France exports. Whether we build these measures at the firm or sector level (using previous period export shares), we find that when exporters face lower tariffs or larger demand for imports in a foreign market, the dispersion of types in their pool of workers declines further. We believe this result is harder to reconcile with a view that the exporting and tightening of the matching are both driven by a common excluded factor. The second approach in dealing with the correlation of export status with other unobserved characteristics (that may affect the choice of workers) is to employ instrumental variables. We again build a variable that interacts the firm export share to a given market in the previous period with changes in tariffs imposed by that country in that sector. Our instrument is valid according to standard criteria and qualitatively confirms our OLS results.====Our results are consistent with a simple open-economy extension of the model proposed by Eeckhout and Kircher (2011) and the implied variability in the worker type tolerated by the firm in their framework. On the one hand, because of complementarity, matching with a worker with ability below the firm's ideal type is associated with lower output; the difference from the optimal output tends to be larger the higher the firm productivity. On the other hand, a worker type that is above the optimal one for the firm requires an increasing compensation due to her outside option. Such compensation rises much faster at firms that are more productive because they employ, on average, more productive types. The result is that firms that are more productive, or that have access to the export market, tolerate less relative dispersion from their ideal worker type. If we interpret a firm as a collection of independent worker-job matches, this result translates to a lower variation in the ability of workers employed at exporting firms.====We consider alternative interpretations of our empirical result, based on changes in organizational structure that could also result from increased market access as in Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) and Friedrich (2018). These studies find that firms respond to a positive trade shock, like increased market access, by adding hierarchical layers to their organization, thus inducing an increase in wage inequality within the firm. This effect on hierarchies is compatible with the mechanism linking type dispersion to export opportunities that we focus on. Nevertheless, the findings of Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) and Friedrich (2018) suggest that we need to carefully control for occupational structure. We do this in two ways. First, we focus on type dispersion ==== occupation groups. Second, we control for a variable that captures changes in wage dispersion that are due to differences in the occupation structure of firms. Both results reassure us that these two mechanisms can be present in the data, but that our findings are not due to a hierarchical change in the firm due to export opportunities.",Does exporting improve matching?

We first identify 908 unique estimates of the effects of FTAs on different trading pairs for the years 1986–2006. We then employ these estimates as our dependent variable in a “second stage” analysis characterizing the heterogeneity in these effects. Interestingly, most of this heterogeneity (∼2/3) occurs within FTAs (rather than across different FTAs), with asymmetric effects within pairs (on exports vs. imports) also playing an important role. Our second stage analysis provides several intuitive explanations behind these variations. Even within the same agreement, FTA effects are weaker for more distant pairs and for pairs with otherwise high levels of ","After a quarter-century of unprecedented trade integration, the world may be taking a momentary pause to re-evaluate the economic impact of free trade agreements. The past few years have seen the United Kingdom threaten to leave the E.U., the United States insist on the re-negotiation of NAFTA, and the high profile failures of TTIP and TPP- two would-be “mega deals” which together would have made 60% of the world's production more interdependent by eliminating barriers to trade. While economic integration has always been controversial, a common theme in the current backlash against FTAs is the perception that past FTAs have not provided the economic benefits promised by policymakers at the time of their signing. Since the broader trend towards ever larger and more comprehensive trade deals seems unlikely to abate, the current moment thus offers an opportunity to take stock of the heterogeneous effects of past FTAs on bilateral trade flows ==== to see if these effects reflect the wisdom of established theory and to determine what lessons we can draw to better predict the effects of future FTAs ====.====The proliferation of new FTAs in recent years offers a useful historical lens for studying how trade agreements achieve liberalization that goes beyond the simple elimination of tariffs. Since 1986, there have been more than 350 new trade agreements notified to the WTO, which have differed in their aim, breadth, and scope. Broadly speaking, however, a shared objective of many of these agreements has been to achieve “deep” integration, i.e., economic integration that goes beyond tariff reduction and extends into policies that are more difficult for the econometrician to observe and to quantify. Leading econometric studies of the “average partial effect” of FTAs on trade, such as Baier & Bergstrand (2007) and Anderson & Yotov (2016), generally support this view, as the estimates they obtain appear too large to be explained by tariff reductions alone.====As a result, those wishing to model the effects of FTAs ==== face a fundamental problem: how to assess their initial, partial equilibrium impact on bilateral trade. If FTAs affect trade only through tariffs, this partial effect could be computed directly (assuming a constant elasticity). However, in combination, the small current levels of tariffs and the large FTA estimates from the existing literature support the conclusion that the effects of FTAs on bilateral trade go far beyond the simple elimination of tariffs. To allow for such possibilities, a growing number of researchers use econometric estimates of the ==== effects of existing FTAs (often just a single average estimate) as a proxy for the effects of future agreements.==== However, aside from variation in tariffs (or, more nebulously, in “non-tariff measures”, NTMs), few theoretically-grounded arguments exist for why these partial effects might differ systematically across different agreements.====Accordingly, the main goal of this paper is to develop methods and hypotheses that will identify meaningful, theoretically-motivated sources of variation for predicting the effects of trade deals ==== In particular, we pursue a “two stage” estimation procedure for quantifying and studying heterogeneity in the effects of FTAs, using data on trade and production for 70 countries over the period 1986–2006. In a first stage, we expand on the methods of Baier & Bergstrand (2007) and Bergstrand et al. (2015) to obtain agreement-specific effects for each FTA signed during the period, as well as “direction-of-trade”-specific estimates for each member pairing within a given agreement. This stage of the analysis delivers a total of 908 direction-specific, widely-varying FTA estimates, which we then use as dependent variables in a second stage that studies the determinants of the variance in the FTA estimates.====To help explain this heterogeneity, we seek guidance from theory. Specifically, we exploit the basic structure of a standard multi-country trade model to examine two novel sources of variation. First, to the extent that some trade frictions are induced by trade policies and domestic regulations, pairs of countries with higher levels of trade frictions ==== should have more potential for larger FTA partial effects ====. Second, drawing on the influential “terms of trade” arguments of Bagwell and Staiger, 1999, Bagwell and Staiger, 2005, countries with less “market power” over their own terms of trade should grant relatively smaller concessions when they sign FTAs, because they are likely already close to their “politically optimal” set of trade policies. To operationalize these insights, we introduce two indices: (i) a comprehensive index of “pre-FTA trade barriers”, which we obtain naturally from our econometric first stage model, and (ii) a simulated measure of each member of an agreement's “terms of trade sensitivity”, which, to emphasize the connection with the theories of Bagwell & Staiger, we also refer to as “revealed market power”. Our analysis finds robust support for both of these hypotheses.====We also confirm two other intuitively plausible hypotheses that can account for a fraction of the observed heterogeneity. First, countries with prior trade agreements already in place tend to have weaker partial effects from any subsequent agreements. Second, even after controlling for the level of existing trade frictions, FTA partial effects are weaker for countries which are further apart geographically. This may be because more distant countries are less sensitive to changes in trade policies (as emphasized in Baier et al., 2018) or perhaps because they find it more difficult to coordinate on deeper integration because of weaker cultural affinities.====One other variable that has been highlighted in the broader literature on FTAs also draws our interest. Following the work of Kehoe & Ruhl (2013) on the “new goods” margin of trade - as well as subsequent work by Kehoe et al. (2015) - we test whether countries that trade a relatively small range of products ==== have more potential for “explosive” trade creation after the signing of an FTA. Interestingly, we find that the number of products trade ==== is, if anything, ==== related to the amount of trade creation ====, seemingly contradicting these earlier findings. Two remarks help reconcile this discrepancy. First, to the extent that a low traded goods margin manifests itself in a “gravity” framework as high trade costs, our comprehensive index of “pre-FTA trade barriers” already takes this margin into account. Second, the distinction between “across-” versus “within-” agreement heterogeneity is again important here. In particular, when we restrict our focus to asymmetric FTA effects within the same pair of countries - better approximating the case study design used in Kehoe & Ruhl (2013) and Kehoe et al. (2015) - we do find that a low traded goods margin helps predict asymmetries in trade creation.====In light of recent trends towards larger multilateral trade blocs, an especially appealing aspect of our two stage approach is that we can easily narrow our focus to heterogeneous effects that might occur within individual agreements.==== Interestingly, we find that variation in FTA effects ==== different agreements (i.e., the difference between NAFTA and Mercosur) explains only about one-third of the variation in our first stage estimates of FTA effects. Of the remaining two-thirds, which are due to “within agreement” heterogeneity, almost half (i.e., almost one-third of the total) is due to asymmetric effects “within pairs”. With the exception of prior agreements, our key variables of interest remain relevant when we limit attention to heterogeneity within agreements. We are also specifically able to relate asymmetries in trade creation within pairs to differences in market power, as would be predicted by terms-of-trade theory.====We subject these insights to a battery of other controls that may be plausibly linked to trade creation, including “gravity” relationships, depth of the agreements, factor endowment differences, institutional frictions to trade, and ==== tariff policies. These additional regressions reveal several useful auxiliary findings. For example, we find that our preferred second stage model significantly outperforms observed tariffs in explaining the heterogeneity in our FTA estimates, especially when we consider heterogeneity “within agreements” and “within pairs”. Information on factor endowments and/or institutional development similarly only seems useful for predicting the heterogeneity that occurs across agreements; they are silent as to why the same agreement could have different effects for different members. We do, however, find robust evidence that FTA effects are larger for countries with larger economic size (GDP).====By design, our two stage approach is well-suited for developing and validating a model for making ==== predictions. Drawing on the machine learning literature, we use an “out of sample” prediction analysis to test if an empirical model fitted from the first stage estimates of one set of agreements can reliably predict the partial effects found in the excluded agreements.==== As an illustration, we use the predictive model developed from this out-of-sample analysis to generate unique, direction-of-trade-specific predicted partial effects of a hypothetical revived TTIP on trade between the U.S. and E.U. Compared with an alternate scenario in which TTIP has the same partial effect on all TTIP trade flows (as is typically assumed in other analyses), we find that allowing for heterogeneous partial effects has important consequences for how TTIP affects welfare, which follow directly from the empirical insights we document in the second stage analysis. In this way, our three-part approach offers a cohesive methodology for studying and predicting heterogeneous effects of FTAs: the first stage creates preliminary objects of interest, the second stage provides a thorough empirical deconstruction, and the third part demonstrates a novel method for making ==== predictions that highlights and validates the practical usefulness of the first two parts.====Naturally, our approach is complementary to the prevailing, non-econometric methods that have been used to model the effect of trade policies ====. Because FTAs have shifted their focus away from tariffs, applied work in the CGE literature increasingly aims to quantify the impact of non-tariff provisions of FTAs on so-called “non-tariff barriers”. However, as discussed in Fugazza & Maur (2008), because of the complexity of these issues, even the best-possible estimates of non-tariff barriers must be interpreted with caution and model results based on these estimates may be highly fragile to minor variations in methodology. Our methods admittedly lack the specificity of a fully-specified CGE framework. Nonetheless, we are able to identify several broad sources of variation in FTA effects that have been previously overlooked, have strong theoretical and intuitive appeal, and appear to have robust support in the data.====Lastly, because we allow FTA effects to differ by agreement, we also contribute to a longstanding literature that has examined the effects of individual agreements. This literature begins with the seminal work of Tinbergen (1962), who found only small effects for the Benelux and British Commonwealth preference arrangements, and also includes other influential studies by Frankel & Wei (1997) and Carrère (2006), who allow for differences across several major modern regional trading blocs. Methodologically, the most related work in this area is Kohl (2014), who observes that FTA effects may differ based on WTO membership and on the institutional quality of an agreement. By and large, these studies have not found that most FTAs have increased trade. For example, Kohl (2014) finds only 27% of FTAs have had positive and significant effects on trade. We, however, find positive effects for a majority (57%) of the agreements in our study. This could be for three reasons. First, we follow the econometric recommendations of Santos Silva & Tenreyro (2006) in using Poisson PML, as opposed to OLS, in order to account for heteroskedasticity of trade data and to be able to use the information contained in zero trade flows. Second, we include consistently-measured internal trade flows, which enable us to capture the possibility that increases in trade between liberalizing countries may actually be at the expense of internal trade.==== Third, bilateral trade flows may not instantaneously respond to the implementation of an FTA. To account for the phasing-in of different provisions and other adjustments that may accompany FTAs, we allow agreements to have lagged effects that accumulate over time.====The following section describes the first stage estimation procedure. Section 3 adds details on how we construct our data and key variables. Section 4 summarizes our first stage FTA estimates. These estimates are then used as the dependent variables in the second stage analysis, which is contained in Section 5. Section 6 uses the insights from the second stage to forecast the effects of TTIP. Finally, Section 7 adds concluding remarks.",On the widely differing effects of free trade agreements: Lessons from twenty years of trade integration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618304367,January 2019,2019,Research Article,279.0

Our first finding is that flexible prices were the most influential channel through which output was stabilized, whereas migration and ==== mattered little. Our second finding is that price flexibility was predicated on large primary sectors. Their flexibly priced products dominated the export booms that stabilized output during major external adjustments.","The pre-1914 Gold Standard (GS) was a global fixed exchange rate regime of colossal extent. By 1913 economies responsible for 67% of world GDP and 70% of world trade had relinquished flexible exchange rates as a means to unwind external imbalances. Yet, external adjustments were accompanied by few, if any, output losses (see Meissner and Taylor, 2006; Adalet and Eichengreen, 2007). How did the GS function so smoothly despite inflexible exchange rates? There are several competing explanations. First, the price level was flexible, allowing for a fast absorption of shocks (Backus and Kehoe, 1992; Basu and Taylor, 1999; Chernyshoff et al., 2009). Second, cyclical international migration helped turn around the current account and took pressure off wages in depressed regions (e.g. Hatton, 1995; Khoudour-Castéras, 2005). Finally, central banks could smooth out temporary disturbances by running down their reserves (see Bazot et al., 2014; Eichengreen and Flandreau, 2014) or by making use of the considerable monetary policy independence that the Gold Standard, as a target zone regime, afforded in the short run (Krugman, 1991; Svensson, 1994; Bordo and MacDonald, 2005). The purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative assessment of the importance of each of these channels. Can we determine which one reduced output volatility the most? Were they equally important? Were they only effective in combination? A better understanding of why output remained stable during external adjustments under the Gold Standard is particularly relevant in light of the large recessions that often accompany external adjustments in fixed exchange rate regimes today (see Eichengreen and Temin, 2010; O'Rourke and Taylor, 2013).====In order to quantitatively assess the importance of flexible prices, international migration and monetary policy we build an open-economy DSGE model of the GS. This model features international migration, various degrees of price flexibility and a GS-specific monetary structure. We estimate the model with Bayesian methods and study its behavior through counterfactual simulations. How would output volatility have looked had prices been less flexible? What if there had been no release through migration? How important was countercyclical monetary policy? The first main finding of this paper is that price flexibility was critical to the benign external adjustment experience under the Gold Standard. By contrast, neither restrictions on migration, nor the elimination of countercyclical monetary policy would have given rise to substantially higher output volatility.====The second main finding is that price flexibility and benign external adjustments were predicated on production and trade being concentrated in the primary sector. In general, agricultural products exhibited significantly more flexible prices than industrial or service goods. Prior to 1913, agricultural products made up the majority of all merchandise exports, even among early industrializers. The fact that the nominally most flexible sector also was the most important tradable sector is the main explanation for the ease of external adjustment under the pre-1913 Gold Standard. On the basis of newly collected disaggregate export, price, and production data, we show that Gold Standard economies experienced a pronounced shift in sectoral structure during current account reversals. Production shifted away from the non-tradables' sector (primarily services) towards the production of tradable agricultural goods. This sectoral shift was brought about by quickly falling agricultural prices that translated into a boom in agricultural exports.====A better understanding of how external adjustment worked under the Gold Standard is particularly interesting in light of the often costly adjustment experience in fixed exchange rate regimes today. For example, Fig. 1 compares external adjustments under the Gold Standard and the euro area. Under the Gold Standard as well as in the euro area the ==== to ==== (CA/GDP) ratio decreased on average by about 5 percentage points in the 10 years prior to its trough. However, while reversals were associated with major recessions in the euro area, under the Gold Standard output continued to grow on trend. Thus, external adjustments under the Gold Standard stand in sharp contrast to recent external adjustments in the euro area. Additionally, the pre-1913 Gold Standard lasted longer than most international fixed exchange rate regimes. Thus, it provides a unique opportunity to analyze external adjustment under fixed exchange rates for the same set of countries over more than three decades.====The paper is structured as follows: The following section introduces the data. After that, Section 3 presents an empirical outline of the behavior of prices, migration and monetary policy during major external adjustment episodes under the Gold Standard. Here we show that (i) a strong price-decline in regions facing a current account-reversal quickly increased their price competitiveness, (ii) migration flows redistributed labor supply from deficit regions to surplus regions, and (iii) central banks made use of the short-run independence they enjoyed under the Gold Standard. Sections 4 and 5 present the Gold Standard-model and its estimation. The relative importance of prices, migration and monetary policy are then analyzed on the basis of counterfactual model simulations in Section 6.

Many countries also require them to enter into joint ventures or licensing agreements with local producers in order to maximise efficiency gains at recipient firms. However, evidence is inconclusive on whether and how multinational activity affects productivity and competitiveness in host economies. Do foreign owners actually improve technical efficiency at acquired firms or are they driven more by considerations of market power? Does multinational activity generate efficiency gains regardless of ownership structure or are some ownership structures more beneficial to the local economy than others?====This paper aims to answer these questions and document how multinational ownership affects productivity, competition, and selection in the local economy. It has been a major challenge to isolate the productivity effects of multinational activity – and mergers and acquisitions (M&As) – from market power and selection considerations. Whenever M&As and multinational activity in an industry affect market power, relying on traditional estimates of productivity becomes misleading. For instance, acquisitions that increase market power tend to raise output prices, which is reflected as a productivity gain in a typical revenue-based measure even in the absence of changes to technical efficiency (Braguinsky et al. 2015).====We take advantage of a new dataset that helps us tackle well-known issues in the estimation of production functions and strip the effect of changes in market power on productivity. At the same time, our dataset provides variation in multinationals' ownership structure within plants and multinational activity within industries. This variation helps us document how multinationals affect measures of physical productivity, prices, and markups at acquired plants and the rest of the industry. We calculate alternative productivity measures that capture the role of capacity utilisation, inventory management, and within-industry price heterogeneity, which are typically confounded into more traditional estimates of efficiency. We then document how ownership structure of multinationals affects each of these components at investment targets and domestic plants operating in the same industries.====Our first set of findings documents the impact of multinational investment on acquired plants. Following acquisitions, revenue productivity at target plants rises by up to 9%. However, this figure masks considerable variation in the underlying components of revenue productivity. Target plants in fact see improvements in physical productivity by 13%, which is accompanied by a drop in real output prices by 4% on average. Their markups are only slightly higher following acquisition, suggesting that most of the cost-savings reflected by the rise in physical productivity is passed on to acquired plants' customers. A part of the post-acquisition effect is due to multinationals' targeting plants with relatively high levels of prices and markups prior to acquisition even within narrowly defined industries. Our results suggest that this selection effect accounts for less than a fifth of the observed differences in physical productivity in the post-acquisition period.====We extend our analysis by studying how ownership structure affects acquired plants. Physical efficiency gains and reductions in price are much higher in the case of majority-owned affiliates. When we tightly control for pre-acquisition characteristics, we find that most of the variation remains for plants that are majority owned by multinationals, but not for minority foreign-owned plants. This suggests that ownership structure affects how multinationals identify investment targets and what they change at acquired plants. We find that majority-owned affiliates are much more likely to start exporting and become importers of intermediate inputs following an acquisition. We also find that multinationals from countries that invest more in research and development (R&D) or that are members of the European Union (EU) increase physical productivity more than revenue productivity in the sample. These results are consistent with the view that ownership structure affects the degree of technology transfer and the distribution of gains from foreign direct investment (FDI) (Asiedu and Esfahani 2001). They also suggest that the effects may extend beyond the investment targets if the rest of the industry responds to price and employment dynamics due to multinational activity.====Our second set of findings goes in this direction and documents how multinationals impact on domestic plants operating in the same industry through horizontal spillovers. Acquired plants increase competition by lowering output prices. This is expected to have two effects. First, it may induce a price reduction at surviving domestic plants and a corresponding increase in physical efficiency to meet the profitability threshold for survival. Second, cutoff productivity for survival may increase and inefficient domestic businesses that cannot compete may be driven out.====Our results provide strong evidence for the first prediction. Greater presence of multinationals is associated with higher physical productivity and lower prices at domestic plants in the same industry, especially when multinational affiliates are majority-owned. Physical efficiency at domestic plants responds by a larger extent than the drop in price, which translates into positive but insignificant spillovers of revenue productivity. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that increased multinational activity accounts for just over 10% of the rise in average physical productivity of domestic plants over the sample period.====We also find suggestive evidence for the second prediction. Although estimates are noisy, domestic plants with higher physical productivity are more likely to survive, unless they operate in industries where multinationals are more prevalent, in which case a higher physical efficiency is less likely to ensure survival. Similarly, domestic plants charging higher output prices, presumably due to high demand for their products, are more likely to continue their operations on average. However, if they compete in the product and labour markets in an industry with high multinational presence, then higher prices do not lower the likelihood of exit by as much as they do in an industry with minimal multinational presence.====There are three separate theoretical frameworks that generate predictions consistent with these empirical findings. First, Shimomura and Thisse (2012) present a model in which a few big firms set prices strategically and compete with smaller firms that are unable to do so. Theoretically, they combine a Cournot oligopoly model with symmetrically differentiated products and a traditional monopolistic competition model in a so-called polarised industry. In the model, the entry of big firms leads them to sell more through a market expansion effect generated by the shrinking of the monopolistically competitive fringe. Big firms therefore have an incentive to lower prices and drive less efficient businesses out of the market, which leads to a reduction in the aggregate price index. As we show below, multinationals are typically big players in their industries and industry-level prices grow at a lower rate in industries with greater multinational presence.====Second, our results are in line with what Foster et al. (2016) call “demand accumulation by doing”: new entrants in a market may lower prices today to attract buyers and build a customer base at the expense of current profits. They build a dynamic model in which plants mark up price less over marginal cost than in a static world to induce extra sales today and shift out their demand curve tomorrow. We show below that majority foreign-owned affiliates, for which we find a strong negative price drop following an acquisition, are also those that experience a considerable increase in market share.====Third, Chevalier and Scharfstein (1996) show that liquidity constraints affect pricing behaviour in a model of product market competition in which firms need to raise external funds to finance operations and they price for market share. In particular, a positive liquidity event lowers the threat of default and thereby allows firms to reduce prices and build market share. In line with the suggestion that financial frictions affect pricing behaviour, we find that acquired plants lower their prices by more in industries that are more dependent on external finance. We find this pro-competitive effect to be especially strong when multinationals take a majority equity share, which provides firms a healthy financial injection.====We draw on the census of manufacturers in Turkey to document these results. The census has the advantage of reporting the exact equity share owned by foreign investors, allowing us to track ownership changes over time. A second advantage of the data is its wealth of information that allows us to estimate physical measures of productivity, also referred to as quantity-based productivity or technical efficiency in the literature. Separating physical productivity from the effect of prices is a major challenge that the literature on estimating production functions has sought to address. Even when prices on final goods are observed, variation in input prices across plants may lead to misestimation. Our dataset provides product-level records of physical units of inputs employed and output produced alongside their purchase and sale values. We take advantage of these data to construct appropriate product-level deflators and estimate measures of physical productivity, prices, and markups.====Our first contribution is to the literature on multinationals, productivity, and market power. We identify the sources of superior efficiency attributed to acquirers by separating a revenue-based productivity estimate into its price and physical productivity components for the entirety of a country's manufacturing sector. Working with census data is crucial to understand how acquirers select their investment targets, the mechanisms behind multinationals' efficiency advantage over domestic firms, and how aggregate productivity responds to FDI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to document a pro-competitive effect on prices and evidence on physical efficiency induced by multinational activity.====In addition to within-plant effects, we document how firm survival and reallocation due to multinational activity shapes industry productivity. Foster et al. (2008) show that revenue-based productivity measures understate the importance of reallocation and firm turnover to industry productivity growth. Our findings similarly point to a more prominent role of selection and reallocation between plants in explaining the effects of multinationals on aggregate productivity than previously thought. When revenue-based productivity is used, both the within-plant effect of multinational investment and the cross-effect on domestic plants in the industry are under-estimated.====Our second contribution is methodological. We generate productivity and markup estimates by tackling several issues highlighted in the literature at the same time. First, we use extremely rich product-level data on inputs and outputs to correct for the input price and output price biases. These biases arise due to the well-documented dispersion in prices across firms even within narrowly defined industries (Foster et al. 2008; Kugler and Verhoogen 2012; Atalay 2014). Second, we follow De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) and De Loecker et al. (2016) to correct for the simultaneous determination of productivity, ownership, and input demand, and the selection bias that may arise from using an unbalanced panel of single-product firms. Third, we use information on actual consumption of material inputs and final goods production, as opposed to reported material purchases and revenue from sales typically found in firm-level data. This isolates the effect of inventory management, which can help explain differences in measured productivity (Braguinsky et al. 2015).====Our work is related to the literature on the effects of acquisitions and multinational activity. A first strand of the literature looks at within-firm changes. Bragunisky et al. (2015) find that acquisitions improved both productivity and profitability in the Japanese cotton spinning industry. Sheen (2014) finds that prices fall significantly at target firms relative to the industry in a sample of mergers in the United States (U.S.), while Blonigen and Pierce (2016) show that domestic M&As in the U.S. raise markups but not productivity.==== A second strand of the literature looks at productivity spillovers to domestic firms and the role of ownership structure in explaining spillovers. In a seminal study, Aitken and Harrison (1999) document negative within-industry spillovers in Venezuela. In contrast, Haskel et al. (2007) and Keller and Yeaple (2009) document positive spillovers in the same industry in the United Kingdom and U.S., respectively.==== Javorcik (2004) and Javorcik and Spatareanu, 2008 fail to find within-industry spillovers, but they document positive spillovers in industries that supply to multinationals in Lithuania and Romania, respectively. They show the existence of spillovers only in the case of partially owned multinationals.====Our findings help reconcile these mixed results. They suggest that the first strand of the literature under-estimates within-firm productivity improvements of foreign acquisitions and the second strand under-estimates the cross-firm spillovers from multinational activity. With the exception of Braguinsky et al. (2015), these studies all use traditional revenue-based productivity estimates, which may partly explain estimates that are economically small.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 documents ownership structure patterns at multinationals in Turkey and discusses how they might affect economic outcomes. Section 3 describes the data and our empirical strategy.

We estimate the model's parameters to match bilateral trade flows across 66 countries as well as moments from the markup and sales distributions of Chilean firms. The model reconciles both micro and macro facts quantitatively, and yields ==== estimates that are in line with the existing literature. Hence, we conclude that the GCES model constitutes a plausible and parsimonious quantitative workhorse framework that can be used to analyze gains from trade.","The empirical international trade literature has documented several stylized facts that shed light on the role that heterogeneous firms play in shaping prices and flows of goods across borders. Bernard et al. (2003) and Bernard et al. (2012) document that exporters constitute a minority of producing plants but they enjoy a large productivity and size advantage over non-exporters. De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) show that more productive firms, and especially exporters, extract higher mark-ups than less productive ones, while Simonovska (2015) finds that a typical exporter enjoys higher mark-ups in richer over poorer destinations. Finally, Arkolakis (2010) and Mrazova et al. (2015) highlight that the size distribution of firms includes a Pareto right tail and the existence of many small exporters. Reconciling these facts proves to be important for the quantification of gains from trade as derived in Arkolakis et al. (2018).====We outline a theoretical framework that can reconcile these facts, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, we analyze a general equilibrium model of international trade that features monopolistically competitive heterogeneous firms and identical consumers whose preferences are represented by a generalized CES (GCES) utility function—Dixit-Stiglitz utility with displaced origin. According to the model, the marginal utility that each consumer derives from positive consumption is bounded, which implies the existence of a choke price above which demand is zero. Hence, only firms with sufficiently high productivity draws that offer their products at prices below the choke price survive in a given market, and the marginal firm realizes zero sales. Within a market, firms charge variable markups, but the markup of the most productive firms is bounded above by the familiar Dixit-Stiglitz markup. Iceberg trade barriers raise the cost to serve foreign markets, which implies that a subset of productive firms constitute the set of exporters. These firms enjoy an advantage in sales and measured value added over non-exporters, while constituting a minority when trade barriers are high. In turn, for the majority of exporters, high trade barriers erode foreign relative to domestic sales. Finally, consumers that reside in countries characterized by higher income levels are less responsive to price changes than those that live in poorer ones, so firms optimally price identical products higher in more affluent markets.====Having reconciled theory and fact, we examine the ability of the model to quantitatively account for the observations in the data. Under the assumption that firm productivities are Pareto distributed, the framework falls within the class of models investigated in Arkolakis et al. (2018) (ACDR); therefore, it is easily quantifiable.==== We rely on the model's predicted gravity equation of trade as well as bilateral trade-flow data for 66 countries to uncover all, but two of, the parameters necessary to simulate moments at the firm level. The two key remaining parameters constitute the Pareto shape parameter and the utility curvature parameter. We identify these parameters by matching moments from the sales and markup distributions for the universe of Chilean domestic and exporting firms.====The fact that the model falls within the non-homothetic class of models studied in ACDR is important because the same key model parameters that drive welfare are those that ensure the quantitative fit of the model to cross-sectional data. Yet, the nature of our quantitative exercise is different than ACDR's. While ACDR compare welfare gains from trade between homothetic and non-homothetic models for a given ==== trade elasticity and given aggregate trade data, we parameterize our non-homothetic model so as to reconcile aggregate trade observations as well as sales and markup distributions observed in the data. The ACDR welfare results rely on two structural parameters: the shape parameter of the productivity distribution and the revenue-weighted average elasticity of markups with respect to marginal costs. Since the sales and markup distributions contain information about these two parameters, we argue that our model's ability to match moments from these distributions is essential for quantifying welfare and running counterfactuals. We do not calculate the welfare gains from trade – the formula is derived in ACDR – but instead we estimate the parameters necessary to compute the gains from a counterfactual reduction in the domestic consumption share and we examine the implications of these estimates for a number of micro- and macro-level moments in cross-country data.====We find that the GCES model performs very well with respect to both micro and macro data; hence, it represents a plausible quantitative framework that can be used to study the welfare gains from trade in the presence of pro-competitive effects. While the framework's aggregate outcomes are easily quantifiable, the model does not yield analytical representations of firm-level variables. We provide an algorithm to take this model to the data that requires minimal computational costs. A natural question, however, is whether existing non-homothetic frameworks that share key qualitative predictions with the GCES model represent equally plausible alternatives. In particular, Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) (MO), Behrens et al. (2014) (BMMS), and Simonovska (2015) (SIM) offer frameworks that share the supply-side structure of the GCES model but rely on different utility functions.==== Therefore, when framed in a multi-country general equilibrium setting, these models are qualitatively in line with the price discrimination facts described above. If, in addition, the MO model is parameterized appropriately, the three models satisfy the assumption of separable preferences so that the choke prices in all the models are proportional to the one generated by the GCES.==== Hence, for a given Pareto shape parameter value, all models—existing as well as GCES—yield identical productivity cutoffs and macro aggregates.====Given a unique set of gravity variables and choke price that can be computed for all the models, we show that the three existing models cannot jointly account for the observed moments in the sales and markup distributions, unlike the flexible GCES model. We demonstrate theoretically that, in general equilibrium with free entry and under the assumption that firm productivity is Pareto distributed, a single parameter, the Pareto shape parameter, governs the sales and markup distributions in the three existing non-homothetic models. In those models, markups are unbounded which limits the sales of superstar firms. Alternatively, in the GCES, the markups of the largest firms approach a constant determined by the demand curvature parameter. Consequently, the existing models cannot reconcile observed behavior of the largest firms and yield different predictions about price dispersion and ultimately quantitative measures of welfare than the GCES model. In particular, when the models attempt to match the heterogeneity in sales and markup data, the resulting Pareto shape parameter and revenue-weighted markup elasticity are mismeasured, which highlights the need for a flexible parameterization such as the GCES.====With the above discussion in mind, a natural question arises: why focus the analysis on these particular moments in the data? First, the cross-section of sales and markups have constituted core moments traditionally examined by the quantitative trade literature of micro-level heterogeneity (see Bernard et al. (2003), Arkolakis (2010), and Behrens et al. (2014) among others). Second, a unification of the two distributions has proven elusive. CES frameworks are successful on the sales side, but do not generate price discrimination. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing non-homothetic frameworks that are consistent with firm pricing behavior cannot generate the very large sales of the most productive firms seen in data.==== Finally, as argued above, moments from these distributions directly speak to the key parameters that govern welfare in a non-homothetic model (see ACDR).==== Nonetheless, for robustness: i) we evaluate the performance of the GCES along a number of other dimensions in the data; ii) in order to provide meaningful comparisons to the literature that estimates trade elasticities, we explore an alternative estimation that relies on micro-level price data similar in spirit to Simonovska and Waugh (2014b), but modified accordingly to account for non-homothetic preferences.====Focusing on additional moments in the data for a cross-section of firms, we evaluate several predictions of the model. Using parameters estimated to match moments from the sales and markup distributions, the revenue-weighted pass-through of costs to markups is between 0.4 and 0.48, within the range documented by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) and De Loecker et al. (2016). Further, the model yields average markups between 13 and 26% – consistent with the markups we find in Chile. Focusing on exporters, as documented by Simonovska (2015), there is a positive relationship between prices of tradable goods and destination per-capita income, although our estimated elasticity of price with respect to income is higher than the one reported in the data.==== Relatedly, the minority of firms are exporters and the majority of these exporters sell mostly domestically, although we do not match the percent of firms that export due to our simple gravity-based trade-barrier estimation strategy which relies on bilateral trade data only. We outline estimation strategies that could match the number of exporters, but require additional data that we do not have access to. Finally, we compare our benchmark estimation results that target distributional moments to an alternative strategy that relies only on micro-level price data to match the trade elasticity. This yields an estimate for the Pareto shape parameter that is similar to our benchmark as well as to results found in the trade-elasticity literature, notably in Simonovska and Waugh (2014b).====Overall, the GCES model fits the data better than existing non-homothetic frameworks. In the GCES model, sales follow a Pareto distribution in the right tail, and there exist a large number of very small (in fact infinitesimally so) firms as in the data. We also outline shortcomings that apply to the use of a Pareto distribution in the quantitative analysis. For a given Pareto shape parameter, the model matches one important moment from the sales distribution–the ratio of average domestic sales of exporters relative to non-exporters. To simultaneously target multiple moments of the empirical sales distribution, we conduct an over-identified estimation that further targets the ratio of sales for firms in the upper percentiles relative to firms in lower percentiles. The strategy yields a larger productivity dispersion and a higher substitution parameter relative to the exactly-identified benchmark. It under-predicts the size advantage of the firms in the 90th relative to the 10th percentile, but over-predicts the size advantage of exporters over non-exporters.==== The short-comings exemplified by this exercise motivate an avenue for future research: to explore non-homothetic demand along with more flexible productivity distributions.====We contribute to a large and important literature that emphasizes the role that heterogeneous firms play in shaping international prices and trade flows. Most notably, to reconcile the documented facts about US exporters, BEJK develop a model in which suppliers with heterogeneous productivities compete within and across countries à la Bertrand and sell to consumers with homothetic (CES) preferences. A key prediction of the model is that, on average, more efficient suppliers have greater cost advantage over their rivals, set higher mark-ups, sell more and enjoy higher measured productivity.==== The models examined in the present paper are distinct from theirs in that consumer preferences are assumed to be non-homothetic and the market structure is monopolistically competitive. These two features allow us to derive testable predictions about individual firms' price discrimination practices within and across countries.====Finally, our paper relates to a large literature that quantitatively examines the role of heterogeneous firms in the global economy. Most notably, the workhorse model by Melitz (2003), parameterized as in Chaney (2008), features firms with heterogeneous productivity levels that incur fixed domestic and (in addition) export market access costs,thus accounting for the size and productivity advantage of exporters over non-exporters. Dispensing with the Melitz (2003) fixed market access cost formulation and incorporating into the model Arkolakis's (2010) advertising technology that allows firms to reach only a fraction of consumers in each market enables the framework to rationalize the co-existence of few exporters with exporters' tiny sales per export market. In addition, recent studies such as Bas et al. (2017), Sager and Timoshenko (2017), and Fernandes et al. (2017) examine more flexible productivity distributions to rationalize observed export sales moments. The unifying feature of these models is the assumption that consumer preferences are of the homothetic (CES) form. The formulation makes the models tractable, but it yields the theoretical prediction that firms charge identical prices across different destinations, net of trade costs. However, Waugh (2010) relies on the gravity equation of trade predicted by a large class of models, including the ones described above, and shows that, if trade costs are estimated from bilateral trade data, they are, at best, uncorrelated with destination income. This implies that the models yield no systematic link between a country's level of development and prices of tradables, which is at odds with the data. In contrast, the GCES model rationalizes the existence of small exporters via non-homothetic preferences, which also yield predictions about the cross-section of prices that are in line with data.====We organize the remainder of the paper as follows. We outline the supply side of the economy in Section 2. In that section, we also outline the GCES model and go on to derive important predictions in line with the current heterogeneous-firm literature. We compare these to the existing non-homothetic models in Section 3. We describe the solution algorithm for the GCES model and we generate moments for estimation in Section 4. In Section 5 we quantify the GCES model and analyze the fit to micro and macro data.

Divisionalization reduces the incentives for diversification in production. The extensive margins of trade expand as a result of divisionalization, facilitating specialization toward the direction of comparative advantage, with exports rising in the case of domestic divisionalization and imports rising in the case of foreign divisionalization. This effect of internal competition on specialization is magnified when competition between divisions is staggered. The factor market effects of divisionalization, domestic and/or foreign, strengthen the expansionary effects on the extensive margins of trade.","How does divisionalization affect international trade? Since multi-divisional firms are common in many industries that produce tradable goods and have implications for antitrust policies, it is not surprising that strategic use of divisionalization by firms producing similar goods, within as well as across borders, has drawn significant academic attention.==== Historically, while the practice of divisionalization dates back to Chrysler's opening its Plymouth division in 1928, corporations spearheading the multidivisional form of organization as an effective strategy for expansion include Allied Chemical, DuPont, General Electric, General Motors, Sears, Roebuck, Standard Oil, and Westinghouse. Conventional wisdom on divisionalization was limited to considerations of firms filling price niches by selling a variety of products to different classes of consumers. The rise of the multidivisional corporations led Williamson (1982) and Chandler (1992) to identify divisionalization as the most noteworthy organizational innovation of the 20th century: the modern multinational corporation is but a variant of the basic principles guiding divisionalization.====While traditional models of divisionalization could only provide limited insight, a relatively recent strand of literature looks into how market competition interacts with the firms' mode of organization in general equilibrium. For illustration, Marin and Verdier (2008) extended the construct of Aghion and Tirole (1997) on firm organization to identify the interaction between a firm's mode of organization on the one hand and market competition on the other hand in a general equilibrium framework. Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) study the implications of the internal organization of firms for access to markets via trade. However, these constructs rely on product differentiation and are silent about multidivisional firms selling products that are close substitutes. In comparison, Schwartz and Thompson (1986), Veendorp (1991), Polasky (1992), Baye et al. (1996), Creane and Davidson (2004), and Erickson (2012)) have enriched our understanding of how multinational corporations find it profitable to create intra-firm competition by cloning horizontal divisions within the firm. For instance, a 2015 report of the U.S. Department of Commerce reveals that Ford Motor Co. began shipping Lincoln vehicles from the Port of Portland to China in September 2014==== Lincoln's exports to China tripled from 2015 to 2016 while exports of Ford Taurus to China reached record levels in December of 2016.==== As Baye et al. (1996) had pointed out, internal divisions of Taurus and====Lincoln within Ford Motor Company produce effectively the same car. Analogous are instances of Chrysler Corporation's divisions creating Plymouth Voyager and the Dodge Caravan, two mini-vans that are virtually identical and sell at comparable prices, exports of which began as early as 1988. As Creane and Davidson (2004) pointed out, firms often create divisions (e.g. Chrysler created its Plymouth division) and, at the same time, parent companies add new divisions by merging with or acquiring a rival (e.g. Chrysler acquired its Dodge division in the same year that it created Plymouth by buying out Dodge Brothers, Inc.). Such strategic divisionalization in homogeneous goods has accompanied internationalization as multinational corporations expand their global reach by establishing subsidiaries in overseas locations administered by international division.====Table1 above illustrates the international scope of divisionalization reflected in a recent cross-country survey of 351 corporations spanning Anglo-American, Continental European, Asian, and developing economies.====With this backdrop, we build what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first general equilibrium model that parsimoniously links international trade and divisionalization in general equilibrium. Our main results are:====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we place our contribution in the context of relevant literature.

As these severe net capital outflows result in considerable downward pressure on the exchange rate, a natural policy regime to focus attention on in the context of such shocks is that of the exchange rate regime (ERR). The relevance of the type of ERR in place for the amplification or moderation of global credit supply shocks' real effects is of particular importance in emerging market economies (EMEs), whose net capital outflow during credit bust episodes and prevalence of foreign currency-denominated debt are both much stronger than their advanced economies' counterparts (see, e.g., Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2018)).====The two main transmission channels of exchange rate depreciation are the expansionary classical expenditure-switching channel and the (potentially) contractionary balance sheet channel, where the latter channel's ultimate direction of effect can in theory become even expansionary if the asset side of economic agents' balance sheets gains more from depreciation than their liabilities' side loses. Nevertheless, in theory, the total effect of these two channels can be either contractionary or expansionary, owing to the potentially contractionary effect of the balance sheet channel in the presence of foreign currency-denominated debt.==== The empirical questions this paper tries to address are the following: ====) are the contractionary effects of global credit supply shocks more adverse in EMEs that have fixed exchange rate regimes (ERRs)?; ====) which exchange rate channel dominates the other?; and ====) is the balance-sheet channel expansionary or contractionary? To address these questions, I employ a state-of-the-art, widely used de-facto ERR classification measure originally developed by Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) and updated by Ilzetzki et al. (2017) through 2016 (henceforth IRR). Its construction makes use of monthly data on market-determined parallel exchange rates to generate a fine classification of ERRs comprising of 15 categories. These categories appear in Table 1, where larger category integers represent more flexible ERRs. To divide the observations in my sample into fixed and non-fixed ERRs, I define categories 1–4 as corresponding to a fixed ERR and categories 5–13 as belonging to the non-fixed ERR, removing from the analysis categories 14–15 to ensure my results are not biased by severe inflationary periods and/or missing parallel market data. Categories 1–4 effectively correspond to pegged ERRs, while higher categories represent regimes in which there is more exchange rate flexibility. (The coarse classification of Ilzetzki et al. (2017) groups categories 1–4 into one category on the premise that they indeed represent fixed ERRs whereas higher categories (e.g., 5–8 and 9–12) begin to reflect cases of different degrees of limited flexibility.)====To measure the effects of global credit supply shocks, I make use of the Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) credit supply shock series.==== Their shock series serves as an exogenous and common global credit supply shock to EMEs; as such, the Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) series can be employed to study whether fixed ERRs amplify global credit supply shocks' adverse effects.==== I then integrate the ERR and credit supply shock data with quarterly frequency macroeconomic data of 40 EMEs and estimate nonlinear, dynamic fixed-effects panel regressions to study whether the effect of global credit supply shocks differs across peggers and non-peggers. Furthermore, I employ the Jorda (2005) local projections approach in the panel regression specification so as to be able to directly estimate the nonlinear, state-dependent impulse responses to global credit supply shocks.====My empirical findings can be summarized as follows. There is a statistically significant negative difference between the response of output in the fixed ERR state and the non-fixed one. This difference is also economically significant. Specifically, the peak output decline in the fixed ERR state takes place after two years reaching −2.7%, compared to −1.5% in the non-fixed ERR state, reflecting a t-statistic of −3.7 associated with the response difference between the two states. Both investment and consumption also decline significantly more in the fixed ERR. And there is a significantly stronger rise in the trade balance in the fixed ERR state, with both exports and imports declining significantly more in this state.====To shed light on the mechanism behind these results, I turn my analysis to exchange rates, leverage, stock prices, capital flows, and country credit spreads data. I first demonstrate, using market-determined parallel exchange rate data from Ilzetzki et al. (2017), that exchange rates do not move significantly in the fixed ERR while significantly depreciating in the non-fixed ERR. Then, using data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on cross-border credit, I demonstrate that the GDP share of debt owed to international banks falls by much more in the fixed ERR than in the non-fixed ERR. Moreover, stock prices also fall by much more in the fixed ERR, indicating that the asset side of firms' balance sheets declines by more in the fixed ERR. These results on leverage and stock prices, coupled with those on the stronger decline in imports in the fixed ERR state, are consistent with models with occasionally binding collateral constraints where imports are financed by debt and the asset side of economic agents' balance sheets is sufficiently positively affected by exchange rate depreciation so as to overturn the adverse depreciation effect on the liability side, thus ultimately resulting in an expansionary balance sheet channel of exchange rate depreciation (see, e.g., Devereux and Yu (2017)). In line with this interpretation, I also show that capital outflows in the fixed ERR are much more acute than in the non-fixed ERR and that country credit spreads rise by much more in the fixed ERR.==== Milton Friedman, more than 60 years ago, was the first to put forward the notion that flexible exchange rates can serve as shock absorbers (Friedman (1953)). His focus was on the classical expenditure-switching effect of exchange rate depreciation, which is also at the core of traditional models such as the open economy Mundell-Fleming framework as well its micro-founded, dynamic successor, the New Keynesian (NK) Open Economy model.====More sophisticated recently developed models focus on the shock-amplifying nature of fixed ERRs in the presence of downward nominal wage rigidly, where the lack of currency depreciation following an adverse shock enhances the increase in unemployment due to lack of downward adjustment in real wages (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2013, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2014, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2016). In models containing financial frictions, the shock-amplifying nature of fixed ERRs becomes less conclusive in theory due to the adverse balance sheet effect of currency depreciations in the presence of foreign currency-denominated debt.====Ottonello (2015) extends the framework developed by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2013, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2014, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2016 by adding an occasionally binding collateral constraint that is based on current income, as in Mendoza (2002). His setting produces a contractionary balance sheet channel of currency depreciation because the latter leads to a reduction in the foreign currency value of income derived from the non-tradable sector, thus tightening the collateral constraint and exacerbating financial frictions. Nevertheless, currency depreciation is still superior to no depreciation as its favorable effect on labor markets turns out to be stronger than its adverse balance sheet effect. Fornaro (2015) also assumes nominal wage rigidities that assign a shock-absorbing role to flexible exchange rates through real wage adjustment as well as an occasionally binding collateral constraint but differs from Ottonello (2015) in using a different constraint that is based on the foreign currency value of the household's capital (land), similar to Mendoza (2010). In this setting currency depreciation actually relaxes the collateral constraint through its favorable effect on capital prices, thus resulting in an expansionary balance sheet channel of currency depreciation which enhances the amplification of financial crises in a fixed ERR.====There have also been papers using models that incorporated both the classical expenditure-switching channel as well as the balance-sheet channel of exchange rate depreciation. Assuming financial frictions based on the costly state verification framework, Cspedes et al. (2004) and Gertler et al. (2007) stress that currency depreciation can have an expansionary effect on firms' balance sheets owing to its favorable effect on their asset side; and Devereux and Yu (2017) show a similar result assuming financial frictions resulting from an occasionally binding collateral constraint that is based on the foreign currency value of the borrower's capital.====Notwithstanding the rather vast theoretical work cited above, there has been fairly limited empirical work on the relation between ERRs and adverse shocks' effects.==== The papers that have looked at the general shock-amplifying nature of fixed ERRs relative to non-fixed ERRs can be divided into two strands: ====) one which has studied the shock-amplifying nature of fixed ERRs indirectly, i.e., not by conditioning on a particular identified shock, and ====) one that has done so directly but by focusing on aspects of the regime's shock-amplifying nature that are not explicitly related to global credit supply shocks.====The first strand of the literature has been initiated by Edwards (2004), who shows that more fixed ERRs generate more adverse effects of current account reversals on output growth. While there is a positive relation between current account reversals and sudden stops (sharp capital flow reversals), this relation is quite imperfect; as reported by Edwards (2004), more than 50% of the sudden stops in his sample are not related to current account reversals. Moreover, his analysis is mostly static, focusing on the effect of current account reversals on impact while ignoring the potentially interesting dynamics of this effect. Hence, the results of Edwards (2004) have limited informativeness for the relation between ERRs and global credit supply shocks' effects.====Subsequent works belonging to this strand of literature have focused on the current account as their main outcome variable. Chinn and Wei (2013) show that EMEs that move from a fixed regime to a less fixed regime do not necessarily benefit from a more rapid adjustment of the current account; rather than measuring the type of ERR with de facto regime measures, Ghosh et al. (2013) use a trade-weighted bilateral exchange rate volatility measure to characterize the level of exchange rate flexibility and find that flexible exchange rates imply less persistent current account dynamics. While these two papers have not explicitly controlled for the occurrences of sudden stops, Eguren-Martin (2016) compares the speed of current account adjustment across ERRs while explicitly accounting for the occurrence of sudden stops, finding that flexible exchange rates deliver a faster current account adjustment among EMEs. Although useful for our understanding of the mean-reverting behavior of the current account and thus its ability to adjust in response to its reduced form innovations, these papers (much like the paper of Edwards (2004)) do not directly shed light on the role of fixed ERRs in amplifying global credit supply shocks' adverse effects because the latter innovations are essentially combinations of various structural shocks, some of which are likely non-credit-supply type shocks.====The second strand includes Broda (2004) and Edwards and Levy-Yeyati (2005), who examine the effects of terms of trade shocks as a function of the ERR; di Giovanni and Shambaugh (2008), who study the effects of foreign interest rate shocks as a function of the ERR; Born et al. (2013) and Ilzetzki et al. (2013), who look at the relation between ERRs and the effects of fiscal policy shocks on output; and Adler and Mora (2012), who run static regressions of output growth on VIX interacted with ERR. All papers generally find that a fixed ERR amplifies the effects of the respective shocks they consider. However, the first three shocks are likely to be quite different from global credit supply shocks in terms of their structural interpretation and the types of effects they produce.====Even foreign interest rate shocks, which are more financial in nature than the other two shocks, are insufficient proxies for global credit supply shocks from a structural standpoint. Underlying this insufficiency is that, unlike foreign interest rate shocks, global credit supply shocks directly speak to the exacerbation of financial frictions facing both foreign and domestic borrowers by being a structural feature of the agency problem encapsulating these frictions. E.g., Ueda (2012) models adverse global credit supply shocks as declines in net worth of global financial intermediaries and Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2018) study a favorable global credit supply shock that loosens a global financial intermediary's balance sheet constraint; both of these modeling approaches stress the tight link between global credit supply shocks and the availability of credit supply at both the global and domestic levels, with adverse such shocks leading to an exacerbation of financial fictions and consequent decline in credit supply available to borrowers. While the effects of contractionary foreign monetary policy shocks may partly propagate to the domestic economy through worsening credit conditions, the core of their structural modeling does not lie in the agency problem between borrowers and lenders as is the case for global credit supply shocks.====As for the VIX shock, while it is true that movements in this variable capture in part financial shocks, one may also argue that they also capture other, non-financial shocks such as U.S. technology and policy shocks given the potential endogeneity of the VIX measure.==== Hence, one advantage of my analysis is the use of a more structural shock that more clearly represents global credit supply shocks. Two additional important advantages are as follows. First, I perform a dynamic analysis that allows for the estimation of ERR-dependent impulse responses. Second, my analysis looks at various additional variables beyond the output outcome variable so as to learn about the mechanism driving my results.==== The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I begin with a description of the data, after which the methodology and main empirical evidence are presented. Section 3 examines the robustness of the results to alternative specifications.

This condition and other related provisions governing PTAs are specified in Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the key multilateral agreement governing international trade in goods amongst WTO members. This paper develops a model of endogenous trade agreements to investigate the welfare implications of this ==== facing PTAs at the WTO as well as the effect it has on the likelihood of achieving global free trade. In the existing literature, Article XXIV has often been invoked as a justification for the ==== that PTA members impose zero tariffs on each other. Though reasonable, this approach masks the incentives underlying the tariff-setting behavior of PTA members and, by design, fails to shed light on the consequences of requiring them to fully liberalize internal trade.====We focus on free trade agreements (FTAs), the most commonly occurring type of PTA in today's global economy. Our conceptual approach to the formation of trade agreements follows Saggi and Yildiz (2010) who develop an equilibrium theory of FTAs in a modified version of the three-country competing exporters framework of Bagwell and Staiger (1999a).==== Assuming FTA members impose zero tariffs on one another, they compare the relative merits of bilateralism and multilateralism as alternative routes to global trade liberalization. Although the WTO system sanctions discrimination in the specific form of PTAs, it also requires all member countries to grant most favored nation (MFN) status to one another which generally forbids discrimination on their part. Thus, we begin with a ==== scenario under which FTA members are required to eliminate tariffs on each other and the non-member is obligated to follow the MFN principle of non-discrimination when setting its tariffs on FTA members. We compare this WTO-consistent benchmark with a scenario of ==== wherein FTA members have the freedom to implement jointly optimal internal tariffs as opposed to having to eliminate them as a precondition for forming the FTA.====A comparison of the WTO-consistent scenario with the unconstrained preferential liberalization scenario delivers several interesting results. First, we show that if FTA members choose internal tariffs to maximize their joint welfare, they indeed have an incentive to impose positive tariffs on one another. The intuition for this surprising result rests on the interplay between two mechanisms: the ==== between FTA members and the ====. Since FTA members set their external tariffs independently, each member fails to take into account the benefits that its external tariff confers on its partner – if an FTA member raises its tariff on the non-member, exports of its FTA partner to its market increase while those of the non-member decrease. Thus, because each FTA member ignores the impact of its external tariff on the welfare of its partner, the individually optimal external tariffs of FTA members are too low from the perspective of maximizing their joint welfare.====The existence of tariff complementarity and the lack of external tariff coordination together imply that, while coordinating their internal tariffs, FTA members deliberately choose to set positive internal tariffs on each other: doing so commits each of them to a higher external tariff on the non-member country thereby bringing their individually optimal external tariffs closer to jointly optimal ones. To confirm the role that external tariff coordination plays in generating positive internal tariffs within an FTA, we consider a setting where FTA members can coordinate their external as well as internal tariffs, as they might be able to do under a customs union (CU). Under such a case, members indeed find it optimal to engage in free internal trade. This result suggests that the free internal trade requirement of Article XXIV is likely to be more binding for FTAs relative to CUs.==== Although there is some evidence that FTAs tend to have more excluded sectors than CUs, there is a lack of comprehensive empirical evidence on internal tariffs and excluded sectors in FTAs and CUs.==== Freund and Ornelas (2010) highlight the wide range of implementation rates of PTAs as a vital research area that has received little attention.====The second major insight delivered by our analysis is that requiring FTA members to eliminate internal tariffs ==== the non-member since it leads to ==== external tariffs on the part of FTA members. This result, driven by tariff complementarity, is noteworthy since part of the original intent behind the design of Article XXIV may have been to minimize any potential negative effects of FTAs on non-member countries. Ostensibly, this objective was met by prohibiting FTA members from raising their external tariffs on outsiders. However, in our model, FTA members have no incentive to increase their external tariffs on the non-member country anyway.==== Thus, the Article XXIV stipulation that FTA members cannot raise tariffs on outsiders may actually do little to protect the interests of outsiders. The idea that the requirement of free internal trade amongst FTA members could imply ==== was probably unforeseen at the time the relevant GATT rules were crafted. Instead, it seems more likely that the requirement of zero internal tariffs was designed to promote trade creation amongst FTA members. Our analysis demonstrates that, somewhat surprisingly, it is the Article XXIV requirement of free internal trade within an FTA that ends up protecting the non-member as opposed to the restriction imposed on the external tariffs of FTAs.====Our third major result pertaining to the free internal trade requirement of Article XXIV is that having such a requirement makes it ==== to achieve global free trade. The logic for this result is as follows. By lowering the external tariffs of FTA members, the free internal trade requirement of Article XXIV makes it ==== attractive for the non-member to enter into trade agreements with them – by staying out, it remains free to impose its optimal import tariffs while facing relatively lower tariffs in the markets of FTA countries due to the disciplining force of the free internal trade requirement.==== Thus, the free internal trade requirement of Article XXIV might facilitate some degree of ==== in the WTO system by allowing non-member countries to benefit from reductions in external tariffs of FTA members (that result from their internal trade liberalization) ==== having to offer any tariff cuts of their own. Thus, our overall message is somewhat nuanced: when circumstances are such that achieving global free trade is not possible, the free internal trade requirement of Article XXIV increases world welfare by lowering tariffs world-wide but, at the same time, it also reduces the likelihood of reaching global free trade.====In Section 5 of the paper we show that our results are robust to two alternative tariff setting scenarios and to a fairly wide range of endowment asymmetry across countries. First, we relax the assumption that countries seeking to form FTAs set their MFN tariffs non-cooperatively since WTO members do seem to cooperate in the setting of their MFN tariffs even though such cooperation is hardly perfect. To this end, we allow countries to engage in a limited degree of cooperation by assuming that they assign some weight to the welfare of other countries while setting their MFN tariffs. We show that our main results regarding the impact of the free internal trade requirement continue to hold even when countries do not set their tariffs in a fully non-cooperative manner. In our second robustness exercise, we indirectly address the issue of the ==== of the free internal trade provision of Article XXIV. We do this by examining a scenario where Article XXIV imposes a ceiling on the internal tariffs of an FTA. Under such a scenario, we show that the free riding incentive continues to be the pivotal force in determining the prospects of global free trade: the tighter the ceiling imposed on the internal tariffs of FTAs (i.e. the more it binds), the lower the external tariffs of FTA members. A lower ceiling brings us closer to the free internal trade scenario, making it ==== attractive for the non-member to enter into trade agreements with FTA members which in turn undermines global free trade. Finally, we demonstrate that our main results extend to the case when all three countries are asymmetric, unlike our benchmark case wherein two countries are fully symmetric.====Since Bhagwati (1991), the literature has paid significant attention to whether PTAs serve as ==== or ==== blocs for multilateral trade liberalization. Early theoretical research on this issue generally took PTAs to be exogenously given and focused on how PTA membership affects the incentives that countries have for participating in multilateral trade liberalization (see, for example, Krishna, 1998; Ornelas, 2005a, Ornelas, 2005b). More recent studies, such as Goyal and Joshi (2006), Aghion et al. (2007), Taiji and Konishi (2007), and Seidmann (2009) consider endogenous PTAs but ignore the possibility of trade liberalization on an MFN basis. Under this approach, PTAs are seen as building blocs so long as their pursuit eventually leads to global free trade. However, Saggi and Yildiz (2010), Saggi et al. (2013), Missios et al. (2016) and Stoyanov and Yildiz (2015) have argued that PTAs ought to be seen as building blocks only if the freedom to pursue PTAs (granted to WTO members by GATT Article XXIV) is ==== for achieving global free trade. An attractive feature of this line of research is that it treats both preferential and multilateral liberalization as being endogenous. This paper follows this approach and furthers the literature on the building versus stumbling bloc question by showing that the free internal trade requirement of Article XXIV makes it harder to achieve global free trade, i.e., it reduces the likelihood that PTAs act as building blocs.====The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we introduce our competing exporters model of trade between three countries. Section 3 outlines the main policy scenarios we investigate: the WTO-consistent scenario where FTA members are required to engage in free internal trade and the unrestricted preferential liberalization scenario where members are free to impose non-zero internal tariffs on one another. In section 4, we solve for the equilibrium outcome for both of these policy scenarios and compare their differences. Section 5 confirms the robustness of our results via three important extensions and Section 6 concludes.",Should the WTO require free trade agreements to eliminate internal tariffs?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618304185,May 2019,2019,Research Article,285.0

The empirical analysis is based on micro data of German firms and their operations at home and abroad, including information on investment in fixed assets. The empirical approach, which rests upon extensive and intensive margin variation, is shown to produce very robust results. These suggest a positive relationship between foreign and home investment in real capital. This positive effect seems to be mainly related to additional opportunities for tax planning and better access to financing capital. In contrast, we do not find evidence that improved production processes and technology upgrading cause the positive effect on investment at home. Our empirical approach allows us to distinguish between an extensive and intensive margin effect: setting up a new foreign affiliate leads to an immediate positive effect of about EUR 460,000 additional investment; the investment elasticity at the intensive margin is estimated to be approximately 0.13.","The broad consensus among economists in favor of increased international integration through trade and investment openness has always been based on the assumption that the gains thereof are sufficiently large to compensate the losers of increasingly globalized economies. Especially the foreign activities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) have raised the concern that, at the end of the day, home countries lose, owing to a shift of production and employment abroad. A recent contribution to the literature on the consequences of MNE expansion abroad on home activity is that of Desai et al. (2009). Their study concludes that foreign operations of US firms between 1982 and 2004 have, on average, led to greater domestic investment and employee compensation. In contrast to this, other studies come to the opposite conclusion by providing evidence for a negative effect of foreign investment on home activities of MNEs.====Our paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between foreign and domestic investment of MNEs in three ways. First, we use a unique dataset that allows us to observe home and foreign investment activity of German MNEs, in addition to yearly balance-sheet information.==== Second, our econometric approach is based on propensity score methods and exploits variation at the extensive as well as intensive margin of foreign activity. Note that the ==== of foreign activity in our paper refers to the decision of setting up a new foreign entity. Hence, an extensive-margin estimate quantifies the treatment effect of foreign activity on investment activity at home. The ==== refers to the volume of foreign activity (measured in terms of fixed assets or in equity capital invested abroad). Hence, an intensive-margin estimate quantifies the effect of 1% more foreign activity on investment activity at home. One central advantage of our empirical approach is that it allows us to provide reliable estimates on intensive margin elasticities by explicitly modeling and conditioning on the extensive margin. The latter point, i.e., modeling the extensive margin, appears to be crucial as it determines observability and timing of foreign activity and the correlation thereof with endogenous firm characteristics. In numerous tests, we show that our estimation approach appropriately accounts for the simultaneous nature of foreign and domestic operations and other endogeneity issues. Third, and most importantly, we can identify the channels through which foreign activity affects domestic investment. In particular, we focus on three potential sources: technology, tax savings and profit shifting, and internal capital markets.====Our results presented in Section 5 of this paper indicate that establishing a new foreign affiliate is associated with more domestic investment activity. The effect is substantial, as our estimates imply a change in real investment activity at home of about EUR 460,000. As for the intensive margin, we estimate elasticities which lie in the range of 0.13 to 0.23, depending on the measure of foreign investment activity. The effect is smaller than the one found by Desai et al. (2009), who estimate that 1% greater foreign investment is associated with 0.26% greater domestic investment. Using our data, unconditional estimates suggest significantly higher elasticities in the range of 0.38 to 0.44.====Furthermore, we show that the basic effect of foreign activity on home investment is robust against a large number of sensitivity tests. These tests include (i) alternative measures of the outcome variable, (ii) tests for prior trends and lagged effects, (iii) alternative specifications of propensity score estimates, (iv) variations in treatment-control comparisons, and (v) the calculation of placebo effects.====Our findings indicate that the main channel through which the positive relationship can be explained is first and foremost related to issues of tax planning and profit shifting, as well as improved access to financing capital. The former allows firms to reduce their cost of capital by avoiding tax payments. The latter finding suggests that newly established foreign affiliates facilitate access to financial capital, which is then provided via an internal capital market to the home location. It is difficult, however, to clearly distinguish these two channels – profit shifting and internal financing, as they harness the same vehicle: internal debt. Quantifications show that the effect of establishing a new affiliate abroad becomes about twice as large if the tax differential between Germany and the foreign country is 10.5 percentage points higher than the average tax differential. A surprising new result is that foreign activity does not boost total factor productivity (TFP) or similar measures of productivity at home. Additional tests indicate that the effect is also not related to vertical foreign direct investment (FDI), which is usually associated with production substitution, outsourcing, and productivity gains from technology upgrading through vertical integration (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg, 2008; Navaretti et al., 2010). While we cannot clearly distinguish between horizontal and vertical FDI, many of our results seem to be consistent with the notion of horizontal FDI as a provider of intra-firm services (including financing and tax planning).====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section provides an overview of the related literature. Section 3 contains a concise introduction to the econometric methodology. Thereafter, we provide information on the panel dataset used for the empirical investigation and present descriptive statistics. The basic results from our empirical analysis are discussed in Section 5, including a comprehensive assessment of their robustness. In the subsequent section, we present three channels through which the observed effects might be explained. The last section serves as a conclusion: it summarizes the major findings and discusses some policy implications.","The effect of investing abroad on investment at home: On the role of technology, tax savings, and internal capital markets",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199618304069,January 2019,2019,Research Article,286.0

Using disaggregated trade data for more than 120 countries and different ==== measures of contractual dependence, we find robust support for the model's predictions. Our empirical approach exploits the variation in the occurrence of recessions and financial crises across countries and years, and the variation in contractual dependence across ====. We show that the amplification effects of contractual dependence on sectoral imports are statistically and economically significant.","Recent papers document the negative impact of macroeconomic crises on international trade. For example, Abiad et al. (2014) find empirically that financial crises are associated with significant declines in exports to the crisis country. In this paper, we argue that contractual imperfections are important to understand the adverse effect of crises on trade. Our main finding is that imports of crisis countries are disproportionately affected in industries that are more contractually vulnerable. In this way, we provide empirical evidence on a new mechanism that has been thus far ignored in the literature on crises and trade.====We use a simple model of trade with imperfect contracts to illustrate the theoretical mechanism and guide the empirical work. In the model, an adverse aggregate shock gives rise to a larger decline in imports in more contract-dependent industries—i.e., industries that are relatively worse affected by weak contract enforcement.==== This result is due to a complementarity between imperfect contract enforcement in the importing country and contract dependence at the industry level.====Our theory builds on the intuition that when exporters are paid by importers after delivery of the goods, the risk of default of importers matters (Schmidt-Eisenlohr, 2013). We first assume that the probability that importers honor their contracts is procyclical. A second key assumption is that imperfect contract enforcement affects different industries differently. In particular, the probability of contract enforcement decreases when transactions involve complex goods.==== This is because complex goods have many characteristics (size, design, material, etc.), which makes importers in these industries more likely to dispute the quality of the delivered products than importers of simple goods. Moreover, since complex goods are often customized to the needs of specific buyers, their market value inside the original exporter-importer relationship is higher than outside of it. This gives importers of complex goods an incentive to act opportunistically and renege on their contracts, in line with the intuition of the hold-up problem (see, e.g., Williamson, 1985). We provide empirical evidence to support those two assumptions.====Using disaggregated bilateral trade data, we quantify the impact of contractual dependence at the industry level in crisis times. The empirical approach exploits the variation in the occurrence of crises across 124 importing countries from 1989 to 2006, and the variation in contractual vulnerability across (up to) 351 SIC manufacturing industries.==== Following a “difference-in-difference” strategy in the tradition of Rajan and Zingales (1998), we test whether more contractually-vulnerable industries experienced larger import declines during crises, after controlling for a wide array of fixed effects (including at the importer-exporter-industry level, at the exporter-industry-year level, and at the importer-year level). We simultaneously use three measures of crises in the regressions: recessions alone, financial crises alone, and recessions with financial crises. The results confirm the negative average effects of crises on trade flows found in previous papers, but we also show that trade declines disproportionately in more contract-dependent industries. In most of our estimates, these sectoral effects are statistically significant and economically important. This finding is the central contribution of the paper.====We find that when crises involve recessions with financial disruptions, the amplification effects of contractual dependence at the industry level are particularly strong. According to one of our estimates, a recession with financial crisis is associated with a 7.5% larger drop in imports in an industry that is highly contract dependent (e.g., “Printed Circuit Boards”) relative to an industry that exhibits little dependence (e.g., “Steel Works, Blast Furnaces, and Rolling Mills”). To put this result in perspective, we find that the ==== impact of a recession with financial crisis on sectoral imports is close to −16%, while the analogous estimates in the case of a financial crisis alone and a recession alone are nearly −4% and −1%, respectively.====The main results are robust to the following exercises: (i) using different sets of fixed effects, (ii) controlling for an industry measure of financial vulnerability, (iii) controlling for industry measures of cyclicality (or durability), (iv) controlling for an industry measure of upstreamness, (v) controlling for an industry measure of inventory holdings, and (vi) controlling for an industry measure of price rigidity. The data also support our model-based implication that conditional on a crisis in the importing country, a longer distance between trading partners magnifies the sectoral trade effects of contractual dependence. Further, we report that in countries with higher institutional quality (proxied by the rule of law), the amplification effect of contractual vulnerability on sectoral imports tends to be smaller.====We use three industry measures of contractual vulnerability in the empirical analysis. Two of them are standard in the literature. The first one is the Nunn (2007) index of contract-intensity of goods, measured by the value share of inputs that Nunn identifies as relationship-specific. Levchenko (2007) provides us with a second indicator, which he constructs as an index of input-use concentration. Levchenko explicitly points out that his index represents a measure of product complexity; in our paper, as in Krishna and Levchenko (2012) and Hoefele et al. (2016), we make a similar assumption in terms of the Nunn index.====We also use a third and novel industry measure of contractual vulnerability, which we call the “uncollectible index”. By quantifying the share of account receivables uncollected compared to what was available to collect in a given period, the uncollectible index directly reflects payment defaults and delays in business-to-business transactions. We obtain the data to construct this indicator from the Credit Research Foundation's National Summary of Domestic Trade Receivables, a proprietary quarterly survey of large U.S. firms. Our results are robust to the use of the Nunn, the Levchenko, and the uncollectible indices.====The well-established contract theory literature (see, e.g., Williamson, 1979, Williamson, 1985; Grossman and Hart, 1986; and Hart and Moore, 1999) underscores the importance of contracting institutions. By regulating transactions between private parties, contracting institutions prevent opportunistic behavior, namely deviations of the parties from the prespecified contractual terms due to imperfections in implementation and enforcement. As summarized in Antràs (2015), several difficulties make the contractual imperfections associated with international transactions particularly acute. First, it can be difficult to determine which country's laws apply to a particular contract, especially since many contracts do not include a ==== clause. Second, there is potential bias of courts in favor of their national citizens. Third, it is practically impossible in many cases to enforce decisions stipulated in a court's verdict. Recent coordinated attempts to reduce the contractual risk involving international transactions—notably, the Contracts for the International Sale of Goods initiative, and resorting to international arbitrators such as the International Chamber of Commerce—have fallen short of their objectives and represent partial solutions at best. Quoting Rodrik (2000), Antràs (2015) concludes that ultimately international contracts remain incomplete.====This paper is related to the literature on the impact of financial crises and recessions on trade (Levchenko et al., 2010; Berman and Martin, 2012; Berman et al., 2012; Bricongne et al., 2012; Chor and Manova, 2012; Bems et al., 2013; Abiad et al., 2014; Eaton et al., 2016). A large part of this literature analyzes the so-called Great Trade Collapse of 2008–09. These papers have documented the role of several mechanisms, such as compositional effects, supply chains, credit constraints, protectionism, and exchange rate dynamics. Our work contributes to this line of research by emphasizing a new mechanism—i.e., contractual imperfections—that helps explain the negative effects of crises on trade and their heterogeneous impact across industries.====The paper is also connected to the literature on contracting institutions and trade (see Nunn and Trefler, 2014, and Antràs, 2015 for comprehensive reviews). A large bulk of this research has found that contracting institutions are an important determinant of comparative advantage, documenting that countries with better contracting environments export more contract-intensive goods, on average. Levchenko (2007) and Nunn (2007) are seminal contributions to that literature. Our use of the contractual-vulnerability indices introduced in those papers to analyze the effects of crises on trade is new relative to previous work. Furthermore, while those papers look at implications from static frameworks, we concentrate on the impact of imperfect contract enforcement on the dynamics of trade.====Our theoretical mechanism relies on the role of default risk in trade. Other recent papers also study the implications of importers' repayment probability, but they mainly focus on how this risk affects the choice of financing terms that support international trade (Schmidt-Eisenlohr, 2013; Ahn, 2014; Antràs and Foley, 2015; Hoefele et al., 2016).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical framework and its main testable implications. Section 3 presents the empirical methodology, describes the data, and shows evidence on the relationship between crises and contract enforcement. Section 4 discusses the main results and robustness exercises.

The prediction is identical in response to purely common shocks in the same model augmented with simple country heterogeneity (e.g., where depreciation rates or factor shares are different across countries). This happens because common shocks have heterogeneous consequences on the marginal products of capital across countries, which triggers international investment. In the data, filtering out common shocks requires therefore allowing for country-specific loadings. We show that ","Understanding how disturbances propagate across countries is of first-order importance. Openness in general is often singled out as a plausible and significant propagation channel. Historically openness to goods trade came first, and there is robust evidence that trade partners display correlated business cycles.==== The global consequences of the 2007–2008 recession have contributed to shifting the focus on the importance of financial linkages. While it was always important to assess how financial integration affects the international synchronization of business cycles, the question has become of paramount importance since 2008, for policy-makers and researchers alike.====In the canonical two-country real business cycles model with country-specific productivity shocks (Backus et al., 1992, BKK henceforth) capital flows to wherever returns are higher. Therefore, greater financial linkages lower the international synchronization of business cycles in response to country-specific shocks. But in a similar two-country model, augmented with credit or collateral constraints, a country-specific shock that makes the constraint binding at home is contagious abroad as domestic agents recall foreign assets to meet the constraint.==== There is no reason for the constraint to become binding in response to a specific kind of shock: demand, supply, or even financial shocks may all create a binding constraint, and so trigger contagion. Here, therefore, greater financial linkages can increase synchronization in response to country-specific shocks. The common feature of these models is that they analyze the consequences of purely idiosyncratic, country-specific shocks, with ambiguous predictions.====It is not difficult to see that similar predictions arise from the canonical international RBC model in response to common shocks, provided that some mild heterogeneity exists across countries. For instance, countries with different depreciation rates or different capital shares react to the same technology shock with different magnitudes, driving a gap between the marginal products of capital on impact. As a result, international investment rises, and the international synchronization of cycles falls. In fact, the predictions of BKK with homogeneous countries and idiosyncratic shocks are observationally equivalent to its predictions with heterogeneous countries and common shocks, for plausible parametrization of heterogeneity.====Fig. 1 plots the responses of output to a technology shock as implied by two versions of BKK. Panel (A) reproduces the well known results in BKK in response to a shock to productivity in the Home country, under the conventional symmetric calibration. Panel (B) introduces a version of BKK that deviates from the original in two dimensions: (i) the productivity shock is common, i.e. perfectly synchronized across countries; and (ii) the share of capital is heterogeneous across countries, taking values of 0.44 in the Home country, and 0.32 in the Foreign country.==== Both panels imply responses of output that are negatively correlated across countries on impact.====To investigate the ambiguous link between finance and synchronization in response to country-specific shocks, it is therefore important to control for common shocks that are allowed to have different effects across countries. The conventional approach consists in including time effects or trends in an estimation whose dependent variable measures the synchronization of cycles between countries ==== and ====. This does eliminate the effects of those shocks that by construction have identical effects on both economies. But it does not eliminate common shocks with heterogeneous effects that are likely to exist in a world where countries display fundamental differences. To eliminate common shocks with heterogeneous effects, alternatives are necessary. This paper follows the simplest possible approach: the shocks are identified by the principal components that are common to at least two countries, where the loadings on each principal component are allowed to be country-specific. In the main text, the loadings are assumed constant, but for robustness we also repeat the analysis estimating a factor model that allows for time-varying loadings using Bayesian techniques.==== Both decompositions have the advantage of simplicity and an established place in the literature.==== There are of course many alternatives, which we leave for further work. However, we also provide analytically a general intuition for the results of the paper, which is not conditioned on one specific way to isolate common shocks with heterogeneous effects.====Conditional on common shocks (with heterogeneous effects), we confirm that finance and synchronization correlate negatively. The result supports Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2013a, Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2013b (KPP henceforth), who show that an increase in financial integration causes a fall in business cycle synchronization in 18 OECD countries. But our interpretation differs from theirs. According to KPP, the data support the view that financial flows are efficient in their quest for high returns, behaving exactly as the canonical international RBC model predicts in response to idiosyncratic shocks. We conclude instead that the finding arises at least in part in response to common shocks with heterogeneous effects.====Now these effects are given parametrically: they represent the response of country ==== to a common shock, which differs from the response of country ==== because, say, the countries have different capital shares. The difference in responses is therefore a constant, given by the differences in deep parameters of the model. Empirically, the response of a given country's GDP to the common shock is given by the factor loading in the principal component estimation; we call it the country's “elasticity of GDP” to the common shock. We show that capital tends to flow from countries with inelastic GDP to countries with elastic GDP in response to a positive common shock, and vice versa for negative shocks. An interpretation is that on average countries with elastic GDP should be net recipients of international capital in years of global boom, but net contributors in years of global recession. We document this correlation in OECD data.====In contrast, there is no systematic time pattern in the response of international investment to purely country-specific shocks: source and destination countries change depending on the realization of the shocks, as in BKK. Interestingly, increases in financial linkages are almost always associated with ==== synchronized business cycles in response to well identified country-specific shocks. The coefficient estimates are never negative, and significantly positive in virtually all the specifications we consider.==== This stands in contrast with common shocks, and suggests financial links can in fact foster the contagious propagation of ==== shocks across borders. In theory, this result supports the existence of (endogenously binding) constraints: in response to country-specific shocks, financial flows may serve to alleviate collateral or balance sheet constraints, rather than to take advantage of attractive differentials between returns across countries.====Can we easily interpret common and idiosyncratic shocks in terms of changes in technology, in demand, or in financial health? This is an important question in light of the Great Recession of 2008, often understood as a financial shock that was fundamentally different from the preceding history. For instance, Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2003) construct a simple model that implies financial contagion via financial shocks, and show empirically that finance and synchronization moved in the same direction during the Great Recession. They interpret the shock in 2008 as fundamentally different from the preceding history during which finance and synchronization went in opposite directions. We emphasize that our decomposition is just a generalization of the conventional empirical approach that control for common shocks using year effects: our common shocks are more general, and of course they nest the special case of common shocks with similar effects across countries. What we identify as “idiosyncratic shocks” is merely a subset of the shocks considered, among others, in Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2013a, Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2013b, one that controls for common shocks with heterogeneous effects. There is neither more nor less reason to call these shocks “demand”, “supply” or “financial” in this paper than there is elsewhere in this literature. We argue it is only idiosyncratic shocks that have ambiguous consequences on the link between finance and synchronization, not common ones. The claim is true irrespective whether these shocks are to the supply, the demand, or the financial side of the economy.====Unsurprisingly, the recent years have witnessed a plethora of models where financial integration results in contagion. Early contributions include Devereux and Yetman (2010) where contagion is triggered by leverage-constrained investors. As portfolios are modified in response to a shock, the leverage constraint becomes binding elsewhere, with contagious consequences. Devereux and Yu (2014) extend the model to investigate the welfare consequences of financial integration. Dedola and Lombardo (2012) emphasize the importance of globally correlated borrowing costs in creating contagion. The common feature of these theories is the presence of financial frictions, which result in country-specific shocks that are contagious through endogenously binding constraints.====The empirical literature is equally replete with analyses of whether financial linkages are contagious or not. In an early contribution, Morgan et al. (2004) investigate how bank ownership across US states affect fluctuations in Gross State Products. They find the lifting of branching regulations between 1976 and 1994 resulted in synchronized states' business cycles. Imbs (2006) finds a similar result in a cross-section of countries, using alternative measures of international financial integration. Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2013a, Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2013b argue the finding is driven by permanent features of country pairs, which result in both synchronized cycles and financial linkages. In 18 OECD countries, they show the link between finance and synchronization becomes negative once country-pair specific intercepts are accounted for. The results are confirmed by Duval et al. (2016) in 63 advanced and emerging countries between 1995 and 2013. Monnet and Puy (2016) show that the share of the variance of GDP explained by global shocks is lowest during periods of financial integration, which suggests idiosyncratic shocks are more prevalent in those periods.====It is well known that the bulk of the volatility in GDP across countries can be explained by common shocks. In a series of influential papers, Kose et al., 2003, Kose et al., 2008, Crucini et al. (2011), or Hirata et al. (2013) identify the contribution of common shocks (global or regional) to individual countries' business cycles. A key result is that shocks common to two or more countries constitute the main driver of business cycles in both the developed and developing worlds. The details of the decompositions depend on the sample of countries and time coverage; but common shocks rarely explain less than half of GDP growth volatility, and often more than 75 percent.====The possibility that common shocks have heterogeneous loadings is an old tradition in empirical macroeconomics. Forni and Reichlin (1998) identify sector-level effects of aggregate shocks in the US. Bernanke et al. (2005) augment standard Vector Auto-Regressions with unobserved factors to identify their potentially heterogeneous consequences on economic activity. Mumtaz et al. (2011) extend the approach to an international context. Peersman and Smets (2005) identify heterogeneous effects of monetary shocks at sector level. Kilian (2008) shows the consequences of exogenous oil shocks are heterogeneous across G7 countries. Giannone and Lenza (2010) show that the high correlation between domestic savings and investment, also known as the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle, can be rationalized with global shocks that are allowed to have heterogeneous effects on saving and investment at country level.====The rest of the paper is structured as followed. Section 2 presents the conventional estimation of the effects of finance on synchronization. Common shocks are discussed in terms of their theoretical impact on the correlation between finance and synchronization. Section 3 introduces the data, and discusses the relevance of common vs. idiosyncratic shocks in GDP and in financial data. The decomposition is then used to discuss the effects of finance on synchronization. Section 4 discusses some extensions.

We show that as long as the economy remains financially open, domestic asset supply policies or reducing the effective lower bound on policy rates may be ineffective or even counterproductive. However, closing domestic capital markets does not necessarily enhance the monetary authorities' ability to rescue the economy from stagnation.","Real interest rates in the industrialized world fell to historic lows in the two decades prior to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, and fell even further thereafter. Unemployment rose during the crisis, and remains high in several major economies. Leading observers have raised concerns that this may reflect “secular stagnation” (Summers (2013), echoing Hansen (1938))—a durable, possibly permanent fall in the natural interest rate to levels too low to be attained with existing (low) inflation targets, hence giving rise to chronic unemployment (Eggertsson et al. (2018)). Under a leading interpretation, secular stagnation is the result of an “asset shortage”: because of financial distortions in the form of credit constraints on economic agents with high marginal propensity to spend, the desired savings of the economy at full employment cannot be absorbed by the stores of value available in the domestic economy at positive interest rates.====In this paper, we study the implications of global secular stagnation for macroeconomic dynamics and the trade-offs faced by policymakers in a small open economy that is integrated in world goods and financial markets. Open economies can in principle alleviate asset shortages by acquiring foreign assets and depreciating their currencies. Eggertsson et al. (2016) (henceforth EMSS) and Caballero et al. (2016) (henceforth CFG) study a global equilibrium in which the negative spillovers from such developments can actually spread secular stagnation worldwide. Complementing these analyses, we study the domestic equilibrium and issues in economic stabilization of a country that simultaneously faces weak external demand due to the global slump and, as long as it remains financially open, an inefficiently high real interest rate, pinned down by the equilibrium conditions in international capital markets. To carry out our analysis, we build an overlapping-generations framework that accounts for the key features stressed by EMSS and CFG. In particular, we specify an economy that has some monopoly power over its terms of trade, but is otherwise small enough not to affect the policy behavior and the macroeconomic equilibrium in the rest of the world.====Our main contributions are as follows. First, we show that under plausible conditions a small open economy in a world of chronic deflation and deficient demand can be in either of two disjoint steady-state equilibria—an underemployment steady state symmetric to the rest of the world, and a full-employment equilibrium with inflation at target, trend nominal depreciation, a permanently weaker real exchange rate and the accumulation of net foreign assets. In the full-employment equilibrium, trend nominal depreciation is required to insulate domestic inflation from the deflationary drift abroad (associated to the global secular stagnation). A depreciated real exchange rate is required to maintain a high foreign demand for domestic output and support full employment. Accumulation of net foreign assets is required to absorb higher national savings, to the extent that these are generated by income and balance sheet effects from escaping secular stagnation.====Second, we study welfare gains from escaping global secular stagnation, which are the result of two opposing forces. On the one hand, when pursuing domestic full employment, domestic incomes and lifetime utilities rise with increasing output at given terms of trade. On the other hand, for a given output path, real depreciation reduces purchasing power internationally and may exacerbate the financial constraints in the economy—in our baseline, these constraints limit the ability of the young generation to borrow and consume in anticipation of future income, the value of which falls with real depreciation.==== We find that the adverse income effects of real depreciation may be strong enough to reduce welfare overall. This is the case if trade elasticities are sufficiently low, as this increases the rate of real depreciation required to support full employment. Moreover, as further discussed below, beggar-thy-self effects also arise independently of trade elasticities when countries attempt to escape stagnation by relying on policies that address domestic distortions. Currency wars can therefore be ==== rather than ====.====Third, we characterize the macroeconomic dynamics along the transition from the underemployment to the full-employment equilibrium. Since bringing the economy to full employment entails an increase in domestic inflation relative to the rest of the world, it follows that the nominal exchange rate must steadily depreciate—an echo of Svensson's “Foolproof Method” (Svensson (2001))—and therefore that escape is not possible without exchange rate flexibility. However, capital mobility means that the real interest rate is pinned down in international bond markets, and hence is the same (and too high) in both the stagnation ==== the full-employment equilibrium. This is in contrast to theoretical and policy accounts of business-cycle stabilization, stressing the need for policy makers to set the real interest rate at its “natural” level to achieve full employment.====Three additional sets of results concern policy making, regarding capital controls, measures that address domestic financial distortions by raising asset supply, and monetary stabilization. First, as concerns capital controls, it is well understood that by preventing cross-border asset trade, domestic policy makers can regain control over domestic real interest rates, as these are no longer determined in international financial markets via international asset arbitrage. In a global stagnation, however, control over the real rate may not be helpful per se, because the natural rate under financial autarky may still be negative and unachievable by conventional monetary policy due to the zero lower bound on nominal rates. The question is whether, under such circumstances, the country is nonetheless able to achieve full employment by boosting its competitiveness and external demand via depreciation. We show that the answer is negative. As long as the financial autarky natural rate is not high enough upon closing the economy financially, barring the possibility to accumulate foreign assets actually eliminates the full-employment steady state: there is no equilibrium in which the increase in external demand following real depreciation is sufficient to rebalance the secular stagnation distortions. This result provides an instructive caveat on the desirability of capital controls as a way to avoid secular underemployment. In a global secular stagnation, capital controls are effective only if complemented by policies that raise domestic asset supply, with sufficiently positive effects on the domestic natural rate.====Although measures that increase the supply of domestic assets are desirable under financial autarky, we show that domestic policymakers have no incentive to pursue them under financial integration, for two reasons. First, these measures are neutral in terms of domestic output and inflation—again, this follows from the fact that real rates are not sensitive to domestic savings imbalances, but determined internationally. Second, more importantly, to the extent that they raise the saving-absorption capacity of the economy, such measures lead to capital inflows, and thus to lower external surpluses and a weaker real exchange rate. By the logic of the “transfer problem” in international economics (after Keynes (1929)), aggregate consumption falls, which is detrimental to national welfare. Hence under financial integration, measures to address domestic financial distortions aimed at raising the domestic natural rate, turn out to be ====.====Similar considerations apply to policies attempting to counter low inflation and/or lackluster growth by relaxing the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates.==== We show that, in financially integrated small open economies, a lower ELB is generally not beneficial to welfare. The intuition resonates with the neoFisherian argument recently made by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2017) and Cochrane (2017), among others. Namely, with real rates determined internationally, lower nominal rates must eventually entail trend exchange rate appreciation, lower inflation, and thereby a more negative output gap. Hence, again, a measure aimed to address domestic distortions turns out to be ==== under financial integration. Yet, we also emphasize that, should the ELB become binding ====, relaxing it can help to ease the transition to full employment.====Two points of contact with the literature are worth highlighting here. In line with the recent literature reviving secular stagnation, we focus on the case where the world is ==== in a liquidity trap with negative natural rates. Yet, our analysis naturally relates to contributions that study open economies in a ==== liquidity trap, either using a two-country model (Cook and Devereux (2013) and Acharya and Bengui (2017)), or taking the perspective of a small open economy (Corsetti et al. (2017)). Exchange rate adjustment is key in all these studies as well as the present one to moderate the negative effects of a global liquidity trap for the domestic economy. In particular, the nominal exchange rate needs to depreciate persistently for domestic inflation to rise above the world deflationary drift. But in contrast to our analysis, in these frameworks the domestic real rate must fall to boost demand.====As we focus on a small open economy, we do not discuss the cross-border spillovers that may stem from different domestic adjustment paths—amply discussed by Eggertsson et al. (2016) and Caballero et al. (2016) in their two-country frameworks. By no means do we intend to downplay these issues. In particular, if a sufficient number of small open economies pursue the escape path depreciating their currencies, their joint behavior is likely to have a first-order effect on the world real interest rate and allocation. In this case, domestic policymakers might need to focus on domestic stimulus rather than relying solely on the exchange rate channel, while support from other policies, including structural policies and asset-supply policies, might be necessary to lift global natural rates.==== It is precisely because, as we have shown here, each small country has an incentive to pursue an individual escape path from stagnation—but not to raise the supply of its assets by addressing domestic financial distortions—that international policy coordination may be highly beneficial.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the two-country model used in our analysis. Section 3 establishes that a full-employment steady state exists under financial integration, but also that this steady state may be welfare inferior (==== to the stagnation steady state. It also studies how the economy escapes from the secular stagnation. 4 Capital flows and asset supply, 5 Reforming the monetary policy framework turn to policies and discuss, respectively, financial autarky and asset supply policies, and alternative monetary policies.
