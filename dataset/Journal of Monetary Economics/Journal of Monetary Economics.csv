At the country level, we document that countries with a larger number of non-zero intersectoral linkages (denser networks) display a more negatively skewed cyclical component of output. At the firm level, we find that firms with a larger number of suppliers and customers (degrees) display a more negatively-skewed distribution of their output growth. To rationalize these findings, we construct a multisector model with input-output linkages and show that the relationship between output skewness and network density naturally arises once we consider non-linearities in production. In an economy with low production flexibility (inputs are gross complements), denser production structures imply that relying on more inputs becomes a risk that further amplifies the effects of negative productivity shocks. The opposite holds if firms display high production flexibility (inputs are gross substitutes): having more inputs to choose from becomes an opportunity to diversify the effects of negative productivity shocks. We calibrate the model using our rich firm-to-firm network Chilean data and show that more connected firms experience larger declines in output in response to a COVID-19 shock, consistent with the data. We also show that, as in the data, the cross-sectional distribution of output growth in the model displays a fatter left tail during downturns. The previous result is shaped by the interplay between production complementarities and network interconnectedness, rather than by the asymmetry of the shocks. The size of the shock determines the strength of the relationship between degrees and output decline, which highlights the importance of non-linearities and the limitations of local approximations.",None,Business cycle asymmetry and input-output structure: The role of firm-to-firm networks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439322300065X,Available online 13 May 2023,2023,Research Article,2.0

Banks and corporates with a higher share of funding from non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) or in US dollars experienced significantly greater stress, while more funding in debt instruments (versus loans) or cross-border (versus domestically) did not affect resilience. Policies targeting these structural vulnerabilities (US$ swap lines and NBFI policies) were more effective at mitigating stress than policies supporting banks, even controlling for macroeconomic policies.

We focus on banks and corporates and evaluate the importance of: the source of funding (from households, banks or non-bank financial institutions), the instrument of funding (loans versus debt markets), the currency of funding (US dollar versus other currencies) and the geographical location of the counterparty (domestic or cross-border). Our results suggest that some funding structures were associated with a significant increase in sensitivity to the extreme risk-off shock in early 2020: namely dependence on non-bank financial institutions (henceforth: NBFIs) and US dollars (henceforth: US$). More specifically, banks which were more reliant on funding from NBFIs experienced significantly more stress, and those more reliant on funding from household deposits experienced significantly less stress. Banks, and in some specifications corporates, were also significantly more vulnerable if they relied more on US$ funding. In contrast, whether funding in either sector was obtained via loans (instead of debt markets), or cross-border (instead of domestically), was not significantly related to resilience during March 2020. After financial stress spiked, policy responses targeting these specific vulnerabilities (i.e., NBFI-focused policies and US$ swap lines) were successful at significantly mitigating the increase in ====This paper makes several contributions to the rapidly growing literature evaluating financial vulnerabilities during Covid (e.g., ====; ====; ====) and evaluating the success of macroprudential reforms to date (====; ====). First, it uses data on corporates, banks and sovereigns to better capture the relationships between financial stress and funding structures not just across countries—but also across these different sectors within a country.==== This is a broader focus than most other work, which tends to focus on just one sector, and is important as macroprudential reforms may have bolstered certain segments of the economy (such as banks), but simultaneously increased the vulnerability of other sectors. Second, the paper focuses on high frequency data on CDS spreads by sector. This involved a substantial data compilation effort, but is useful to capture short-lived periods of financial stress, including stress for different reasons (from liquidity issues to solvency concerns) as well as across countries and sectors.====This paper begins with a brief review of the large and long-standing literature on the vulnerabilities from different forms of financial intermediation that are the focus of the empirical analysis. This includes vulnerabilities associated with: banking intermediation, non-bank financial intermediation, foreign exchange exposure, and cross-border borrowing. The review also highlights recent papers on the period of the heightened market volatility and financial stress during the early stages of the pandemic.====Then, the paper introduces the key measure of financial stress used throughout the analysis: a measure calculated at a daily frequency and by sector and country. This measure is constructed from a newly created database with information on 2,532 CDS series, covering 68 countries with information for three sectors: sovereigns, banks and corporates. This high-frequency, cross-sector-country measure allows us to use two different empirical frameworks for the main analysis: a ==== panel that controls for country and sector fixed effects, and a ==== panel that also incorporates the time-series dimension. We use this data to calculate measures of financial stress during the ====, which we define in our baseline as the log change in CDS from January 1 of 2020 until March 23 (when most measures of stress peaked and before the numerous policy measures were announced).==== An initial comparison of these CDS series shows that the CDS for banks increased less than for corporates and sovereigns during the ====, consistent with arguments that macroprudential reforms over the last decade meaningfully improved the resilience of banking systems. There is also substantial variation in these changes in CDS spreads across countries and sectors, however, particularly across banking sectors.====Are these differences in resilience related to different funding structures? In order to explore any relationships, the paper then builds on prior literature and empirical evidence to develop a framework that decomposes funding into key components that could affect the extent of financial stress experienced in different sectors and countries during the Covid Shock. It focuses on two forms of financial ====: the source of funding (household deposits, other banks, or NBFIs) and the instrument of funding (loans or “other” instruments, which are primarily debt markets).==== It also focuses on two forms of financial internationalization: the currency (either US$ or local currency) and the counterparty location (either cross-border or domestic). This discussion includes information on the diverse datasets on these funding structures, relying heavily on several sources from the BIS. An initial look at how this data on funding structures correlates to measures of sector-country stress generally supports previous literature.====Next, this paper shifts to the main focus—regression analysis of the relationship between financial stress during the ==== and pre-pandemic funding structures.==== We use two empirical methodologies: one which focuses on the relative resilience of different sectors within countries over the full period of the ==== (the ==== approach), and one which focuses on daily changes in financial stress within each country-sector pair (the ==== approach). We examine the role of different forms of financial ==== and ====, both individually and simultaneously. Several patterns occur consistently across specifications. Banks with a higher share of funding from NBFIs were less resilient during the ====, and those that were more reliant on funding from household deposits were significantly more resilient. Banks—and in some specifications corporates—with a higher share of funding in US$ were also significantly less resilient. In contrast, there is only weak evidence on whether funding through loans (instead of debt markets) was correlated with greater resilience, and no consistent evidence on whether obtaining funding domestically (instead of cross-border) was related to resilience. These findings are fairly consistent across specifications, including for a series of sensitivity tests that contain different control variables (including for asset exposures), exclude emerging markets, and adjust the timing of the window defined as the ====.====By the end of April 2020, however, the financial stress experienced in some sectors and related to certain funding structures fell significantly. Why were banks with greater exposure to NBFI funding and US$ funding no longer experiencing significantly greater stress—with no comparable improvement for corporates with similar vulnerabilities? How important were policies targeting vulnerabilities around NBFI and dollar funding relative to broader policies aimed at banks or easing overall financial conditions? To answer these questions, the paper then tests how different policy responses in March and April of 2020 affected the stress related to certain funding structures. In other words, after the risk-off shock occurred, which policies were most effective at reducing the stresses highlighted earlier in the paper? The ability to identify the impact of different policies during this period is challenging, however, as most countries enacted multiple policies around the same time to address a range of concerns around market liquidity and other aspects of market functioning, as well as to support growth, incomes and employment and slow the spread of the virus. The ==== framework used in this paper can help solve this identification challenge by isolating the differential impact on specific structures across sectors within each country. The daily data used in the ==== framework also allows us to identify the immediate impact of key policy announcements. Put slightly differently, our approach allows us to better test exactly which policies reduced stress related to specific structures that are linked to fragility and which policies “broke the link” between higher global volatility and country-sector stress.====Critical to this approach is the ability to integrate our analysis with a new and extremely rich high-frequency dataset on policy responses during Covid from ==== to support the broader economy, but could also have affected the relationship between funding structures and CDS spreads.====The results show that some structure-specific policies were effective at alleviating specific forms of financial stress. More specifically, policies aimed at supporting NBFIs significantly reduced the stress experienced by banks that were more reliant on NBFI funding. New US$ swap lines also significantly reduced the stress related to FX funding by banks—providing evidence on the channels through which US$ swap lines reduced strains in funding markets (see ====). These structure-specific policies appeared to be more effective at reducing the forms of stress identified in banks than policies easing broader bank regulations and buffers. These very targeted policies also significantly improved resilience when controlling for policies aimed at supporting the broader economy, suggesting that economy-wide policies (such as adjusting interest rates, purchasing assets and adopting broader liquidity programs) were not able to get “====” of the financial system (====).====Two caveats are important for interpreting this paper's results. This analysis only focuses on one episode—the period of acute financial stress during the first months of the Covid pandemic. Relationships may be different during this period than other periods of financial stress, especially as the shock was not generated by the typical financial boom-bust cycle, but instead generated by a pandemic and the corresponding government restrictions. This focus on one period severely limits the degrees of freedom, and thereby constrains our ability to include as extensive a set of controls as we would like in some specifications. Also, the analysis identifies correlations between different funding structures and the extent of financial stress, but not the underlying factors which could drive the evolution of these structures, and which could in turn reflect underlying resilience (i.e., endogeneity). For example, countries with certain vulnerabilities may have been more likely to adopt certain funding structures (e.g., relying more on NBFIs or US$ funding). Although we control for country and sector effects, our results cannot fully identify whether it is the underlying vulnerability in the sector or the related funding structure that increased fragility during the ====.====Overall, however, the results should contribute to the rapidly growing body of literature that helps understand the financial fragility in the spring of 2020 and sets priorities for the next phase of financial regulation. The results highlight the importance of focusing on vulnerabilities related to NBFIs and dollar exposures—especially in banks. The fragilities exposed in the spring of 2020 suggest that although the post-2008 regulatory reforms improved the resilience of banks, there is still more work to be done. Our findings also highlight priorities for regulations related to international exposures. The evidence that the currency of the funding—rather than whether the funding is cross-border—is more important during a period of stress suggests that macroprudential FX regulations (which focus on the currency of the transaction) would be more effective at reducing vulnerabilities in the future than ==== (which focus on the residency of the parties to the transaction).====The results also provide guidance, and raise important questions, on how to best address certain periods of financial stress in the future. In situations where key vulnerabilities contributing to financial stress can be identified (e.g., from NBFIs or US$ exposure), policies targeting these specific vulnerabilities should be considered as part of the policy response.==== During the ====, these policies appeared to complement the simultaneous support from changes in broader prudential regulations and economy-wide measures. In the future, are there conditions under which more targeted policy responses could not only complement, but substitute for, broader regulatory easing and monetary stimulus? If these targeted policies addressed specific areas of financial stress, could this reduce potential conflicts with efforts to achieve other macroeconomic or wider financial stability objectives? Would relying more on targeted responses in the future generate moral hazard in the specific sectors that receive support, possibly increasing vulnerabilities? These questions will become increasingly important if fragilities that emerge in specific segments of financial markets can evolve into systemic financial risks and if financial intermediation continues to shift outside the banking system.====The remainder of the paper is as follows. ==== reviews the literature on the financial vulnerabilities that are the focus of the analysis, as well as recent work describing the period of financial stress in the early stages of the pandemic. ==== discusses our new dataset of credit default swaps capturing stress in different sectors, including key patterns in early 2020. ==== develops the framework to analyze the relationship between different funding structures and financial stress, including key data and some initial correlations. ==== presents the core of our empirical analysis, including the two estimation methodologies and the series of results relating financial stress to funding structures. ==== estimates the impact of different policy responses (targeting specific structural vulnerabilities, banks, or the broader economy) in alleviating financial stress.

We study this demand reallocation in a multi-sector model featuring sticky prices, input-output linkages, and labor reallocation costs. Reallocation costs hamper the increase in the supply of goods, causing inflationary pressures. These pressures are amplified by the fact that goods prices are more flexible than services prices. We estimate the model allowing for demand reallocation, sectoral productivity, and aggregate labor supply shocks. The demand reallocation shock explains a large portion of the rise in U.S. inflation in the aftermath of the pandemic."," In particular, we assume that firms face convex hiring costs when increasing their labor input; as our model does not include capital, these hiring costs capture a variety of frictions affecting a firm’s ability to expand its productive capacity. Based on the aggregate and cross-sectional developments outlined in ==== and ====, we allow for three shocks: a preference shock that alters the relative demand for goods and services; sectoral productivity shocks; and an aggregate labor supply shock. Using aggregate and cross-sectional data, we then estimate the parameters governing hiring costs and production function elasticities as well as the size of the aggregate labor supply shock. The estimated model allows us to quantify the role that each shock has played in driving aggregate and cross-sectional developments in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.====We study the implications of each of the three shocks individually and then examine how well the model fits the data when all the shocks occur at once. We find that the demand reallocation shock is able to explain a large portion—3.5 percentage points—of the increase in U.S. inflation post-pandemic.====At the industry level, we show that our demand reallocation shock is able to explain a good proportion of the cross-sectional evolution of prices and quantities since the onset of the pandemic. Not only does the shock explain why goods prices have risen more than services prices, but it also accounts for the observed heterogeneity within goods-producing and within services-producing industries, despite the fact that it affects final demand for goods and services uniformly. Both input-output linkages and sectoral heterogeneity in ====We then examine the two supply shocks. The sectoral productivity shocks are motivated by the increase in the dispersion of sector-level variables shown in ====. Additionally, some sectors, such as the metals or oil industries, have experienced both significant declines in production and increases in prices, which cannot be explained by demand reallocation alone. To account for this, we measure the evolution of total factor productivity at the industry level between 2019:Q4 and 2021:Q4, and feed the estimated shocks into our multi-sector model. We find that sectoral productivity shocks dramatically improve the model’s cross-sectional fit, but dampen aggregate inflation, as aggregate productivity rose above trend over this period. The final shock we consider is a reduction in aggregate labor supply, motivated by the prolonged decline in employment shown in ====. We estimate the magnitude of this shock and find that it explains approximately two-thirds of the post-pandemic decline in employment. However, its effect on inflation is relatively limited: on its own, it would only increase inflation by around 1.5 percentage points, which is less than half the impact of the demand reallocation shock.====When we consider the effect of all three shocks simultaneously, the estimated model can explain the majority of the rise in U.S. inflation between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021, largely driven by the demand reallocation shock.==== The model also explains a large proportion of the cross-sectional dynamics of prices and quantities: both the demand reallocation shock and the sectoral productivity shocks are important for this finding. The labor supply shock is important for explaining the persistent decline in aggregate employment, but plays a smaller role in explaining aggregate inflation and no role in accounting for the model’s cross-sectional fit.====We extend our model by conducting a variety of experiments pertaining to the properties of the demand reallocation shock. We find that an unexpected reversal of the reallocation shock would be inflationary, driven by rising services prices, as services sectors struggle to increase capacity. We also consider a scenario in which households and firms are repeatedly surprised about how persistent the reallocation shock is. In such a scenario, inflationary pressures are more muted, as services-producing sectors reduce output by less, and prices by more, than in our baseline assumption in which the high persistence of the shock is known immediately. We then apply our model to two episodes not directly targeted by our estimation exercise. We show that demand reallocation during the Great Recession—away from goods and towards services—may have raised inflation by around 1.5 percentage points. Finally, we show that the model can rationalize the persistence of inflation during 2022 when we allow for productivity developments that occurred in the first half of 2022, which were negative in many sectors, particularly those producing goods.====In ==== we describe the model, which we calibrate and estimate in ====. ==== studies the cross-sectional and aggregate effects of the demand reallocation shock and the two supply shocks: sectoral productivity shocks and an aggregate labor supply shock.

I examine the potential anti-lobbying effects of three salient types of international rules: exact policy commitments, policy bounds and non-discrimination rules. Unlike exact policy commitments, which remove policy discretion and hence shut down ex-post lobbying, policy bounds may invite ex-post lobbying and hence may forego part or all of the potential anti-lobbying gains. I also find that policy bounds may lead to mixed-strategy equilibria of the rent-seeking game.

Additionally, imperfect communication has a significant impact on the propagation of forward guidance. Finally, we develop a novel decomposition of the response of the economy to forward guidance.

The “purchasing power parity puzzle” concerns the empirical fact that real exchange rates appear to converge more slowly than nominal prices. In some New Keynesian models, when there is no interest-rate smoothing, the stickiness of prices does not matter at all for persistence, as Benigno (2004) showed. We show that in the presence of interest-rate smoothing, price stickiness does matter and endogenous real-exchange rate persistence is bounded above by the interest rate smoothing parameter and by the probability of a firm not changing prices under Calvo pricing. We also explain the relationship between the New Keynesian framework with Calvo pricing, and the Dornbusch framework where price stickiness is integral to real exchange rate convergence.",None,Real exchange rate convergence: The roles of price stickiness and monetary policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393218304781,May 2019,2019,Research Article,264.0
