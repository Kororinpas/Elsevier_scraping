To do that, we employ a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) with different scenarios focusing on increases in tariffs. The results show that the tariff increases negatively affect the US and China in terms of trade volume and economic growth, while it leads to trade diversion and creation for the SSA. This offers valuable opportunities in improving exports and economic growth, particularly for Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria. On the sectorial level, the findings imply that agriculture, food, and oil and gas sectors are positively affected in terms of export volume, while mineral, metal and service sectors are negatively impacted by the trade war.","Over the last five years, there have been several trade policy-related events with an emphasis for more protectionist policies. The most serious one is the US’s tariff increase on imports from China. The huge and unsustainable bilateral trade deficit, related to some extent to undervalued Chinese Renminbi (RMB), seems to be the reason that pushed the US to implement tariff increases against China (Xia et al., 2019). There are also other factors such as China’s systematic stealing of US intellectual property and bringing back some manufacturing to the US (Salvatore, 2020) with the strategy of “putting America first”.====In January 2018, the US imposed new tariffs on solar panels and washing machines imported from China. In March 2018, it imposed a tariff of 10 % and 25 % on aluminum and steel, respectively (Bekkers, 2019, Carvalho et al., 2019). In April 2018, China retaliated by putting tariffs on 128 goods imported from the US, including agricultural goods worth USD 2.4 billion. The US government reacted to this action by releasing a list of 1,300 Chinese goods (mainly from technology and pharmaceutical industries) worth USD 50 billion, that were taxed 25 % (Capie et al., 2020, Zhang, 2020). The Chinese government released another list of 106 goods, including cars, airplanes, and other products. The tariff war continued up to a stage where the tax imposed on Chinese goods reached USD 505 billion, affecting almost all Chinese exports (Chi & Qiao, 2019). Despite signing the Phase-One trade agreement with China in January 2020 and the Biden administration taking office in January 2021, the trade war is still ongoing, affecting the world economy (Capie et al., 2020, Palmer, 2023).====Trade policies play a vital role in shaping international trade and the world economy. Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016) claim that trade policies have effects on trade volume, industry, corporate performance, labor market, and the long-run economic growth. Countries come up with different trade policies to protect their domestic market, improve trade balance, and stimulate economic growth. The ongoing trade war between the US and China since 2018 is a good example to understand the remarkable impacts of trade policies on the global economy. Teimouri and Raeissadat (2019) argue that the trade war between the US and China is quite different from others since their cumulative GDP and population constitute over 40 % and 30 % of the world, respectively.====Both the US and China are important trade partners of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). These economic and trade relationships are materialized through different agreements such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). According to World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) data for 2019, the SSA exports to China and the US reach to USD 25.9 billion and USD 12.4 billion, respectively, in other terms 10.8 % and 5.1 % of the SSA total exports. The SSA imports from China and the US are worth USD 45.5 billion and USD 16.4 billion, respectively, reaching to 17.9 % and 6.4 % of total imports. The SSA mainly exports raw materials such as oil, minerals like gold and diamonds, and agricultural products like cocoa beans. Thus, a change in trade policy between these two countries may have implications on the SSA countries.====Although there are numerous studies on the impact of the trade war between the US and China on different countries, there are only few papers on Africa that reveal mixed results. Nyongesa (2019) uses descriptive statistics to analyze whether trade war has impacts on Chinese imports of energy and raw materials from Africa. He concludes that the trade war slightly stimulated Chinese interest in African resources. Using the first-year data of the trade war, Ndzendze (2020) finds that in comparison with other regions like Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean, African countries experienced a declining pattern when it comes to agricultural products in 2018 and 2019. Using the data from 1970 to 2017, Olayungbo (2019) employs a global vector autoregression (GVAR) model to forecast the possible effects of the trade war on the selected oil-exporting African countries. His findings show that the foreign output shock had a positive long-run effect for Gabon, Egypt, Angola, and Algeria, and negative long-run effect in Tunisia and Nigeria.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the impact of the change in trade policy between the US and China in the context of the SSA region. We use a CGE model based on GTAP to simulate the impact of tariff changes implemented since 2018 on the trade volume and economic growth of the SSA countries. We use the latest data from the GTAP 10 database. To minimize computational dimensions, we aggregate 141 regions/countries into 10 including Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Ghana, Rest of SSA, Rest of the World, the US, and China, and the sectors into eight, i.e., food, agriculture, mineral, metal, oil and gas, industry, service, and others. We use the standard GTAP model for calibration to obtain our benchmark equilibrium which is then compared to counterfactual equilibrium after introducing the tariff shocks.====This study contributes to literature in two folds. First, it is the first study that involves the SSA regions/countries in evaluating the impact of the recent tariff changes between the US and China. Second, it employs a CGE-GTAP model that gives both the direct and indirect impacts of policy scenarios. Additionally, the GTAP database uses a large coverage of input-output data that provides the interrelations between factors of production, sectors, companies, countries, and regions.====Our findings indicate that changes in trade policy between the US and China create opportunities for the SSA countries. The results show that their GDP increases up to 0.04 % on average, and both their exports and imports augment up to 0.02 and 0.05 on average, respectively, in different scenarios. Ethiopia and Kenya are the countries that record the largest increases in GDP, income, and expenditures, followed by Tanzania, Ghana, Rest of SSA, Nigeria, and South Africa, respectively. On the sectorial level, the results imply that agriculture, food, and oil and gas sectors are positively affected by the trade war in terms of export volume. South Africa, Tanzania, and Ethiopia are the most benefiting countries in agriculture and food sectors, while Nigeria and Ghana see their exports rising in oil and gas sector.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the findings of early papers on the trade war between the US and China. Section 3 presents the CGE model, GTAP database, and simulation scenarios.

The LDCs face some of the most rudimentary challenges related to trade participation and competitiveness. The challenges identified in the paper have been empirically validated using Fuzzy AHP modelling to decipher the priority weights. The findings reveal that ‘infrastructural and logistical constraints’ is the most imperative challenge followed by ‘limited FDI inflows’ and ‘inadequate development of SME clusters. The remaining challenges include: inadequate aid-for-trade, dismal LDC participation through the RTA/FTA route, lack of robust industrial policy, constraints in value chain upgradation, limited FDI. The study is beneficial for industry and provides useful inputs for policy-making. It helps in ascertaining optimal resource allocation for the purpose of enhancing trade competitiveness and economic development.","Global Value Chain (GVC) activities are distributed across different geographies, and usually, lead firm decides on the location of the value-added activities including what to outsource and what to accomplish in-house. In fact, the concept of GVCs involves the entire production process bringing a product from its commencement through production to its end use and beyond (Gereffi & Fernandez-Stark, 2016). Often, high value-added activities like R&D, branding, and design are firm’s in-house activities, while assembling or manufacturing activities may be outsourced to labour-intensive locations in developing countries (Gereffi, 2019, Cuervo-Cazurra and Pananond, 2023). Gradually, suppliers in the emerging markets acquire skills, gain knowledge and upgrade to high value-added activities.====The process of upgrading requires structural transformation, economic development, and robust industrial policies (Kuroiwa, 2016==== For instance, through a case study of apparel cluster in Torreon Mexico, Bair & Gereffi (2001) analysed how GVC participation and linkages leads to upgrading. Apparel supplier of Torreon entered the chain through assembly stage; however, they acquired the skills to develop expertise in trimming, labelling, and finishing. By 2000, these suppliers became full package suppliers by developing the expertise in exports and distribution. In fact, Azmeh & Nadvi (2014) noted that Asian garment manufacturers who once were the suppliers of lead firms in GVCs are now undertaking several high-value added tasks like design, distribution, and manufacturing. The study has also argued that GVC activities are shaped by the lead firms and several factors including supply-side factors, business environment, fiscal incentives, and trade openness determines the integration and disintegration of location of the GVC.====Today, the least developed countries (LDCs) continue to face rudimentary challenges pertaining to GVC linkages and upgrading. These challenges are related to their socio-economic conditions, infrastructure, logistics, and work environment to name a few (Saslavsky & Shepherd (2014)). Several firms from Asian economies like Hong Kong and Taiwan who once were the supplier to advanced countries have now become trans-national manufacturers and are running their operations in more than one country. A good example is Foxconn, a leading component supplier that now holds a dominant position in the value chain (Buckley & Strange, 2015). On the contrary, Cambodia, an LDC of of ASEAN lacks upgrading in GVC due to several challenges including lack of robust industrial policy, trade openness, and linkages with domestic firms (Keane, 2021).====Though Southeast Asia has transformed itself into a global manufacturing hub and a key player in the GVC architecture, yet the limited participation of its LDCs is worth exploring. This is primarily due to two factors. First, ASEAN as a region is now a part of world’s largest regional bloc i.e. Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). To reap the benefits in terms of knowledge and capabilities, these LDCs must improve their GVC linkages and upgrade themselves in the value chain. Second, the not so diverse portfolio of GVC participation of these LDCs remains a concern. For instance, the LDCs of ASEAN have traditionally specialised in labour-intensive industries e.g. apparel sector by utilising Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). However, in recent times, more capital-intensive sectors like automotive components, and electronics have intended to move their production facilities to these locations. For example, in Cambodia, Japanese firms are shifting their operations due to high-labour cost and labour shortages in the existing operations facility based in China and Vietnam (Banga & te Velde (2020); Kuroiwa, 2014; OECD, 2022).====A study by Shepherd (2016) discussed that GVCs activity is limited in LDCs due to the higher trade cost compared to other developing countries. In ASEAN, three out of ten members are classified as LDC. These countries face some the common challenges related to their weak industrial policy, high trade cost and underdeveloped infrastructure (Kuroiwa, 2016). These challenges limit their ability to upgrade in the GVC. Owing to the importance of GVCs and the challenges faced by ASEAN LDCs therein, it is imperative to study and prioritize these challenges. In this paper, we identify some critical challenges faced by the three LDCs of ASEAN viz. Cambodia, Myanmar and Lao PDR in GVC integration. For this, we employ a multi-dimensional modelling approach ==== Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP), to help us decipher the priority weightages. Our study responds to the following concerns, and would help improve policy preparedness and optimal resource allocation:====This remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections. The second section comprises of a thematic review of the GVC literature. The third section presents a relevant description of the three ASEAN LDCs in the form of country case lets including relevant policy frameworks with suitable examples. In the fourth section, we identify and discuss seven challenges faced by these LDCs in GVC integration. In the fifth and sixth sections, we present a step-by-step analysis and consequently the modelling results using the F-AHP method.

Comparing these agreements to an agreement involving all countries/sectors, we find that welfare is always larger in the multilateral agreement. This is because several sectors are often excluded from the bilateral agreements, and not all countries would have a bilateral agreement with others. The sectors that are often excluded from the agreements are agriculture, as these sectors are often deemed ‘sensitive’ in negotiations and are protected by high initial tariffs.","The withdrawal of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the pivot to bilateral agreements by the U.S. is one example of the change in global trade policy noted by Bekkers (2019) and Koopman et al. (2020)—i.e., the pull-back from globalization.==== Proponents for the bilateral approach argue that these agreements can achieve more since they are individually negotiated rather than considering the benefits of more than two countries and that multilateral agreements have become too unwieldy and large (Richter, 2014).==== In addition, it is noted that for wealthier countries, such as the U.S., bilateral negotiations create more leverage given the much greater size of their economy relative to potential partners (Williams, 2018). The opposing view is that bilateral trade agreements take long to negotiate, and that each new agreement must be ratified (by Congress for the U.S., for example) (Wharton, 2017). In a global sense, bilateral agreements also have the difficulty that they are often implemented one at a time, so that the gains made in the negotiations, e.g., tariff reductions, opening a new tariff-rate quota (TRQ), removal of non-tariff measures (NTMs), might not be relevant if countries provide more access to others in future agreements.====In addition to what agreements to pursue, there is a question of what goods to include in any trade agreement. That is, despite the best trade outcome for the world being free trade, most nations impose restrictions on imports that are usually advocated by and greatly benefit a small minority of producers in a country at the expense of consumers (Salvatore, 2019). This is particularly the case for agriculture, with several commodities deemed to be ‘sensitive’ due to heavy lobbying from interest groups (Jean et al., 2010). In terms of further WTO multilateral reform, Brooks (2019) argues that the failure for additional reform is in part because of agriculture. And there has been a failure to reform many of these sectors over time. For example, Griffith et al. (1993) note that many developed countries isolate domestic dairy producers from world market conditions. Twenty years later, it was still noted that the dairy sector was one of the most protected sectors in the world (Owen and Winchester, 2014).====To determine which path is optimal for countries in the case of TPP, we use a ‘Nash in Nash’ approach in an applied general equilibrium model (GTAP). General equilibrium models are very popular for analyzing a wide range of issues, including the effect of trade reforms (Ghaith et al., 2021). Our model iterates over solutions for bilateral agreements for every combination of traded sectors with every other TPP partner. We assume that the country negotiates and enters into the bilateral agreement which maximizes its welfare as long as it does not lower the welfare of its partner in the agreement (i.e., every country will accept a deal which does not lower its welfare). In subsequent iterations (i.e., the Nash aspect), each country reviews its existing bilateral agreements and, depending on the trade agreements that are most beneficial, it may keep the agreements in place, modify them, or even cancel them altogether, again if the partner in the agreement is not made worse off. Once we arrive at a Nash equilibrium for the bilateral agreements, we compare the results to one of a multilateral agreement, examining which approach generates the largest welfare gains. We focus on ‘sensitive’ commodities.",How Bilateral Trade Deals Get in the Way of Multilateral Agreements: Why WTO is marginalized,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893823000480,Available online 5 June 2023,2023,Research Article,2.0

The reasons for the imbalance include a significant increase in demand for housing due to population growth including net immigration, and a severe decline in construction output in the wake of the financial crisis with activity slow to increase in the last decade. Estimates from both the Central Bank of Ireland (Conefrey & Staunton, 2019) and the Economic and Social Research Institute (Bergin & Garcia-Rodriguez, 2020) suggest that Ireland requires in the region of 28,000–35,000 new dwellings each year for the next ten years to keep pace with projected population growth. However, the number of new housing units has been substantially below this level over the last decade (see Fig 1). More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has served to exacerbate Ireland’s housing supply problem. As the construction industry was shut down for several months during various lockdown periods in 2020 and 2021, the pace of building new homes slowed considerably. Because of this, the short-term supply and demand mismatch has widened. The lack of housing has led to numerous economic and social challenges in Ireland including increased levels of homelessness, high rents and house prices and difficulties for many people in purchasing affordable homes. With regard to the latter, as housing supply has not kept up with housing demand in recent years, the imbalance between the two has led to both house prices and rents increasing faster than household incomes.====Given this widely acknowledged imbalance in the Irish residential market, policy measures are particularly focussed on significantly increasing the supply of housing over the medium-term (Egan, Kenny, & McQuinn, 2022). In September 2021, The Irish Government released a new housing plan, “====” (Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, 2021). This initiative has the largest ever housing budget in Irish history and aims to transform Ireland’s housing system, with funding being provided from various sources including the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency. The plan states supporting homeownership and increasing affordability as one of its overarching objectives. The plan targets annual new dwelling completions of 33,000 units up to 2030; an ambitious target given completions averaged in the region of 14,000 per year over the previous decade.====A key consideration for the Irish Government will involve striking a balance to ensure increased government spending aimed at increasing housing supply is not off-set by rising construction costs, house price inflation or other possible negative impacts to the wider economy. In light of this policy consideration, this paper examines the impact of government spending on the Irish construction sector and housing market using a structural econometric model of the Irish economy with a specific construction block. The inclusion of a specific construction sector in model of the Irish economy is motivated by the importance of the sector historically. Employment in the construction sector (NACE sectors F and L) represented 6.7 % (around 168,000 people) of total employment in 2021Q4 having peaked at 13 % (around 282,000) in 2006Q4. Crucially within our econometric analysis, we compare the results of an economy wide versus a sector specific government stimulus on the construction sector, property market and wider economy.====While the literature on quantifying the impact of expansionary fiscal policy on macroeconomic variables such as output, consumption, investment and employment is extensive (see for example Baxter and King (1993), Blanchard and Perotti, 2002, de Castro Fernández and Hernández de Cos (2008), Perotti, 2004, and Papaioannou (2019)), papers which include the reaction of the residential construction and housing market to a change in government spending are more limited. Much of the empirical links between policy and house prices has focused on monetary intervention (see for example Bauer, 2017; Hülsewig and Rottmann, 2021; Iacoviello, 2005; Iacoviello and Neri, 2010; Musso, Neri, & Stracca, 2010; Del Negro and Otrok, 2007, Wadud et al., 2012; Yang, Wang, & Campbell, 2010). From the relatively scarce work relating fiscal policy to the housing market, there is a lack of consensus in empirical literature about the effect of increasing government spending policies on residential investment and house prices. Ramey, Shapiro (1998) include the response of residential investment to an increase in government spending and find that it falls substantially and statistically significantly. Edelberg, Eichenbaum, and Fisher (1999) investigate the consequences of an exogenous increase in U.S. government purchases and find that in response to such a shock, employment, output, and non-residential investment rise, while real wages, residential investment, and consumption expenditures fall. The authors find that a positive shock to government purchases induces a broad-based expansion in non-residential investment along with a delayed fall in consumption expenditures. The latter occurs mostly via a reduction in durable consumer good expenditures, defined to include investment in housing. Wigren and Wilhelmsson (2007) examine investment in construction in Western Europe and find that public infrastructure policies have an effect on short-run economic growth but only a weak effect on the long run. Using US quarterly data, from 1955 to 2000, Mountford and Uhlig (2005) find that government spending shocks crowd out both residential and non-residential investment without causing interest rates to rise. Fatás and Mihov (2001) find that while the response of overall investment in government expenditures is ambiguous, residential investment responds positively. The authors point out that the increase is small, however. Analysing empirical evidence from the US, the UK, Germany and Italy, Afonso and Sousa (2012) provide a detailed evaluation of the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy and find that government spending shocks have a positive effect on house prices which persists for almost 20 quarters. In contrast, Agnello and Sousa (2013) analyse the impact of fiscal policy on asset prices using a panel vector auto-regressive (PVAR) approach and quarterly data for ten industrialized countries and find that positive fiscal shocks lead to a gradual and persistent decrease in housing prices. Finally, Andres, Bosca and Ferri (2015) show that after a positive government spending shock, house prices fall across various measures of residential property inflation. The authors find that the decrease is more intense when prices are measured by a quality constant Laspeyres index (about 3.2 % points after one year) but lasts longer when a Fisher index of house prices is used (after nine quarters the fall in housing prices is still significant).====The aim of this paper is to add to this relatively scarce body of literature by examining the role that government spending can have on the construction sector and residential property market. The Irish case provides a particularly good case study for such an analysis given the current shortage of available housing units to meet the level of demand, the overall importance of the construction sector to the Irish economy, as well as the proposed policy response of the Irish Government. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the model used in our empirical analysis, Section 3 discusses establishing the link between government spending and housing supply in the Irish economy while Section 4 presents the empirical results of our policy simulations and discusses the findings in the context of policy lessons.

The long-run model estimated in one-regime setting with no structural break and in sample-split setting with multiple structural breaks provides dominant support to the sustainability of CA and solvency of IBC. The policy makers in the countries with surpluses in CA, such as China and Russia, need to manage upward pressure on domestic currency, encourage domestic investment, and seek opportunities for outward FDI. The central bank interventions in ====, accompanied by both short-term portfolio and long-term direct investments overseas, would help relieve upward pressure on domestic currency and make productive use of ====. The policy focus in the countries with deficits in CA, such as Brazil, India and South Africa, should be to accelerate productivity, boost exports, bolster saving, and implement ==== to ensure the sustainability of CA and solvency of IBC.","The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) bloc of nations are the fastest growing and the largest emerging market economies of the world. They jointly share just under half of the global population and collectively account for at least 23% of the global gross domestic product and 16% of the global trade. China and India dominate BRICS in terms of the magnitudes of their gross domestic product (GDP) and population. Russia, and again China, dominate in terms of their current account positions. Both China and Russia experienced robust surpluses in their current accounts, and they have been the net exporters of capital and thus the buyers of assets overseas. The staggering surpluses of 10.45–17.47% of GDP in Russia during 1999–2001 and of 8.42–9.95% of GDP in China during 2006–08 were followed by substantial shrinkages, however. Brazil, India and South Africa witnessed recurrent deficits in their current accounts, and they borrow capital from international financial markets/institutions to fund their investment and foster their expansion. The surplus in current account puts an upward pressure on the external value of domestic currency. Strong currency weakens the competitiveness of exports, induces the propensity to import, and imperils the sustainability of current account. By contrast, large and persistent deficits in current account tend to trigger sudden stops and large reversals of capital inflows, and lead to the insolvency of current account and the default on foreign debt. The current account deficits beyond a threshold level become unsustainable and warrant policy corrections.====The sustainability of current account in the BRICS countries is central to the stability of both regional and global economy, given the significant surge in their cross-border linkages through international trade, capital flows, market interdependence, and the regional/global supply chain and sub-chain networks. Husted (1992) determines the sustainability of current account (CA) and solvency of intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) in terms of the presence of cointegration between exports (inflow of resources) and imports (outflow of resources). The empirical research conducted in this vein has provided a mixed and inconclusive evidence; see Singh, 2007, Singh, 2016 for the surveys. Despite an outpouring of research on current account, the question of whether current accounts are sustainable in BRICS remains virtually unexplored. This study fills the research gap and undertakes a descriptively comprehensive and statistically robust assessment of the sustainability of CA and solvency of IBC in the BRICS group of countries. The study contributes to the extant literature on the following counts.====First, the policy prescriptions for external sustainability depend on both economic conditions and financing needs of the individual countries, given the significant heterogeneity and wide dispersion across BRICS in terms of their external positions and socio-economic characteristics. The study conducts a country-by-country time-series analysis, as opposed to commonly undertaken group-based panel data analysis, and provides country-specific assessment of the sustainability of CA. Such an analysis is useful to resolve the heteroscedasticity of residuals (variance), which creeps in panel data models estimated on a highly heterogenous group of countries like BRICS, and to facilitate the formulation and evaluation of country-specific policies.====Second, the results often tend to be sensitive to the methodology employed to estimate the model. The academic debates and economic controversies — which surface in almost every sphere of empirical research — could be partially ascribed to the use of different methodologies and test statistics across studies (Singh, 2019). This study deviates from the common practice of drawing firm conclusions based on the estimates of single or select estimators. It estimates the model using several single-equation and system estimators in both one-regime and sample-split settings, and takes a robust account of the evidence.====Third, previous studies have either ignored structural breaks or have considered at the most two breaks. In fact, multiple structural breaks are inherent to the models estimated on longer time spans. This study extends the previous empirics and newly examines the sustainability of external accounts in the presence of multiple structural breaks that could occur over ==== as well as ==== time periods.====The remainder of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 undertakes a descriptive analysis of the macroeconomic and current account dynamics in BRICS. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4 discusses the empirical results.

A consequence of this is a political backlash against globalization in many developed countries. Such negative sentiments have intensified in recent years with disruptions to the global economy.==== This has raised serious challenges for governments in terms of effective implementation of policies that reduce income disparities, while continuing to reap the benefits of being integrated with the global economy.====A body of recent empirical work (see, for example, Sethi et al., 2021, Bittencourt et al., 2019, Tridico, 2018, Cabral et al., 2016 and Asteriou et al., 2014) points to several dimensions of globalization that are affecting income disproportionately and thereby contributing to the rise in inequality. These include trade and market integration, along with financial development encompassing foreign direct investment (FDI)/equity flows, and other financial indicators such as bank credit and stock market volatility.====While inequality among countries have reduced in the last quarter of a century, the same within countries have risen, with considerable variations among countries and regions. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2020a), the ratio of average income (after taxes) of the richest 20% of the population to the poorest 20% was 5.4 to 1, with considerable variation across countries and regions.==== Benchmarked against the OECD average, Chile, Mexico, US, and Turkey have seen substantial rises in income inequality. In contrast, Australia and New Zealand in the Oceania region witnessed a much smaller increase. Newer EU members such as Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, as well as established members such as France, Netherlands, Ireland, Poland, and Belgium, closed the inequality gap by increasing the share of the bottom 20% incomes to above OECD averages.==== The above-mentioned variation in inequalities have further escalated due to the global recession triggered by the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008.====While it may be tempting for policymakers to point towards rapid pace of globalization over the past decades as a key causal reason behind increasing income inequality across countries, Helpman (2018) comprehensively analyses this complex relationship and finds that forces other than globalization have more to do with rising income inequality. A reasonable body of literature prior to this cautions against blaming only globalization for rising within- and cross-country income inequality in developed economies (see, for instance, Ravallion, 2018, Coyle, 2016, Rodrik, 2018, Bourguignon, 2016, Milanovic, 2016, Gozgor and Ranjan, 2017). Many argue that globalization through trade liberalization and increased financial integration has in fact improved overall incomes, in relative and absolute terms, narrowing the inequality gap worldwide. Keefer and Knack (2002), Berg et al. (2012), Jaumotte et al. (2013) subscribe to the school of thought that suggests that even though globalization raises income, inequality emerges from an unfair system. The absence of pre-requisite social, economic, and political conditions in the policymaking process prevents the benefits of growth from being distributed more equally.====Clearly, the predicted impact of globalization on long-run intra-country income inequality remains mixed in the existing literature. These varying results often depend on several factors such as the driving mechanism, the level of economic development and country-specific characteristics within both industrialized and developing economies, and the methodologies adopted to evaluate them. One key missing aspect among the body of studies so far on this subject is that all studies are either cross country or panel data based. This implies that the policy advisories based on such earlier methods cannot identify country-specific factors. As an example, cross-country studies on the EU have not been able to identify whether there exist differential impacts of globalization on income inequality in the long run in case of UK and France. If it does exist, the policy advisories for dealing with the same would be different too. This gap in existing empirical work provides us with the impetus to examine further the long-run relationship between these two key economic variables whose interactions are complex and multi-dimensional.====In contrast to the sizeable body of existing empirical work on this topic, with the latest being a meta regression analysis by Heimberger (2020), we apply the Yamamoto and Kurozumi (2006) technique in a multivariate cointegrating framework. This is our preferred choice on two counts. First, this framework can estimate in one step the multilateral relationships between all the variables being studied. This allows us to examine the long-run block non-causality between the variables, which justifies our choice of this methodology compared to other econometric tools explored in recent studies.==== Second, this approach ensures that results and policy recommendations are country-specific and not affected by homogeneity assumption issues which can occur if a panel framework such as Tridico (2018) is adopted instead.==== Nolan et al. (2019), specifically highlights the importance of complementing aggregate cross-country econometric analysis with in-depth investigation of individual countries while analyzing drivers of income inequality through a common analytic framework.====Therefore, we contribute to the empirical literature in the following ways. First, we address the causal impact between globalization and inequality while accounting for endogeneity, hitherto not extensively elaborated in the literature for OECD members, except for Gaston and Rajaguru (2009) in the Australian context. Second, our analysis concentrates on OECD countries and further classifies them across different geographical regions over the period 1980–2017, which has not previously been attempted in a multivariate framework.====Guided by recent empirical work, country specific long- and short-run causal relationships are examined. We utilize the within country Gini coefficient, the KOF globalization index,==== real GDP per capita, terms of trade (====), minimum wages, and union density as key variables in our empirical analysis.==== Our dataset covers 24 OECD countries over nearly four decades, with available time-series data for all variables.====Because different sub-components of globalization affect income inequality differently, we also analyze impulse response shocks to these different sub-components to gauge the varying impacts of economic, social, or political globalization on income inequality.==== Furthermore, we analyze whether these shocks, responding to uncertainties from rising globalization, is uniform for a specific sub-component across a geographical region.==== Our key objective is to ascertain whether forces of globalization have caused long-run income inequality in developed countries and which sub-component of it, if any, drives this empirical link.====Our results inform policymakers in developed countries that first, there is no clear evidence that rapid globalization over past decades is the key cause of rising long-run inequality. Second, most countries in our sample that do have a long-run relationship seem to have achieved the reverse causal impact of globalization, reducing inequality. Finally, contrary to existing empirical work, our impulse response (IR) breakdown across the sub-components of globalization suggests economic globalization, which also subsumes financial globalization, is not a primary contributor to long-run inequality for developed countries.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the key determinants of income inequality as analyzed in the literature. Section 3 outlines the data and methodological framework used in our empirical analysis. We conduct our empirical analysis by applying the Yamamoto and Kurozumi (2006) approach to test for the presence of long-run Granger non-causality between our chosen variables. Section 4 discusses results and reports the key findings of our paper. Section 5 summarizes suggested policy implications. Section 6 concludes.",Does globalization drive long-run inequality within OECD countries?

Data analysis techniques, namely multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical classification, are employed to hold the analysis in alignment with the research aim. The study investigates four groups of Tunisian insurance and pension funds, each characterized by its own investment challenges regarding alternative assets. Subsequently, the study examines certain improvement areas, for instance, reforming the legislative framework to facilitate a supportive ==== environment, ensure information symmetry and transparency, etc. The approach of this study is novel for being the first of its kind to explore Tunisian insurance and pension ‘funds’ investments in alternative assets through data analysis techniques. In view of the fact that the history of research on this topic has been brief and fragmented, limited mostly to mature markets, the outcomes of this research can offer useful insights for policymakers in the emerging economies, particularly those undergoing reforms in young democracies like Tunisia in Africa, Eastern and Central Europe, and Latin America.","Alternative asset investment (AAI) has emerged as a relatively contemporary approach in the public-pension investment domain (Peng & Wang, 2020). Unlike traditional investment that comprises mainly of fixed-income securities (e.g., treasury and corporate bonds) and public equity (e.g., stocks), i.e., traded frequently in the open market, AAI involves financial assets, namely, private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, and real assets (e.g., real estate, gold, etc.), i.e., managed conventionally by a hedge funds or a private equity company (Peng & Wang, 2020). Some categories of AAI (e.g., private equity and venture capital) have outpaced traditional investments (e.g., public equity) with superior long run rates of return (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005, Harris et al., 2014; Ivashina and Lerner, 2019). As a result, the AAI allocations have witnessed a remarkable rise among institutional investors with a long run investment horizon (e.g., pension funds and insurance corporations) worldwide since 2001 (Cummins et al., 2018; Giuzio and Rousová, 2019; Peng & Wang, 2020). As a corresponding outcome, the holdings of short-term (<1-year maturity) and medium-term (between 1 and 5 years maturity) assets in 34 OECD countries, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America in particular have seen drastic declines, implying the long-term horizon pension funds as a propitious option for diversification (IOPS, 2017, Ivashina and Lerner, 2018). For example, the average illiquid asset allocation for pension funds jumped from 4% in 1997 to 25% in 2017 in seven largest pension-holding countries (Broeders et al., 2021) and from 9% in 2001 to 34% in 2022 in the US alone (Kozlowski, 2022). Moreover, the world especially the developed countries have witnessed rising holdings of alternative assets by the insurance companies, from 8.9% to 9.6% of total investment assets over 2018, with strong signs of ongoing rises in the coming years. Among all alternative asset classes in insurers’ portfolios, investments in infrastructure and alternative funds are recorded to be the fastest-growing (Giuzio and Rousová, 2019).====Extant literature highlights a number of reasons behind the diversification to AAI which are arguably non-exhaustive, hence require further investigation. However, many of these reasons seem to be influenced by the instrumental role played by new investment policies and regulatory reforms (Andonov et al., 2018). From the policy perspective, Chiboub and Benjelloun (2020) classified the pension markets in two categories: (a) countries with an Anglo-Saxon financial heritage, i.e, the US, England, Ireland, etc. and (b) those with a European financial heritage, e.g., Germany, France, Denmark, etc. The latter group of countries have certain policy bindings. For instance, Danish pension funds are not entitled to put more than 40% of their portfolio investments in risky assets, German funds cannot invest more than 30% in European equities and 25% in European real estate, whereas Portuguese pension funds are restricted to 50% of their investments in European real estate and real estate loans (Sánchez Serrano & Peltonen, 2020). These countries also bear the full brunt of the trade union regulations and are historically more concerned about their social image being known to be law-abiding welfare economies.==== On the contrary, Anglo-Saxon countries have no such constraints and are limited only by their spirit and creativity, implying higher efficiency that European pension funds could enjoy if they had more freedom in making their investment choices (Chiboub & Benjelloun, 2020). Given the outperforming AAI, insurance and pension funds in many parts of the world are beginning to wonder and think about their investment policies, and making possible regulatory reforms to provide access to the illiquidity premium and superior prospects of diversification and returns (Ashcroft et al., 2016).====In alignment with the global trend, pension systems in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have reached a crossroads. Most countries of the region set up their pension schemes in the 1970 s (Robalino, 2005) and, as of today, all countries except for Lebanon have some type of pension programme for employees in both public and private sectors, comprising a relatively modest average, i.e., about 35% of the labour force (World Bank, 2017). In parallel with the pension funds, the insurance sector also enlarged in the region, consisting largely of assets relating to short-term property investment and casualty insurance (Robalino, 2005). Only 36.7% of the work force are making effective contributions to the social insurance schemes, i.e., well below the global average (i.e., 53.7%) (ILO, 2021). Many economies in the region went through the process of privatising state-owned assets and reforming corporation tax schemes to unlock the potential of AAI. This was reflected in the expansion that the private equity sectors had already seen during 1994–2005, 41% of which were pulled in 2005 alone, revealing the prospect of this method of finance in the region (OECD, 2006). Among all, Tunisia has emerged as a regional forerunner, exhibiting a new dynamic of securing high levels of contributions from a large volume of the working citizens, and prompting pension funds and insurance companies (institutional investors) to seek diversification into new asset classes (AAI) through innovations in social security policy and investment (UN-ESCWA, 2019, ILO, 2021).====Given the AAI features of outperformance (alpha), illiquidity premium and diversification (AIMA, 2019), and Tunisia’s potential in long-term investment horizon, it is of significance to focus on investigating alternative assets and developing an understanding of the barriers that prevent Tunisian pension funds and insurance companies (CNRPS==== and CNSS====) from opening up to the world of AAI and facing complex market reality. Also, as the largest pension fund and the second largest institutional investor in Tunisia (i.e., CNRPS) is limited by law to invest at least 50% in government bonds, a maximum of 30% in stock exchanges, a maximum of 15% in real estate, and less than 5% in private equity (OECD, 2022), we like to explore whether the diversification in investments is constrained by public policies or regulations, or there is existence of more structural reasons. In other words, to resolve the conundrum, we like to address the following questions: What factors divert the attention of Tunisian institutional investors from the AAI market? and what kind of policy support should be put in place to encourage these new vehicles as investment diversifiers?",Relocating investments by Tunisian insurance and pension funds towards alternative assets opportunities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893823000285,Available online 29 March 2023,2023,Research Article,7.0

However, despite attempts to develop a policy of tax harmonization, fragmentation is noted in the EU VAT system, which creates an obstacle to effective trade in the common market (Kowal & Przekota, 2021), and the simultaneous effect of many tax rates exacerbates the problem (Sokolovska & Sokolovskyi, 2015).====The policy of tax federalism is the basis of tax policy and relationships between the EU and its member states in the tax sphere (Hoeller, 1996, Hinarejos, 2013). The concept of a common market implies the removal of obstacles to free trade in order to merge national markets into a single effective internal market. Ideally, to minimize economic distortions in the tax policy of an integration association, only one standard VAT rate should be applied (Bénassy-Quéré et al., 2014). Therefore, the EU has repeatedly tried to make it a harmonized tax that does not distort the conditions of competition (Diamond and Mirrlees, 1971, Institute for Fiscal Studies, 2011, Tudor, 2015).====The crisis phenomena in the EU economy are fueling research interest in evaluating the tax gap and the effectiveness of VAT collection in different EU countries; since this gap is considered a growing cause of negative consequences for economic policy (Abramovsky et al., 2017; Kalyva et al., 2016; Durán-Cabré et al., 2019). The policy of the EU states formulates the goal of combating tax evasion and tax fraud in direct and indirect taxation. Consequently, the exact determination of the VAT gap can be a fundamental step in assessing its effectiveness and revealing the extent of tax evasion (Nerudova & Dobranschi, 2019).====Thus, the aim of the present study is to analyze the impact of the standard VAT rate and the number of existing rates on the effectiveness of VAT collection in the old and new EU member states. It was assumed, that the EU countries with tax systems characterized by a small number of reduced VAT rates, demonstrate higher efficiency of tax collection, and the VAT gap is smaller.","Longevity of EU membership and VAT practices: Dependencies, Contradictions And Implications",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893823000236,Available online 16 March 2023,2023,Research Article,8.0

For example, according to a study by the Pew Research Center, “…….the share that sees defending against terrorism as a top priority has remained fairly steady: Around seven-in-ten Americans or more have cited it as a top priority in 17 surveys conducted by the Center since January 2002 (the first time the question was asked), when 83 % of Americans cited it” (Gramlich, 2018). Similarly, the results of a recent Eurobarometer survey indicated that “…Terrorism was ranked the number one concern in eight EU countries and was in the top two in every EU country except for Greece.” (Kroet, 2016). The natural response of these countries is therefore to increase their expenditures on counterterrorism. Using data from the Office of Management and Budget, we find that the U.S. increased its share of expenditure on homeland security from 0.58 % in 1990 to 1.15 % in 2016. So ultimately how big is the impact of terrorism on the economy? We advance the research on this issue in this paper.====Prior research indicates that terrorism adversely affects the economy. Gaibulloev and Sandler (2008) find that an increase of 1 transnational incident per million population reduces growth by 0.4 %. The effect of domestic incidents is about half. Meierrieks and Gries (2013) find that terrorism adversely affects growth in the Granger sense. Gaibulloev and Sandler (2019) find that the economic and financial ramifications of large-scale terrorist attacks are transitory. The impact on GDP per capita growth is minimal since most nations sustain insignificant terrorist attacks annually. The well-to-do diversified nations can absorb these attacks with little macroeconomic consequences; however, those nations that are developing or plagued with terrorism are adversely impacted. Overall, most researchers find a negative effect of terrorism on growth.====There is another strand of research that examines the effect of terrorism on trade. Bandyopadhyay et al. (2018) find that overall trade, manufactured goods imports, and exports are generally negatively impacted by domestic and transnational terrorism. Further, they note insignificant marginal differential impacts between domestic and transnational terrorism. De Sousa et al. (2018) using a game-theoretic framework examine the influence of transnational terrorism’s location on security and international trade. They find that the negative spillover effect on a country’s trade is positively correlated to the proximity to the source of terrorism with distant countries benefitting from an increase in security through additional trading.====Most of the research assumes constant marginal effects of terrorism. We conjecture that the marginal impact varies depending on local conditions, such as immigration. We model these non-linearities by considering the interaction of terrorism with immigrants’ quality of life captured by the foreign-born unemployment rate and globalization index.====Prior literature suggests that immigrants can be perpetrators as well as victims of terrorist attacks (Helbling & Meierrieks, 2020, p. 4). A recent example of a case in which an immigrant was the perpetrator was the stabbing of Sir David Amess (a British Member of Parliament) in 2021 (Faulkner & Kleiderman, 2021). A report from the U.S. White House (2018) describes that “… roughly three in four individuals convicted of international terrorism-related charges since September 11, 2001, were foreign-born.”==== According to a paper by the Center for Immigration Studies, 104 Islamic terrorists entered the E.U. between 2014 and 18, and the vast majority of them stayed inside E.U. for a long time using the pretext of seeking asylum.==== However, immigrants can be victims too. Indeed, McAlexander (2020) considers the evidence in Western Europe between 1980 and 2004 and finds that an increase in immigration is related to an increase in terrorism, primarily because immigrants are targets.====There can potentially be major economic impacts in either case. When immigrants act as perpetrators, the government of the host country is forced to divert more resources to counterterrorism. Also, more terrorist attacks create business uncertainty. On the other hand, attacks on immigrants can also affect the economy. First, it can reduce immigration and that can lead to labor shortages. Second, it can discourage foreign direct investment. Finally, it can also discourage foreign tourists, which impacts countries with major tourism industries.====Therefore, while terrorism and immigration can individually affect the economy as is shown in prior literature (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2018, Ortega and Peri, 2014, etc.), we hypothesize that they interact with each other. In that case, the net effect of terrorism will vary depending on certain attributes of immigration.====There are several important takeaways from this paper. First, we find that in OECD countries (which is our sample), GDP per capita is adversely affected by domestic terrorism but the impact of transnational terrorism on GDP is not clear. Second, we show that an increase in the foreign-born unemployment rate in a given year adversely affects GDP per capita next year. In our analysis comparing a country’s output when there is no problem of terrorism vs. the situation when there are domestic terrorist attacks in one year (equal to one standard deviation), we note that there is a reduction in per capita income of 9 % in one year. This effect is more pronounced with regard to transnational terrorism. These two results demonstrate that peace is valuable, and OECD countries will gain by adopting policies to reduce the problem of terrorism. We note that a one-unit increase in the foreign-born unemployment rate in one year in the presence of domestic terrorism reduces GDP per capita in the next year by approximately $11.25 in PPP terms in the OECD countries. However, if the foreign-born unemployment rate was the same as the native-born unemployment rate, then the corresponding reduction in GDP per capita would have been only $2 in PPP terms. A similar result was found to hold for transnational terrorism indicating that policies that close the gap between foreign-born and native-born unemployment rates help the economy.====The structure of the paper is as follows: We review the literature in Section 2. We describe our data and econometric methodology in Section 3. We present our findings in Section 4.

If sender countries chose 100 % import tariffs and export taxes on trade with Russia, Russia’s GDP would decline by 3–7 % due to the resulting significant reduction in exports. By contrast, the GDP loss for those countries would be 0.2 % for the European economies, but only about 0.05 % for Japan. Although unlikely, the effect of China’s participation in the sanctions would be more significant than that of India. There are concerns about food and energy crises due to economic sanctions against Russia, but the effect on food supplies would not be a serious problem for either senders or third parties. The impact on energy supplies would affect all senders to some extent; for example, there would be a 3% reduction of energy consumption and a 3–4 % rise in electricity and town gas prices in Japan.","In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, several countries—notably the United States and some European nations—demanded an immediate halt to the military invasion. Although military intervention is a common countermeasure to such military aggression, it is difficult to intervene against Russia, a nuclear power, considering the possibility that such intervention could trigger another world war. In addition, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, Russia renders the United Nations dysfunctional regarding management of the Russia–Ukraine war. Rather than intervening, the United States, Europe, and Japan have taken the lead in imposing economic sanctions, particularly the blockage of Russia’s fuel exports (natural gas, oil, and coal) to prevent Russia from earning foreign currency, and to restrict imports to impede Russian domestic economic activity. Those nations also decided to block access to financial markets and freeze the foreign currency and gold reserves of government agencies, and the personal assets of key government and business officials. The crisis triggered oil and wheat price hikes just after the war began, but prices returned to pre-crisis levels as of January 2023.====As the Russian veto has crippled the Security Council, the Security Council cannot impose the same kind of economic sanctions on Russia that it has imposed on Iran and North Korea. The UN General Assembly passed a withdrawal resolution by a majority vote. While it is not surprising that Russia and five other countries, including Belarus and North Korea, opposed the vote, the fact that 35 countries, including China and India, abstained shows that there are many countries in the world whose attitudes toward Russia differ significantly from those of Western countries. The economic sanctions have been imposed primarily by Western countries plus Japan. The “list of unfriendly countries” designated by Russia (dated March 5, 2022) indicates that only 48 countries and regions are imposing some form of sanctions.====In the work to assess the impacts of economic sanctions against Russia, we have not yet established common assumptions and analytical frameworks, because the full scope of the sanctions––sanction measures and countries involved––is still in flux, and the military invasion operation is ongoing. With a motivation like that of this study, Kumagai et al. (2022) use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that incorporates economies of agglomeration, à la Krugman (1991), to simulate prohibitively high transportation costs at the Russian border as an economic sanction. The results show that Russia’s GDP would decline by 15.8 % if logistics at all Russian borders were impeded, and by 4.6 % if logistics were affected at all Russian borders except that with China. The authors report that these logistical impediments would impact Japan, with a 1.7 % decline in automobiles and a 2 % decline in production in the textile, clothing, and food processing sectors, while Japan’s GDP would decline by just 0.1 %.==== Chepeliev et al. (2022) use a world trade dynamic CGE model based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) 10 Power Database (Chepeliev, 2020), to simulate the restriction of fossil fuel imports from Russia (natural gas, oil, coal, and petroleum products) by the European Union (EU) and other high-income countries; they find that that restriction would reduce imports by half in the short run and by 70–90 % in the long run. This would reduce Russia’s annual real income by 4–8 %, while the EU’s loss would be limited to about 0.04 % per year.====Economic sanctions were imposed on Russia after the outset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and during the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Those sanctions targeted specific sectors (especially oil), corporations, and individuals, rather than trade in general. Ahn and Ludema (2020) measure the impacts of these sanctions using firm- and individual-level data. Financial sanctions isolated Russia from global financial markets (Nivorozhkin and Castagneto-Gissey, 2016). However, the impacts of the sanctions were not as large as that of oil price fluctuations observed in the same period (Dreger et al., 2016). If sanctions had been imposed on a broader range of trade, Russia would not have been able to sustain its business activities with only natural resource exports; exit by firms would be accelerated by the resulting decline in trade (Iwasaki et al., 2016). The sanctions against Russia spilled over negatively to trade and direct investment between Russia and former Soviet Union countries (Sedrakyan, 2022).====As well as fossil fuel supplies from Russia, food supplies are also at stake globally (Dalheimer et al., 2021).==== This is a crucial problem, especially for low-income countries in Africa, which are reluctant to confront Russia with economic sanctions. Therefore, analyses of sanctions on Russia need to address the problem of food security, especially wheat. Since Ukraine, a breadbasket country, has been damaged by the war, food supplies from Russia have greater significance. As Kumagai et al. (2022) carefully consider, China’s participation in the sanctions would be crucial for their success. No matter how strict the sanctions imposed are, loopholes in sanctions against Russia would undermine their effectiveness and increase the burden on those affected by them. Belarus is likely to engage in reexports for Russia so that Russian can evade the sanctions. How effective would the sanctions be, with and without China and India? How much collateral damage would be imposed on third parties, such as African developing countries? How much damage would those countries incur were they to participate in the sanctions?====Economic sanctions can be seen as a reversal of economic integration, if we focus on the trade aspect, on issues such as Brexit (Dhingra et al., 2017, Hosoe, 2018, Ortiz Valverde and Latorre, 2020) and the US–Mexico–Canada Agreement (Burfisher et al., 2019, Hosoe, 2022; United States International Trade Commission, 2019). Brexit is a case of self-sanctioning by the United Kingdom (UK), who allowed the EU 27 to impose higher tariffs and other trade barriers in order to achieve UK economic sovereignty. Export controls share the same political goals—to prevent and/or stop warfare with economic sanctions—and can be analyzed by taking a similar approach (Hosoe, 2020, Shin and Balistreri, 2022).====Setting aside the question of whether economic sanctions would effectively force Russia to abandon its military invasion, this study examines whether and to what extent economic sanctions could damage the Russian economy and the extent to which the impact would be enhanced by enlarging the coalition. That is, like other economic studies on sanctions, we evaluate effectiveness of sanctions in terms of damage inflicted, while the political science literature generally evaluates effectiveness in terms of changes in the target country’s behavior (Felbermayr et al., 2021). Countries that impose sanctions are sure to incur losses; in that light, we also examine the impact on the world economy and the Japanese economy.====To these ends, we use a static world trade CGE model, as presented in Section 2, and assume that (1) the senders impose 100 % export taxes and import duties on Russia and on Belarus, and (2) the war halves the endowments of primary factors in Ukraine. We examine changes in various macro- and micro-economic variables that would result from these shocks. That is, we measure changes in bilateral trade, fossil fuel trade, sectoral production, and macroeconomic indicators of GDP and welfare (i.e., household consumption). Section 3 shows that Russia’s GDP would decrease by 3–7 % due to the significant decline in exports. The larger the number of sender countries, the greater the losses that Russia would incur. Among many potential senders, but this doesn’t seem likely, China’s participation would be more important than that of India. For senders, GDP losses would be 0.2 % in Europe and 0.05 % in Japan. Similar results are obtained when household consumption, rather than GDP, is used as a welfare indicator. To achieve a 1-USD loss of GDP for Russia, the senders’ GDP loss would have to be about 0.6 USD, if Western countries, Japan, India, and (unlikely) China participated in the sanctions. If every country but Russia and Belarus participated, Russia’s losses would be the largest among the six cases we consider here. However, the cost-benefit balance of sanctions would deteriorate considerably; the senders’ loss would increase to 0.9 USD for Russia’s loss of 1-USD GDP. We find that the sanctions against Russia and the destruction of the Ukrainian economy would affect food supplies little, even in developing countries, but they would affect energy supplies to some extent.

By using the difference-in-differences (DID) method, we find that TLP implementations result in a 3.4340-point increase in students' test scores and cognitive and noncognitive ability scores increased by 0.1631 and 0.0405 points, respectively. Results of mechanism tests show that this positive effect is explained by the improvement of teachers' efforts and enthusiasm, the increase of parental involvement in education, and positive student responses. Moreover, heterogeneity analysis results suggest that TLP implementations have a greater positive effect on achievements of some disadvantaged students, such as girls, non-only children, and those from relatively low-income families. This study highlights the benefits of ICT in education and reveals the positive role of parents, educators, and authorities in promoting student achievement and human capital accumulation. Furthermore, our findings complement the ==== on educational inequity and have some insights for China and other developing countries.","As a new generation, students are familiar with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) from an early age. ICT applications have gradually become an important component of high-quality education (Li and Ranieri, 2013, Luo et al., 2020). However, due to differences in economic and technological levels, there is a large gap between developing and developed countries in ICT in education. The latest report from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) showed that the computer-student ratio in developed countries such as the UK and the US has reached 1.25, however, in some developing countries, such as Brazil, Morocco, Turkey, and Vietnam, this ratio is about 0.25, which is only one-fifth of developed countries (OECD, 2020).====As a developing country, China is not much better off. The PISA investigated Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, which are the most developed regions in China, and the report suggests that the average computer-student ratio is above 0.5 slightly (OECD, 2020). The situation in rural areas is even worse. As represented in Table 1, in 2006, the computer-student ratios in rural primary schools, junior middle schools, and senior high schools were only 0.03, 0.05, and 0.08, respectively. In recent years, with the adoption of several initiatives including ICT in education in rural and distant locations, the situation has improved recently (Li & Ranieri, 2013), but the gap between urban and rural areas remains obvious.====Considering the disadvantages of ICT in education in rural China, the resulting digital divide may have a negative impact on student achievements (e.g., Jonassen & Kwon, 2001; Li & Ranieri, 2013; Machin et al., 2007; Subrahmanyam et al., 2001). Since educational and labor market outcomes in adulthood are largely pre-determined by the academic performances in childhood (Heckman et al., 2006), the potential influencing factors that affect student achievements have drawn a lot of interest from scholars. In addition to the digital divide mentioned above, other factors that were considered to be significant for student achievement, including family background (Avvisati et al., 2014, Zhao and Chen, 2022), school characteristics (Fan et al., 2020, Pop-Eleches and Urquiola, 2013), teacher characteristics (Chen and Zhao, 2022, Duflo et al., 2011, Gong et al., 2018), and socioeconomic conditions (Hannum and Meiyan, 2006, Malamud et al., 2019). In this paper, by regarding the Three Links Project (TLP) implemented in China as a quasi-natural experiment, we are aimed to identify the causal effect of ICT in education on student achievements in rural China.====Our study falls into the broad research field involving the impact of ICT in education on students. Some scholars found the advantages of ICT in education. Higher Internet self-efficacy, which is associated with better academic achievements and more cognitive capacities, is present among students who use the Internet at school (Bai et al., 2016, Li and Ranieri, 2013, Zhao and Xu, 2010). Moreover, ICT in education may foster student enthusiasm, boost classroom interaction, and interest, as well as promote digital skills (Straker & Pollock, 2005; Pagani et al., 2016). More importantly, students’ horizons can be expanded by the Internet’s wealth of knowledge and information, which can help increase learning effectiveness (Jonassen & Kwon, 2001). The PISA recently showed that high-speed Internet access in schools is linked to greater results, even after completely accounting for socioeconomic background (OECD, 2020).====However, some studies considered the potential negative effects of the ICT and Internet use on students’ academic preforms, such as Internet addiction, reducing social interaction, lack of active participation in extracurricular activities, and decreasing classroom attention (Livingstone, 2012, McDool et al., 2020, Subrahmanyam et al., 2001). Besides, some scholars found that even an increase in information technology or applications for teaching did not help much in improving students’ performance (Angrist and Lavy, 2002, Rouse and Krueger, 2004). While there are a number of reasons for the heterogeneity of results, the findings are consistent for disadvantaged students. For example, Jackson et al. (2006) found that computer use significantly improved the reading achievements of students from low-income families in the US. Coincidentally, based on a sample of students from most remote school districts in Michigan, Hampton et al. (2021) drew a similar conclusion. In Chinese cases, Yang et al. (2013) indicated that using computers in school was good for improving academic performances of students from poor communities. Another evidence from rural China concluded that using ICT in the classroom helped pupils perform better in English (Bai et al., 2016).====Although the impact of ICT in education on student achievements has received some scholarly attention, there are few studies evaluating the effectiveness of China’s policies for ICT in education (Bai et al., 2016), especially causal effects and potential mechanisms. In fact, China has started putting the ICT in education construction initiative into practice since 2011.==== This project required that each class in rural China must have access to ICT resources and technology by the year 2015. More importantly, it was carried out in batches, which provides us with an available quasi-natural experiment to identify the causal effect of ICT in education on students’ achievement. In addition to the role of the authorities, we analyze potential mechanisms at the level of parents, teachers, and students. Thus, we seek to reveal how parents, educators, and authorities play a role in ICT in education to enhance student achievement and promote human capital accumulation.====In the following respects, we have some meaningful findings, which add to the body of literature already in existence. First, by using TLP implementation as a proxy for ICT in education in rural China, we adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) method to establish a causal link between ICT in education and students’ achievement. Our empirical results provide evidence that TLP implementations significantly improve students’ test scores, cognitive abilities, and non-cognitive abilities. This means that our findings support the positive outcomes of ICT in education (e.g., Li & Ranieri, 2013; Zhao & Xu, 2010; Straker & Pollock, 2005).====Second, we are also interested in potential mechanisms of ICT in education for student achievement. The results of mechanism analysis suggest that TLP implementations may work in three channels to enhance students’ achievement: parents, teachers, and students. Specifically, we find that TLP implementations can improve teachers’ efforts and enthusiasm, increase parental involvement in education, and bring positive student responses. Thus, based on the distinctive Chinese context, our research framework is well represented in how parents, educators, and authorities promote human capital accumulation through ICT in education.====Third, heterogeneity analysis results show that the TLP have greater positive effects on the achievement of some disadvantaged students. With the advancement of ICT in education, China’s education inequality and urban-rural digital divide may be alleviated. Taken together, our study complements the role of ICT in education on the human capital accumulation of disadvantaged students (Bai et al., 2016, Hampton et al., 2021), and expands the body of knowledge on reducing educational inequality (Agasisti et al., 2021, Asadullah et al., 2020, Hannum and Meiyan, 2006, Li and Ranieri, 2013, Machin et al., 2007). Also, this study may have implications for other developing countries to formulate relevant ICT in education public policies.","ICT in education can improve students’ achievements in rural China: The role of parents, educators and authorities",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893823000224,7 March 2023,2023,Research Article,11.0

Our results suggest education exerts a positive influence, and its marginal impact is more prominent for females than males. Further, we show that better childhood health is associated with increased likelihood of ageing well. We also demonstrate an inverse relationship between health care utilisation and healthy ageing. The results presented here suggest that strategic policy investments across life courses in education and child-health fosters not only broader development goals but also enhances healthy ageing trajectories and improve the health and wellbeing of individuals across life stages. This study contributes to informing on the UN’s healthy ageing global strategic agenda in the context of a poor rural region.","Population ageing represents major policy challenges for all countries. As people live longer, the concomitant rise in age related chronic health conditions threatens to place an increasing strain on health care systems and associated societal resources. Globally, the number of people aged 60 years or over is projected to more than double from 1 billion in 2019–2.1 billion in 2050 (WHO, 2020a). Population ageing is taking place fastest in developing countries, where nearly 80% of the number of people aged 60 and older (1.7 billion) are expected to be living by 2050; with Africa experiencing the fastest increase. For policymakers, of particular importance in population ageing is ==== people age.====Recognising the global challenges population ageing represent, the WHO released a 10-year global plan of action, known as the ==== as a strategic framework to support older people to live longer and healthier lives (WHO, 2020a). The WHO framework aligns with the values and timing of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals with its focus on ending poverty and improving the lives of all people (Keating, 2022, World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a, World Health Organization (WHO), 2015). Central to the WHO’s agenda is the notion of healthy or successful ageing, which it defines as “…the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being into older age” (WHO, 2020a).====The WHO framework recognises the heterogeneity in the ageing process with many older persons retaining good health and maintaining high physical and social functional capabilities (Atella et al., 2021, Lowsky et al., 2014, Rowe and Kahn, 1987, Rowe and Kahn, 1997). Those people who experience healthy ageing may stay active longer in the labour force and can contribute to the productive output and fiscal capacity of the national economy (Marois & Aktas, 2021). The implications are that better ageing can enhance the quality of life for the elderly and may mitigate the future demands on societal resources. The degree to which policy can be designed to encourage healthy ageing depends on the understanding of its determinants and consequences.====In comparison to advanced economies, much less is known in developing countries regarding the economic and social implications of population ageing. The particular challenges healthy ageing poses in Africa has led the WHO regional committee for Africa to develop a framework for implementing priority actions for healthy ageing that more directly connects with the broader sustainable development goals (WHO, 2021). A core policy implication emanating is the need for strategic investment across the life-course to enhance the wellbeing of both older and younger people (Keating, 2022).====South Africa, the focus of this study, is expected to see the proportion of those aged 60 years or older to double from 7.7% in 2015 to 15.4% in 2050 (WHO, 2015). In poorer rural areas, the challenges of ageing populations are more pronounced given the relatively limited resources in health and related services. To date there has been very little research on healthy or successful ageing in South Africa and it is recognised that there is an urgent need for research to inform on policy development and planning to address the challenges posed by population ageing in that country (Pengpid and Peltzer, 2021, Solanki et al., 2019).====Our approach is motivated by a well-established framework conceptualising the notion of successful ageing originally provided by Rowe and Kahn who emphasise that individuals themselves can mitigate the decline in physiological and cognitive capabilities (Rowe and Kahn, 1987, Rowe and Kahn, 1997). Their framework consists of three intersecting key elements: low risk of disease and disease related disability; maintenance of high cognitive and physical function; and active engagement in life. A considerable body of related empirical literature has subsequently emerged. A number of studies have shown the importance of socio-economic individual level factors (i.e. education, income and occupation), health related lifestyle factors (smoking, drinking and physical activity), socio-cultural factors (i.e. community), and environmental and macro-level factors (i.e. pollution and access to health services) on ageing well (Marois and Aktas, 2021, Hank, 2011, McLaughlin et al., 2010, Chodzko-Zajko et al., 2008, Gaudreau et al., 2007, Depp and Jeste, 2006). More recent studies identify religious beliefs and spirituality, as well as childhood conditions and other early life circumstances as important origins of successful ageing (Malone and Dadswell, 2018, Tomás et al., 2015, Brandt et al., 2012).====Our study contributes to the literature on healthy ageing in several ways. First, we analyse the data at a more disaggregated level to gain insights on the components of ageing. Second, we investigate the possibility of gender disadvantage in successful ageing. Third, we link ageing outcomes and their determinants to health care utilisation. Each of these aspects directly informs on public policy supporting the WHO’s healthy ageing agenda.====The results reveal that factors positively associated with ageing well include higher education, socio-economic status, and healthy ‘lifestyle’ factors. We also find a positive effect of better childhood health status. For the aggregate measure of successful ageing, we do not find any differences between males and females, but the role of education is more pronounced for females. In terms of specific components of healthy ageing, we find that females have a relative disadvantage in attaining high cognitive and physical function. Further, the results suggest that health care utilisation is directly related to the degree of healthy ageing; those who age better use less health care resources. This has clear policy implications. Targeted programs aimed at improving the trajectory of ageing in a population not only yield better health outcomes for aged people, but also lower claims on health care resources.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 details the data and the construction of the outcome measurement used to define successful ageing. Section 3 presents results of various model specifications and examines the relationship between successful ageing and the propensity to utilise health care services. We conclude with a discussion of these results and their policy implications in Section 4.","The global healthy ageing agenda: The impact of education, gender, childhood conditions and social engagement in rural South Africa",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893823000273,28 March 2023,2023,Research Article,12.0

Both advanced countries and emerging and developing economies have been affected by this trend. In a seminal paper, Rey (2013) identifies the presence of a global financial cycle exerting an influence on all countries regardless of their exchange rate regime. While this last point is debatable (see for example Obstfeld et al., 2019), the existence of the global financial cycle has subsequently been largely confirmed in the literature (see the literature survey by Miranda-Agrippinoa & Rey, 2022). In addition, it has been argued that the global financial cycle is determined to a large extent by monetary policy in the United States (Miranda-Agrippino & Rey, 2015). In line with the literature devoted to the influence of American monetary policy on the global financial cycle, a certain number of studies have analyzed the effects of spillback on the American economy. This work suggests that spillback effects are significant and tend to magnify the domestic effects of US monetary policy (Dées and Galesi, 2021, Breitenlechner et al., 2022).====Our paper is part of the previous literature insofar as we investigate the respective effects of financial shocks from the United States and the Euro area. Crucially, however, we diverge from this literature on three main points. First, while the previous literature assesses the impact of external influences on the US economy via feedback effects, we analyze the responses of US financial variables to financial shocks from the Euro area. To this end, we estimate Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) model to assess the international propagation of positive credit shocks, share price shocks, and house price shocks by considering three regions: the United States, the Euro area (subdivided in three groups) and some North European countries over the 1995Q1–2016Q4 period. VAR approach has been introduced by Pesaran et al. (2004). Such model allows to account for trade and financial interdependencies between countries—which is a key condition to correctly analyze international shocks transmission.====Second, our GVAR model rests on the financial accelerator mechanism (Bernanke et al., 1999) in which changes in borrowers’ balance sheets exert an influence on their access to finance. For instance, higher house prices can ease household credit constraints as the value of collateral increases. In turn, this lesser credit constraint tends to favor the acquisition of real estate which leads to a further increase in house prices and thereby to rising collateral and so on. In other words, the financial accelerator mechanism highlights how economic and financial shocks are magnified leading to a procyclical finance (for a critical review, see Fontana & Passarella, 2020).====Thirdly, in line with the seminal article by Strange (1970), but also drawing on the work of Gilpin (1975) and Keohane and Nye (1977), we combine economic analysis and international relations. More specifically, our econometric investigation seeks to assess the possible presence of asymmetries between the United States and the Euro area, asymmetries which, from our point of view, have implications in terms of the balance of power. In other words, our investigation falls within the perspective of international political economy understood as the marriage of two disciplines to use the expression of Gilpin (1975). Such an approach is relatively little used in economic journals where questions of international economics are addressed.====We find that the international propagation of financial shocks is largely explained by the United States including within the Euro area regions. This result implies reforms within the Euro area promoting an increase in its autonomy vis-à-vis the American financial and monetary system.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

A new concept labeled HELD Curve, not addressed in the literature so far, is proposed to model the inverse non-linear relation between loss of economic activity and death rates during the Covid 19 Pandemic in Europe, due to the lockdown policy. ==== estimation supports this view offering to policymakers a tool to assess the impact of continuing the lockdown. The HELD curve elasticity implies a trade-off of 218 thousand EURO per saved human life.","Before the development of the Covid 19 pandemic, it was obvious that mortality rate due to diseases and fluctuations of the rate of economic activity were uncorrelated phenomena. At the outburst of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, an undisputed political consensus emerged worldwide, acting to limit and restrict the normal course of economic activity and individual mobility in order to contain the contagion of the pandemic disease. A new pervasive policy emerged, the so-called lockdown policy, which affected the entire social and economic life.====I postulate that the human-economic loss dilemma (HELD) poses a trade-off between saving lives and saving economic activities during the emergency period of Covid 19 pandemic. When the lockdown restrictions impeding the normal economic activity are high relative to normal levels, we expect the rate of deaths to be lower. Conversely, when the lockdown is weak, and the death rates are higher than normal we expect the economic activity to rise. It seems plausible that this principle should operate as one of the factors determining the rate of change of deaths during the Covid 19 pandemic is the stringency of the lockdown policy measures.====When the lockdown policy stringency is high and there are fewer human workers around, we should expect firms to have higher difficulties to maintain the production level, suffering a higher damage. This suggests a linear inverse relation between death rates and economic loss. On the other hand, it appears that when the lockdown policy is relaxed, the contagion continues, and the death rates fall only very slowly while the economic activity can be resumed quickly. This suggests that the relation between death rates and economic activity could, therefore, likely to be non-linear.====In analogy with the Phillips curve (====I will label “HELD curve” the short run relation between economic loss (the reduction of economic activity) and human life loss (the mortality rate associated with the Covid pandemic) and I will label “Non-Accelerating Loss of Economic Activity Mortality rate”, “NALEM”, the point at which expectations and changes in the productive organization of firms (i.e. smart working) are incorporated in the short run HELD curve, so that the economic activity is adjusted to the zero level at a constant loss level of human deaths. It is the point that renders useless the lockdown policy in the long run, because the economy accommodates on the vertical long run curve, which is the level of mortality rate associated with zero, or non-increasing, economic loss. It is similar to the concept of Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) (set forth by ====; see also ====).====The purpose of the present study is to see whether statistical evidence supports the hypothesis of the HELD curve, i.e., that the rate of change of economic activity due to lockdown measures can be explained by the level of excess of mortality rates with respect to normal and if so to form some quantitative estimate of the relation between the mortality rates and the economic losses, due to the effect of the lockdown policy. An indirect encouragement to deepen the research along the lines of this work is found in ====. However, note that this issue has not been analyzed in the literature so far. ====, Aum et al.

ECB, 2021a, ECB, 2021b). In 1999, the primary goal of the ECB was fixed in terms of price stability. The quantitative definition of this stability, given by an inflation rate of “below 2%,” became the ECB’s target. The 2003 strategy review changed the target to “below but close to 2%.” According to the new revision of the ECB’s strategy performed in 2021, 2% has become the reference point; therefore, the medium-term inflation rate should neither exceed nor remain below this symmetric threshold.====This paper aims to examine the principal strength and weaknesses of the ECB’s new quantitative target in the pandemic and post-pandemic frameworks and to discuss how the revised strategy is likely to shape policy going forward, considering the side effects and interaction with the ECB’s secondary goals (e.g., financial stability, growth, and employment). Our approach offers a fresh assessment of the effectiveness of the ECB’s recent decisions in dismissing non-conventional instruments and increasing policy interest rates. In the current phase of the business cycle, characterized by high inflation rates and a growing stagnation risk in the euro area (EA), a revision of the monetary policy strategy is crucial for explaining the ECB’s recent decisions and forecasting the possible evolution of the monetary policy.====It is well known that the unexpected persistence of the supply bottlenecks due to the pandemic shock and the consequent break-ups in the international value chains triggered an inflation process and ‘real’ disequilibria in the European Union (EU) and – specifically – in the EA in the second half of 2021. At the end of February 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine worsened the European quantity and price constraints on the supply side, putting inflation rates out of control and increasing the risk of an economic recession. In this situation, the monetary policy in the EA has gradually assumed a restrictive stance. In March and June 2022, the ECB ended public and private net asset purchases based on the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and the Asset Purchase Programme (APP). Then, according to the so-called appropriate sequence,==== the ECB started to increase policy interest rates in July 2022, reaching a policy reference rate of 2.5%, at the end of 2022, through two increases of 50 bps and two of 75 bps. Finally, in the October 2022 meeting (with the related implementation of November 23rd), the ECB started a quantity tightening by increasing the interest rates on the Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations TLTRO III refinancing contracts in place and by offering banks the possibility of early repayment dates. Furthermore, in the last meeting of December 2022, the ECB announced a severe reduction (roughly 50% of the average full replacement starting in March 2023) in the reinvestment of principal payments from the APP portfolio.====The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the price stability goal and the central bank’s inflation target from a general perspective; then, it specifies the process leading to the ECB’s strategy review. Section 3 compares the ECB’s and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) parallel choices in implementing the new strategies. 4 The economics behind the review strategy: the fall in the natural interest rate, 5 New inflation target and inflation buffer discuss the theoretical and empirical rationale behind revising the ECB’s inflation target. Section 6 places the strategy review in the EA’s current monetary policy context; it focuses on the interplay between the new strategy and the policy for relaunching the eurozone economy (2023–26) under the current stagflation risk.

This analysis provides a critical picture of the influence of remittances on school dropouts in Bangladesh by giving us a significant positive outcome of the remittances as a whole on education. With the increase in remittance inflows in Bangladesh, the risk of children aged 6-18 dropping out of education are more likely to fall. Aside from the positive impact, this study suggests that government should take the initiative of reducing the costs of sending remittances to Bangladesh. Moreover, the government should provide procedural and structural support to migrants.","Policies that reduce the number of children that drop out of school are critical for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4). There has been a significant increase in children starting primary school than ever; dropout rates remain significantly higher and low completion of primary and secondary school countries (Sabates et al., 2010). In Bangladesh, the school dropout rate has been alarming, driven by poor socioeconomic status. The question that motivates this study is, “====?”.====Migration and remittances are two themes that have received much attention among policymakers and researchers in recent years. Generally, remittances are regarded as monetary or non-monetary payments made by migrants to friends and family in their places of origin, which are predominantly sent to underdeveloped nations (Cooray, 2012). Globally, South Asia is the largest region in the world to receive remittances (World Bank, 2022). South Asia contains 29% of people living below the extreme poverty line worldwide. India (175.7 million people living in extreme poverty), Bangladesh (24.4 million people living in extreme poverty), and Pakistan (9.9 million people living in extreme poverty) are some of the poorest countries in South Asia; however, many countries in south Asia have recently been able to combat poverty and remove a significant portion of their populations from the extreme poverty line (SARMD, 2019). The remittance inflow to these South Asian countries has also been increasing, notably in Bangladesh. Remittance flows to Bangladesh increased from US$ 1.9 billion in 2000 to US$ 21.7 billion in 2020 (Cooray, 2012, Islam, 2021).====There is a well-established connection between remittance and socioeconomic development. Extant literature has shown that remittance significantly enhances economic growth and human development (Acheampong et al., 2021, Annen et al., 2016, Khraiche and Boudreau, 2020, Imai et al., 2014a, Imai et al., 2014b). Specifically, the existing empirical studies have focused primarily on the role of remittances and migration in eradicating poverty and promoting income equity (Acosta et al., 2007, Adams Jr and Page, 2005, Adams et al., 2008, Córdova, 2006, Imai et al., 2014a, Imai et al., 2014b, Taylor, 1992). In addition to poverty eradication and income equity, migration and remittances have been shown to have a substantial effect on children’s educational outcomes (Acosta et al., 2007, Amuedo-Dorantes et al., 2010, Calero et al., 2009; Edwards & Ureta, 2003; Hanson & Woodruff, 2003; McKenzie & Rapoport, 2011). In Bangladesh, there is extensive research on the impact of remittances on poverty, income inequality, and economic growth (De Bruyn & Kuddus, 2005; Murshid et al., 2000; Siddiqui & Abrar, 2003; Siddiqui, 2001; Uddin & Sjö, 2013). However, none of these studies have investigated the contribution of remittance on school dropout in Bangladesh.====Against this backdrop, this research investigates the effect of remittances on school dropouts in Bangladesh. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no literature has ever attempted to observe the impact of remittances on school dropouts in Bangladesh using survival analysis. We, therefore, contribute to the literature on remittances and economic development literature by unraveling the impact of remittance on school dropouts in Bangladesh using a robust econometric technique. In this study, we use two most recent datasets from the Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) to help understand the implication of remittance for school dropouts at the microeconomic scale. From a methodological perspective, this study deploys the Instrumental Variable Cox Proportional Hazard model to address a number of econometric issues, such as sources of endogeneity and self-selection. This study also differentiated internal remittances’ contribution to school dropout from international remittances. Finally, the findings from this study will inform policymakers in their attempt to address school dropout to achieve SDG 4 in Bangladesh.====The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a literature overview of past empirical investigations, Section 3 describes the data and technique, Section 4 analyses the empirical findings, while Section 5 provides the conclusion with some policy-oriented recommendations.",Do remittances reduce school dropout in Bangladesh?

The low ==== environment in Israel since the beginning of the last decade has also contributed to the rise in demand for housing, which exceeded the available supply and led to a continuous rise in the price of housing. The various government programs all attempted to halt the rising prices, with no long-term success, if any. Policymakers focused on making ownership of housing affordable for young couples but directed their activity at repressing the demand for housing among investors and housing upgraders. This interpretive article focuses on analyzing Israel’s housing policy and indicates the built-in failure engrained in this policy, as the demand for housing in Israel is a rigid demand deriving from the country’s demographics and values and therefore attempts at repressing it are futile in essence. The housing policy aimed at making housing affordable for young people must examine, before it is finalized, their overall incentives to own housing on one hand and the obstacles they encounter that prevent them from opting for rentals on the other, and accordingly formulate the features and different terms of the policy. The research conclusion indicates the need to implement a public policy that will promote the rental alternative as an efficient way of meeting the demand for housing on one hand and of curbing the price of housing on the other.","The considerable rise in housing prices in Israel since 2008, after the stagnation (and even realistic drop) in their prices in the early 2000s, placed the concern of a real estate bubble in the Israeli economy on the public agenda. A historical perspective shows the considerable contribution of real estate bubbled in various economies to the evolvement of financial and social domestic crises. Volatile real estate prices are not unusual and can be found in any וןthere are two particularly conspicuous cases of extreme volatility in domestic real estate prices known to have led to a long-term acute economic crisis within the country and even outside it. The first was in Japan in the early 1990s (the house price bubble crisis) and it has been extensively studied (Weinstein, 2001, Ito and Iwaisako, 1995, Stone and Ziemba, 1993, Noguchi, 1994, Cargill et al., 1996, Schaede, 1996, Ohmi, 2010). The second is the real estate crisis in the US in the late 2000s (the subprime crisis) that has also been the focus of much research (Kregel, 2008, Demyanyk and Van Hemert, 2011, Gjerstad and Smith, 2009, Blundell-Wignall and Atkinson, 2008, Gwinner and Sanders, 2008, Hellwig, 2009, Whalen, 2008, Arner, 2009, Brown and Davis, 2008, Sagemann and Reese, 2011). The financially destructive outcomes of these crises were a warning signs of what might happen in Israel in the event of a real estate bubble development. These concerns encouraged the Israeli public policy makers to design and to promote various policy steps to curb the rise in apartment prices (Cohen, 2016, 2021).====Indeed, previous studies evidence on the possible negative macroeconomic effects of intervening in the housing market in order to reduce the rising apartment prices: like a drop in private consumption, an increase in unemployment and entry into economic recession (Gustafsson, Stockhammar, & Österholm, 2016). Yet, many countries take action and implemented a public policy to reduce the apartment prices in their local market.====The research literature offers several possible intervention methods available to leaderships. First of all, by implementing a monetary policy that curbs the demand for mortgages, for instance by raising interest rates (Getahun, 2011; La Cava, 2016) or by Implementation of regulatory limits on mortgage (Cronin and McQuinn, 2016, McQuinn et al., 2021). Second, by utilizing fiscal policy tools to reduce the demand for housing, for instance by imposing transaction taxes, property taxes, and mortgage interest tax deductibility (Alpanda & Zubairy, 2016). Third, by operating macro-prudential regulation aimed at moderating the demand for housing and reducing the risks for the financial system, for instance by higher capital requirements of mortgage applicants and limits on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios (Bordo and Jeanne, 2002, Crowe et al., 2013). And fourth, Policy makers can take action to influence the supply and to increase the number of apartments in the domestic market, with the aim of lowering the point of equilibrium between supply and demand (Karantonis and Janet Ge, 2007, Gurran and Phibbs, 2013).====The global economic crisis in 2008–2009 led to implementation of an expansive monetary policy in various countries around the world, including Israel, manifested in reduced interest rates in the Israeli economy, which in turn helped increase the demand for residential housing and raise prices. However at the same time natural demographic processes occurred in Israel, manifested in population growth, As detailed below:====Israel is considered a country with a more prominent population increase than other developed countries (Schellekens and Anson, 2017, Weinreb, 2020). The increase in Israel’s population stems from a combination of three main factors: First, the high rate of Jewish immigration from other countries to Israel, usually for ideological and Zionist reasons (Eckstein & Weiss, 2004). Second, the rise in life expectancy resulting (among other things) from the advancement and improvement of healthcare services (Dwolatzky et al., 2017). Third, relatively high marriage, childbirth, and fertility rates for religious, cultural, and traditional reasons (Szajnbrum, 2009, Okun, 2013, Okun, 2017, Weinreb et al., 2018). The increase in Israel’s population, which began with the founding of the state, has continued consistently in recent years as well (Fig. 1).====Concurrent with the increase in Israel’s population, residents are also inclined to concentrate in the center of the country (DellaPergola, 2004), As can be learned from the following figure. Central Israel (which includes the central, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem districts) now includes more than half Israel’s residents, while the rest are spread among the close periphery (Haifa district) and the distant periphery (the northern and southern districts), which contributed to the increase in the natural demand for housing and rise in housing prices in Israel in general and in the central regions of the state in particular (Cohen, 2018) (Fig. 2).====From 2009 to 2015, public policy designers in Israel formulated a long list of steps for stalling and even reducing housing prices. These steps can be classified as belonging to three categories: steps for decreasing the demand for housing, steps for increasing the supply of housing, and steps for actual reducing of housing prices (Cohen, 2016). The policy steps taken proved, however, to no avail and housing prices continued to climb. After the 2015 elections and once the new government was established, elected Minister of Finance Moshe Kachlon established a committee to take action to reduce housing prices in Israel. As a result of this committee, a decision was reached in August 2015 to expand the government’s ""Price for Residents"" program, which facilitates discounts for young couples according to certain criteria.====This program acted to market state-owned land to real estate developers at a subsidized price, predicated on selling the apartments constructed at a significant discount. As a result, many developers avoided involvement in projects included in the program. At the same time, the government reduced the marketing of land not included in the program, with a consequent drop in the number of construction starts during 2017–2018. This program was strongly criticized by economists, real estate firms, and media personnel, who claimed that not only was it not efficient, with many distortions and faults (low chances of winning a slot, poor finish grade of the apartments, location in outlying and less attractive areas, delays in construction processes, and more) but also capable only of stalling prices in the domestic property industry and not of reducing housing prices. Moreover, this program also causes real damage to the real estate industry as it artificially and temporarily restrains the demand for housing on the free market, which also affected the level of supply and the number of construction starts (Cohen, 2021).====The various public policy steps in this area in general and the “Price for Residents” program in particular have not achieved their declared goal of generating a lengthy halt in the rise of housing prices in Israel. Aside from the temporary drop in Israel’s housing index in 2018 (resulting from the “Price for Residents” program), this index has continued to rise over the past decade. Therefore, policymakers in Israel must realize that it is not possible to reduce housing prices in a market regulated by the supply and demand forces operating in a free market characteristic of the local real estate industry. Past, present, and future regulatory steps aimed at repressing the demand for housing by all those involved (those who do not own a home, home improvers, and investors) will not achieve the declared goal of reducing the price of housing in the long term and for a lengthy period in circumstances that offer no housing alternatives.====Indeed, regulatory steps that endeavor to increase the supply of housing can certainly lead to a halt in price increases or even to a drop for a certain period, until the consistent and rigid demand for housing in the Israeli market will catch up with the pace of the rising demand and lead once again to a rise in the price of housing. However, so long as citizens have no satisfactory alternative for housing aside from owning a home, they will continue to purchase homes at any price, in the constant concern that the present price (high as it may be) is lower than that anticipated in the future and therefore, lacking any other reasonable housing option, they will be motivated to purchase homes and thus increase the demand.====In order to change this pattern of conduct, policymakers must produce an acceptable and reasonable alternative for housing before acting to artificially suppress the demand. This resembles the current state on Israel’s roads with their increasing congestion (Cohen, 2019). In that case as well, policymakers must promote an alternative to enable transport mobility (by developing efficient, fast, and accessible public transportation) before acting to restrain the demand for use of private vehicles (by means of congestion fees, restricting access to private vehicles in favor of public transportation lanes, and others). People will probably not relinquish their private vehicles despite the high financial cost of their maintenance and the traffic congestion, so long as they do not identify a reasonable and readily available alternative that will allow them to travel comfortably, quickly, and efficiently from place to place without needing private vehicles.====Similar to the private vehicle market, in the housing market as well – so long as people do not identify the rental option as one that is relevant for their needs, they will continue to endeavor to obtain ownership. However, unlike the field of transportation, where creating an effective alternative to owning a private vehicle could take many years, in the real estate market it is possible to create an alternative to home ownership in a relatively short span of time. The rental market can be presented as an alternative to owning a home, acting to promote a legislative process that will regulate this market in a way that will meet the various needs of lessees and form a preferred option, as in some other countries (shown below). The various legislative processes that will regulate the rights of lessees on one hand and the obligations of house owners on the other will facilitate long-term (geographical and budgetary) stability and certainty for lessees and thus affect their motivation to purchase a home of their own and create a preference for the rental alternative. At the same time, unlike steps taken to date, policymakers must refrain from implementing policy that limits and represses the activity of investors in the housing market) (Weiner & Fuerst, 2017), as these have the effect of increasing the supply of housing in the rental market.",The unregulated private rental sector and the impact on Israeli housing market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016189382300008X,10 February 2023,2023,Research Article,17.0

Reducing dirty energy usage requires an effective transition toward clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Effective governance and ==== are needed to hasten the transition toward clean fuels and technologies for cooking. However, not much is known empirically about the role of access to credit and governance in the transition towards clean cooking technologies, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study, therefore, utilizes the two-step-dynamic system generalized method of moment estimator to investigate the effect of access to credit and governance on the adoption of clean cooking technologies in SSA. The findings indicate that access to credit and governance variables do not facilitate clean cooking technologies usage. The conditional analysis also reveals that the governance variables moderate the effect of access to credit to impede the adoption of clean fuels and technologies for cooking. The findings indicate that economic growth, education, and rural population drive the adoption of clean cooking technologies. Sensitivity checks show that the effect of access to credit and governance on clean fuels and cooking technologies usage differs among income and regional groups within SSA. We, therefore, argue that better financial and governance systems are required to hasten the transition toward clean fuels and technologies for cooking in SSA.","This study investigates the role of access to credit and governance in the transition towards clean fuels and technologies for cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Sustainable development goal 7 (SDG 7) requires countries to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Despite attempts to provide access to modern and clean energy, most of the world’s population still relies on traditional polluting fuels and technologies for cooking. The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, hereafter ESMAP (2020) report suggests that approximately 2.8 million people still rely on traditional environmentally unfriendly fuels and cooking technologies. The overreliance on conventional polluting fuels and technologies for cooking poses severe economic, health, and environmental problems. For instance, available data shows that cooking with traditional polluting fuels and technologies has resulted in approximately four (4) million deaths due to indoor pollution==== and has further costs the global economy more than 2.4 trillion dollars per annum. Again, the health cost and the cost to women using dirty cooking fuels and technologies are estimated to be $1.4 trillion and $0.8 trillion, respectively (ESMAP, 2020).====The severe economic, health, and environmental cost associated with using traditional polluting fuels and technologies calls for policymakers to prioritize policies and strategies for quickening the transition towards adopting clean fuels and cooking technologies. While policymakers have been keen on promoting the adoption of clean cooking technologies (Bono & Giacomarra, 2016), the current progress report on SDG 7 has slackened (ESMAP, 2020). For instance, approximately four (4) billion people worldwide still lack access to clean, efficient, convenient, safe, reliable, and affordable cooking energy (ESMAP, 2020). As shown in Fig. 1, regional analysis suggests that access to clean cooking technologies and fuels differs among geographical regions. From Fig. 1, North America has made significant progress in achieving universal access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, with 100 % of the population having access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Also, in Europe & Central Asia and, the Middle East & North Africa, over 90 % of its population has access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Latin America & the Caribbean and East Asia & Pacific have also made significant progress, with more than 80 % of Latin America & Caribbean and 60 % of the East Asia & Pacific population having access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Evidence, as presented in Fig. 1, shows that South Asia and SSA countries have less access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking; however, South Asia has significantly improved, with approximately 50 % of its population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.====Despite significant progress in increasing access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking in other regions, SSA progress has been abysmal. As displayed in Fig. 1, less than 20 % of the SSA population has access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. In other words, SSA is off track in achieving universal access to modern and clean cooking fuels and technologies by 2030. Recently, policymakers and researchers have attributed the slow adoption of clean fuels and technologies for cooking in SSA to rural-urban divides, poor-infrastructure facilities, high monetary costs, lack of awareness of the benefits of using clean cooking fuels and technologies, and cultural barriers (Ekouevi, 2013, Schlag and Zuzarte, 2008). While these identified factors are critical, we argue that fundamental factors such as governance and credit accessibility should be given the uttermost attention since some of these already identified barriers can be overcome with good governance and financial systems. Therefore, to improve the adoption of modern and clean cooking technologies in SSA, it calls for policymakers to prioritize governance and credit accessibility in the design and implementation of national energy policies that intend to promote universal access to modern and clean cooking fuels and technologies by 2030.====Effective governance systems can promote the development and adoption of clean fuels and technologies for cooking by shaping energy policies. Effective governance can create a vision for the energy sector and provide the enabling environment needed to develop a market for clean cooking technologies. In other words, the effectiveness of energy policies for hastening the transition towards clean fuel and technologies for cooking depends on governance. Therefore, weak governance systems can render energy policies ineffective and impede the development and use of clean cooking fuels and technologies and vice versa. Also, a sound governance system can quicken the transition towards clean cooking fuels and technologies by eliminating or reducing coordination failure. The slow development and usage of clean fuels and technologies for cooking could be attributed to poor coordination around the common strategic approach for developing clean cookstoves and fuel markets (Cookstove, 2011). Therefore, a governance system that promotes effective coordination among actors such as governments, cooking technologies manufacturers, consumers, and non-governmental organizations would provide opportunities to achieve the economies of scale associated with producing clean cooking technologies (Cookstove, 2011). Also, a governance system that enforces the rule of law and further ensures the protection of individual property rights can lead to the development and adoption of clean cooking technologies. Boosting the development of clean cooking technologies through enforcement of contracts can result in massive production and supply of clean cooking technologies, driving the price of these technologies downwards.====Also, a developed financial system that easily provides access to credit to households and clean cooking technologies manufacturers is vital for a successful transition towards clean cooking fuel and technologies. Cookstove (2011) indicated that households having access to credit through microfinancing could enable households an opportunity to overcome the higher initial upfront cost of clean fuels and technologies and thus improve households’ usage of clean cooking technologies. Credit accessibility can further improve the adoption of clean cooking technologies by enhancing a household’s income. The provision of credit to households could enable them to create microenterprises, reduce poverty and increase capital accumulation, thereby improving their incomes (Twumasi, Jiang, Ameyaw, Danquah, & Acheampong, 2020). Improving households’ income through access to credit could enable patronizing clean cooking technologies. In addition, clean cooking technologies manufacturers and distributors having access to credit could allow them to expand investment and production of clean technologies for cooking. Expanding investment and production of clean technologies for cooking could reduce the price of these technologies, thereby increasing household demand and usage (Cookstove, 2011). Similarly, a developed financial system could easily mobilize and channel household savings through credit to the new commercial entrants to the clean cooking technologies market, which can significantly facilitate their ability to expand the production and supply of clean cooking technologies.====From the discussion, it is indisputable that governance and access to credit play a significant role in the adoption of clean cooking technologies. The existing literature has deployed household survey data to examine the determinants such as household income, product price, household wealth, education, and cultural factors on the adoption of clean cooking technologies (See, for instance, Beyene & Koch, 2013; Gould, Urpelainen, & Hopkins Sais, 2020; Guta, 2020; Nuño Martínez, Mäusezahl, & Hartinger, 2020; Twumasi et al., 2020). However, not much is known empirically about the contributions of governance and access to credit in adopting clean cooking technologies in SSA at the macro-level.====Therefore, this study examines the effect of access to credit and governance on adopting clean cooking fuels and technologies in SSA. Using SSA for this study will contribute significantly to literature and policy discussions on accelerating the adoption of clean cooking technologies in the continent. This is because it is the region with the least access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking and has a weak financial system globally (Acheampong, 2019, Ibrahim and Alagidede, 2018). Mlachila, Jidoud, Newiak, Radzewicz-Bak, and Takebe (2016) show that despite improvement in financial development in SSA, both financial markets and financial institutions are less developed than in other developing regions. These authors indicated that credit to private sectors as a ratio of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in SSA has risen by approximately 10 % points since 1995, to about 21 % in 2014; however, it remains only about half the size of that in the Middle East and North Africa, East Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. SSA also has a weak governance system characterized by corruption, political instability, poor accountability and regulation, and the rule of law (Acheampong et al., 2021, Gossel, 2018). From a policy perspective, SSA is at the forefront of implementing the Sustainable Energy for All (SEE4ALL) goal; however, the status of its financial and governance systems raises a critical question about their role in achieving the SEE4ALL goal. Therefore, the critical question of policy concern is, “====” To answer this broad question, this study seeks to address the following specific research questions.====In answering the research question, this paper contributes to knowledge and policy in the following ways: From a policy perspective, understanding the impact of access to credit and governance on the adoption of clean cooking technologies in SSA is essential to support any policy decision to accelerate the adoption of modern and clean cooking technologies in the region. For instance, The African Energy Commission has developed the Africa Energy Transition Program to enhance access to affordable clean energy for productive uses and households in Africa. This program is driven by Africa Union Agenda 2063, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and Paris Agreement on climate change. Therefore, the outcome of this study will inform and support the policies and strategies for achieving the energy transition goal in the region. Besides, earlier studies have examined the contribution of the institutional environment in achieving energy efficiency (See, for instance, Acheampong et al., 2021; Amuakwa-Mensah, Klege, Adom, Amoah, & Hagan, 2018). Our study augments the existing body of knowledge by providing new empirical evidence on the contribution of fundamental variables such as access to credit and governance to the transition towards clean fuels and cooking technologies in SSA, which has not received much empirical attention in the existing literature. Additionally, our study contributes to knowledge by examining how governance conditions the effect of access to credit on the adoption of clean fuels and cooking technologies and further explores how the difference in governance and financial development among regions and income groups affect the accessibility to clean fuels and cooking technologies.","Governance, credit access and clean cooking technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for energy transition",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893823000029,3 January 2023,2023,Research Article,18.0

In 2021, a plan to pay approximately $900 per year to each citizen was proposed by one of the country’s presidential candidates. The outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020 fueled discussion about basic income. Due to the pandemic, economic activity was greatly reduced, and many people found it difficult to maintain a basic livelihood. In response, the Korean government paid several emergency disaster subsidies. Similar to a basic income, the first emergency disaster subsidy was paid to the entire nation.====The basic income system solves the problems with the existing welfare system, which must first select its targets and then monitor them to prevent illegal demand. The basic income system solves these problems because it pays the same income to all citizens.====Nevertheless, the basic income system requires huge financial resources that are difficult to procure. In 2021, for both political and economic reasons, the presidential candidate referenced above suggested financing the basic income system through a land-holding tax. Politically, the Korean people were expected to be relatively unlikely to criticize a land-holding tax. The previous government raised the housing holding tax too high, causing numerous complaints. According to the National Tax Service of Korea, the comprehensive housing holding tax increased by approximately 11 times from 2017 to 2021, resulting in the highest housing holding tax ever. The political prediction of scant popular resistance to a land-holding tax was also based on the fact that most land-holding taxpayers are corporations, not individuals. According to the National Tax Service of Korea, as of 2021, approximately 82% of the comprehensive real-estate holding taxes for land were paid by corporations. Economically, the land-holding tax is efficient because, unlike capital and labor income taxes, it does not distort the tax base (Kalkuhl et al., 2018, Schwerhoff et al., 2022). Some opponents of the basic income system argue that it pays money to people who do not work, thereby reducing their motivation to supply labor. Below, we discuss existing studies of the basic income system.====Moutos and Scarth (2003) theoretically analyze the macroeconomic effects of the introduction of the basic income system in both a closed economy and an open economy. In the former case, because capital is given exogenously, the introduction of the basic income system does not affect the macroeconomy. In the latter case, capital is free to move abroad and is endogenously determined. Under such circumstances, if a capital income tax is levied to finance the basic income system, the price of capital rises. Firms reduce wages to offset the increased cost of capital. Under low wages, productivity is low, leading to a decrease in the gross domestic product (GDP).====Van der Linden (2004) investigates how the basic income system affects participation in the labor market using the dynamic general equilibrium model, which determines wages through labor-management negotiations. He considers the case of providing basic income only to those who participate in the labor market and the case of providing a basic income to everyone regardless of whether they participate in the labor market. In the former case, the labor market participation rate increases when a basic income is introduced. In the latter case, the labor market participation rate may decrease when a basic income is introduced because excessive taxation is required to provide a basic income to everyone regardless of whether they participate in the labor market.====Fabre et al. (2014) compare the welfare effects of a basic income system and the unemployment benefit system in the United States using the dynamic general equilibrium model. They find that unemployment benefit schemes are superior to basic income schemes because unemployment schemes can be more specific about who needs them than basic income schemes. They also show that the introduction of the basic income system increases the unemployment rate.====Nikiforos et al. (2017) examine the macroeconomic effects of the introduction of a basic income system in the United States using a Keynesian-type Levy macroeconomic model. They introduce methods to finance the basic income system through government debt and taxation. They show that using government debt to pay every adult $1000 a month increases GDP by 12.56% after eight years and that using taxes to fund the program increases GDP by 2.62%. The reason for the first finding is that the economy grows when basic income is paid to households due to an increase in aggregate demand. The reason for the second finding is that the propensity to consume is greater in the low-income class (which pays less tax) than in the high-income class (which pays more tax), thus stimulating the economy.====Using the cases of Indonesia and Peru, Hanna and Olken (2018) show that in developing countries, selective transfer income is more effective than basic income. In developing countries, transfer income is provided by selecting recipients based on their income. However, it is difficult for the government to observe the income of a significant proportion of the population. Thus, the rich are often included among the beneficiaries of selective payments or those who must receive them are excluded. Nevertheless, selective payment is more effective than basic income because it can transfer more income to the poor on a per-person basis than basic income can.====Luduvice (2019) derives the macroeconomic effects of the introduction of the basic income system in the United States using the dynamic general equilibrium model. He considers ways to use existing welfare funds and taxation to obtain the financial resources required for a basic income system. In the former case, GDP increases by 5.2% because the inefficiency caused by the qualifications for the existing welfare system disappears. In the latter case, GDP decreases by 13.1% because increased taxes are required to obtain the financial resources required for the basic income system.====Magnani and Piccoli (2020) examine the effects of the introduction of the basic income system coupled with a flat income tax on the French economy using a micro-macro simulation model. They consider the way to use existing welfare funds to obtain the financial resources required for the basic income system. They show that introducing a basic income system with a flat income tax not only significantly reduces income inequality and poverty but also has moderately positive macroeconomic effects. The reason for this finding is the very low elasticity of labor supply to net real wages and other non-labor incomes in France. Furthermore, because existing welfare funds replace the financial resources required for the basic income system, additional funds are not required.====Caamal-Olvera et al. (2022) simulate four scenarios for Mexico involving direct money transfers equal to $1668 per month to individuals in multidimensional poverty, elderly people, families with children under 15 years old, and all populations, using the MEXMOD tax-benefit microsimulation. The best policy in terms of its distributive impacts is the unconditional transfer (basic income) policy. However, that scenario is also the most expensive and would cost 10.61% of GDP.====We extend the literature in several ways. First, previous studies do not address the issue of whether household members decide to sell the land endowed to them due to a sharp increase in the land-holding tax rate to raise funds for the payment of basic income. In contrast, this study reflects this decision endogenously. If basic income—which requires huge financial resources—is provided through a land-holding tax, household members who cannot afford the tax will sell their land. It is reasonable to reflect this phenomenon in the model. Second, other studies do not systematically address the relationship between holding assets and reservation wages in their analysis of basic income. In contrast, our study introduces this relationship to solve the problem of determining whether household members supply their labor when receiving basic income. Third, other studies do not explicitly consider housing, land, and mortgage loans when analyzing basic income. Therefore, our study designs a more realistic model by reflecting these factors.====For the reasons set forth above, our objective is to systematically examine the type of economic ripple effect that would occur if a scheme to pay a basic income of approximately $900 per year to each citizen through a land-holding tax, as recently discussed in Korean political circles, were introduced. Simulation results obtained using data for Korea show that the introduction of such a scheme would have negative macroeconomic effects because the land-holding tax rate would need to be significantly raised to obtain the financial resources to pay the basic income. Such an increase in the land-holding tax rate would increase the number of landowners selling land due to an inability to withstand the rapid increase in the land-holding tax rate. This reduction in the number of landowners would lead to increased land-rental prices because of the decrease in the land-rental supply. This increased cost of renting land would lead to a decrease in the land demand of producing firms, resulting in a decrease in such firms’ production and social welfare.====Interestingly, contrary to the arguments offered by opponents of the basic income system, we find that under such a system, the number of household members who want to supply labor increases. The reason for this finding is the decrease in net assets that follow a sharp increase in the land-holding tax rate.====The remainder of the study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the main features of the model that serves as the theoretical framework for the study. Section 3 provides the simulation results. Section 4 presents the conclusions.",The macroeconomic effects of basic income funded by a land-holding tax in Korea,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893823000078,3 February 2023,2023,Research Article,19.0

The emphasis is placed on answering the questions about the causal linkages between who funds and performs the research and the research outcomes. A lack of change in use of the GBHs in agriculture stems directly from public (Government) support of the position how the GBHs are safe for humans and the environment. The results of our meta-analysis clearly demonstrate how large and growing majority of influential research on the subject suggests otherwise. Early research on the subject, prior to 2010, done by private and public sector researchers was strongly indicating how GBHs are safe for humans, animals and the environment. It is possible that there is inertia in food safety policy leading to this large gap and disconnect between the results of hundreds of more recent studies and the (current) course of public policy. This study helps us better understand why science on this subject has not been conclusive and thus not the main driver of “science-based” policies about the GBH based production of genetically modified foods. The importance and the implications of this research are obvious: Evidence-based decisions and policies informed by rigorous research and unimpeded by other interested parties are necessary when it comes to developing public policy that affects food safety and in turn human and animal health, and the environment.","Global adoption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is a contentious issue due to a lack of conclusive scientific evidence about the consequences of GMO food production and consumption on humans, animals and the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines GMOs as those organisms in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally (WHO, 2022). In general terms, the safety assessment of GM foods should investigate: a) toxicity, b) allergenicity, c) specific components thought to have nutritional or toxic properties, d) stability of the inserted gene, e) nutritional effects associated with genetic modification, and f) any unintended effects which could result from the gene insertion (Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations-FAO, 2022). Accordingly, the GM products that are currently on the international market have all passed risk assessments conducted by national authorities. However, some of the recent studies sound alarm about the direct impacts of the GM foods on human and animal health, and the environment.====Special concern and emphasis are placed on the use of pesticide glyphosate, facilitated by developing GM varieties of crops such as soybeans or corn that are resistant to the use of glyphosate. Swanson et al. (2014) underscore these concerns: “A huge increase in the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases has been reported in the United States (US) over the last 20 years. Similar increases have been seen globally. The herbicide glyphosate was introduced in 1974 and its use is accelerating with the advent of herbicide-tolerant genetically engineered (GE) crops. Evidence is mounting that glyphosate interferes with many metabolic processes in plants and animals and glyphosate residues have been detected in both. Glyphosate disrupts the endocrine system and the balance of gut bacteria, it damages DNA and is a driver of mutations that lead to cancer.” Such evidence is very explicitly emphasized in some of the recent studies. US Department of Agriculture (USDA) data document dramatic increases in the use of glyphosate-based herbicides and GM soybeans is a major driver for this development (Benbrook, 2012, Benbrook, 2016). US GM soybeans thus represent a system that is influenced by glyphosate exposure and should be an ideal system in which to test whether crop management practices that include spraying with glyphosate might lead to accumulation of chemical residues, or other compositional differences, in the final soy product. Residue analysis is of particular interest, since there are no programs in the EU, US or Canada designed to monitor the main herbicides used in transgenic crop production. One of the most influential experimental studies to this effect on GM soybeans by Bøhn et al. (2014) uncovers that glyphosate tolerant GM soybeans contain high residues of glyphosate and rejects that, “…GM soy is “substantially equivalent” to non-GM soybeans.” (Bøhn et al., 2014, p. 207).====In response to the findings of most recent scientific studies (e.g., Guyton et al., 2015), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 2015) concluded that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic to humans.” As that announcement, a group of prominent scientists from the USA, Canada and the UK (Myers et al., 2016) have produced a Statement of Concern drawing on emerging science relevant to the safety of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs). Their Statement of Concern considers current published literature describing GBH uses, mechanisms of action, toxicity in laboratory animals, and epidemiological studies. It also examines the derivation of current human safety standards. They conclude that: (1) GBHs are the most heavily applied herbicide in the world and usage continues to rise; (2) Worldwide, GBHs often contaminate drinking water sources, precipitation, and air, especially in agricultural regions; (3) The half-life of glyphosate in water and soil is longer than previously recognized; (4) Glyphosate and its metabolites are widely present in the global soybean supply; (5) Human exposures to GBHs are rising; (6) Glyphosate is now authoritatively classified as a probable human carcinogen; (7) Regulatory estimates of tolerable daily intakes for glyphosate in the United States and European Union are based on outdated science.====Concerns that global population and income growth may drive food demand beyond what can be supplied sustainably have intensified (e.g., Suweis, Joel, Maritan, Rinaldo, & D’Odorico, 2015). While improved food production technology, such as GM varieties of herbicide resistant crops, is often touted as a solution to the food security problems, there is growing concern about the environmental and health consequences of such technologies (e.g., Myers et al., 2016). Notably, there are solutions such as reducing post-harvest loss and food waste as alternative pathways to meeting rising food demand using existing environmentally sustainable systems (e.g., FAO, 2019; Miljkovic & Winter-Nelson, 2021). There is a need to properly examine food technologies through rigorous scientific research that will advise on their safe adoption and use by public policy. However, the outcomes of scientific research in this area are often ambiguous thus failing to provide clear guidance for best policy actions.====The objective of this research is to determine the factors that influence the outcomes of previous scientific research on the potential adverse effects of GBH on human and animal health and the environment. The emphasis is placed on answering the questions about the causal linkages between who funds and performs the research and the research outcomes. The study will help us better understand why science on this subject has not been conclusive and has not been able to be the main driver of “science-based” policies about the GBH based production of GMO foods.

Democracy in isolation is useless for the poor in SSA.,"At the beginning of this millennium, world leaders met at the United Nations Millennium Summit to undertake the momentous task of eradicating poverty in its various forms. The outcome of this summit was the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which set the development agenda through 2015. Replacing the MDGs, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have as their primary goal the end of poverty in all its forms everywhere in the world by 2030. In particular, the goal of halving the poverty rate that prevailed in 1990 was achieved six years ahead of the deadline that had been set by the Millennium Development Goals. Since 1990, the proportion of the world’s population living below the international poverty line has been reduced from 35.9 % to 10 %, a reduction of more than 70 % (World Bank, 2018).====However, between 1990 and 2015, the regional distribution of poverty clearly changed. In 2015, more than half of the poor lived in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 85 % lived in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.====The number of people living in extreme poverty outside of sub-Saharan Africa fell from 708 million in 2010–240 million in 2021, while in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people living in extreme poverty significantly increased between 1990 and 2002 and has remained almost level since then (World Bank, 2022). In 2010, 416 million people in countries in sub-Saharan Africa were living below the extreme poverty line – this was 37 % of the global population living in extreme poverty. By 2021, the region is still home to more than 457 million people living in extreme poverty. As poverty has reduced elsewhere around the world, extreme poverty in countries in sub-Saharan Africa now represents a global share of over 66 % of the people who live in extreme poverty around the world. It therefore becomes important to understand why Africa’s poverty rate is not only higher than most other low- and middle-income countries, but also why its reduction is slower.====It is with this in mind that this research attempts to explain poverty in sub-Saharan Africa through the prism of democracy. Indeed, among the findings of the World Bank, the poor have weak ties to the state. They have limited access to public goods (infrastructure) and quality services, and their voice counts for little in public policymaking (Calderon et al., 2019). Many studies claim to show that democracies are more successful than non-democracies in improving the welfare of the poor (Sen, 1981, Sen, 1999, Moon and Dixon, 1985, Dasgupta, 1993, Lake and Baum, 2001, Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003). These claims are consistent with mainstream political economy models, which suggest that democracies produce more public goods and more income redistribution than non-democracies (Meltzer and Richard, 1981, McGuire and Olson, 1996, Niskanen, 1997, Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003). But it is not clear that democracy actually reaches the poor by producing better social outcomes. This is because democratic institutions are generally slow to respond to external shocks, and for politicians seeking re-election as the deadline approaches, they may engage in suboptimal short-term policies. In addition, the expansion of civil liberties may lead to increased conflict over income distribution. From this point of view, we should observe a negative impact of democracy on the process of wealth production and redistribution. This negative impact can thus cancel out the positive effect of democracy on poverty reduction.====The objective of this paper is to examine the effect of democracy on poverty reduction using a sample limited to sub-Saharan African countries. Our contribution is empirical, mainly due to the relevance of the SSA context. Indeed, as mentioned above, SSA is the poorest region in the world, despite significant progress in terms of democracy. However, a key feature of the democratization of SSA is that democratic progress has been unevenly distributed across it, with clusters of regimes emerging in certain sub-regions: West Africa and Southern Africa have been the most democratic sub-regions; progress in East Africa has known ups and downs, while Central Africa continues to be dominated by autocratic regimes (Freedom House, 2018). If the studies present contradictory results on the effect of democracy on poverty, it is above all because of the differences in samples, periods and estimation techniques, including the indicators of poverty and democracy. In addition to the direct effect of democracy on poverty reduction, we examine potential transmission channels such as economic development and human capital. In this paper, we use two indicators of democracy (electoral democracy and institutionalized democracy) and two indicators of poverty (poverty index and depth of poverty). Then we employ the System Generalized Method-of-Moment (GMM), which we apply on a sample of 40 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 1999–2018. This technique allows us to correct for endogeneity problems and to account for unobservable and time-invariant country-specific effects. The use of this approach was possible thanks to an interpolation technique that fills in missing observations on the poverty variables. Finally, we check the robustness of our results by assessing their sensitivity to the interpolation, the sample and the specification of the model.====Our results show that democracy is not directly associated with poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, this observation hides important non-linearities and an interesting pattern of policy complementarities. Indeed, democracy is associated with poverty reduction in countries with high economic growth and high human capital. The robustness tests conducted do not alter these results.====In what follows, we briefly discuss the literature on the effect of democracy on poverty. In Section 3, we present the methodology and data. Section 4 presents and discusses the results, and Section 5 concludes with the policy implications of the study.",Is democracy pro poor in Sub-Saharan Africa?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016189382300011X,14 February 2023,2023,Research Article,21.0

In this study, we propose an outline for economic readiness in case of a future crisis in general, and a pandemic outbreak in particular. Through the establishment of a dedicated income-based tax-financed budget aimed at funding government excess expenditure during a crisis, and by adopting a reserve program in the essential sector of the economy, social and economic costs can be reduced.","The rapid spread of the Coronavirus has shaken the global economic systems, causing the sharpest decline in global economic activity since the collapse of the South Sea Bubble in 1720 (McKibbin & Vines, 2020). As a result, governments’ ability to address the crisis has been at the center of public discourse, with the understanding that continued and flexible fiscal support is required to deal effectively with the crisis outcomes, until a durable recovery is underway (International Monetary Fund, 2021).====However, as the epidemiological-economic crisis continued, the implementation of multiyear fiscal support actions to health care systems, firms, and households, along with the sharp fall in tax revenues caused by contractions in output, were reflected in an unprecedented rise in the deficit and debt levels of governments around the world, resulting in significant updates in debt projections as compared to pre-pandemic estimations (Salvatore, 2021). The average overall deficits in 2020, as a percentage of GDP, reached 10.5 % for advanced economies, 9.3 % for emerging market economies, and 5.1 % for low-income developing countries. Moreover, the worldwide average public debt in 2020 reached a historically high level of 99 % of GDP and is projected to stabilize at around 94 % in 2022 (IMF, 2022).====Nevertheless, the country’s ability to provide support to its citizens is correlated with its ranking by per capita income level. The rise in deficits in advanced economies and some emerging market economies was caused by roughly equal increase in spending and declines in revenues, whereas in most low-income developing countries and emerging market economies, the rise in government deficit stemmed primarily from the decline in revenues due to the contractions in output. In a context of historically low interest rates, countries with stronger buffers and better access to finance were able to deploy larger fiscal support. Moreover, as of 2021, many governments in advanced economies are implementing sizable spending and revenue measures, with an average of 6 % out of GDP, while support provided in emerging market economies and low-income developing countries has been much smaller, where a large share of these measures is close to expiring (IMF, 2021).====McKibbin and Vines (2020) argued that to allow many of the emerging market economies to undertake the kind of massive fiscal response that advanced countries have been able to carry out, there is a need for international cooperation which involves financial assistance in the amount of $2 trillion. Adam et al. (2020) discussed the required overseas development assistance (ODA) to help countries in sub-Saharan Africa deal with the fiscal and medical issues caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. The authors showed that keeping the degree of domestic fiscal adjustment within reasonable bounds requires an $50 billion of ODA, which doubles the aid these countries receive. Support from the international community to low-income countries that face especially daunting challenges has been also suggested by the IMF. According to the IMF calculations, $3 trillion is needed for 121 emerging market economies and low-income developing countries to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, i.e., 2.6 % of 2030 world GDP (IMF, 2021).====Pre-existing inequalities have amplified the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the crisis has aggravated those inequalities, even among EU countries. Carnazza and Liberati (2021) found that countries of the Eurozone that before the COVID-19 crisis were in a state of high debt-to-GDP experienced a significant increase in interest rates and a greater perceived risk of default. According to the IMF, “a vicious cycle of inequality could morph into a social and political seismic crack”. To reduce that risk, the IMF calls for tackling these inequalities, which, in many cases, require substantial increases in tax capacity and improvements in the efficiency of public spending. Policy responses should include increasing the progressively of income taxes, inheritance and gift taxes, and property taxation in advanced economies, while emerging market and developing economies should focus on strengthening tax capacity to finance more social spending. Coronavirus recovery contributions and wealth taxes were also suggested (IMF, 2021).====Essential staff shortage and job burnout is a primary challenge to implementing surge capacity plans during a pandemic (Casafont et al., 2021, Jalili et al., 2021, Hick et al., 2020). Workers in essential industries hold occupations ranging from physicians to grocery clerks, and during an outbreak they face varying virus exposure risks depending on their occupation and job tasks. Clearly, individuals involved in healthcare and first responders encounter diseases and infections daily and typically are at increased risk of exposure to high viral load because of their close contact with COVID-19 patients, which puts them at risk of becoming infected as has been the case during many previous epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Ebola. Moreover, Firew et al. (2020) show that healthcare workers have experienced significant physical and psychological risk while working during the Coronavirus pandemic.====Indeed COVID-19 has sickened many essential workers, with a growing number of health care workers who are infected or quarantined after exposure to the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a far-reaching negative impact on healthcare systems worldwide and has placed healthcare providers under immense physiological and psychological pressures (Ardebili et al., 2021). However, workers in non-essential professions may find themselves unemployed in emergencies, especially when a general curfew and restrictions on movement are imposed on the public. According to the International Labour Organization, the decline in working hours stood in 2020 at 8.8 % relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. These working-hour losses are equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs and nearly four times greater than during the global financial crisis in 2009.====The uncertainty surrounding the outbreak dynamics and its economic effects has exposed the government institutions’ unpreparedness for integrated epidemiological-economic crises (Pratiwi and Salamah, 2020, Bruinen de Bruin et al., 2020) and the lack of understanding regarding the unique dynamics between the spread of the disease and the economic loss resulting from measures taken to curb it (Lazebnik and Alexi, 2022, Lazebnik et al., 2021a, Lazebnik et al., 2021b). Thus, we need to ensure that in similar situations in the future, governments can respond proactively rather than reactively, to instill a better degree of confidence in the financial and economic systems.====This study attempts to outline an economic preparedness path for a future crisis. The proposed outline is similar to the Israeli Army reserve program. In reserve duty, residents who have completed military service are assigned to the Israel Defence Forces’ military reserve force to provide reinforcements during emergencies (war, military operations, or natural disasters) and as a routine course (e.g., for training and other activities). Israeli reservists usually devote five to six years of their life to military service. All types of reserve units are called up at least once a year for a period of twenty-one to thirty-six days for soldiers and forty-two days for officers. From a comparative perspective, the Israeli model well corresponds to the Swiss one while much less to the North American models. Notwithstanding the different characteristics, in most countries, the reserve forces are heavily utilized in emergencies (Perliger, 2011).====In Israel, the National Insurance Institute (NII) pays a reserve service benefit to any person who is called up for reserve duty under the Security Service Law, as well as to anyone called up for training under the Emergency Labor Service Law.==== In our model, the reserve service program is funded by a dedicated budget aimed at covering government excess expenditure during a crisis.====Crisis management is not new in economics, especially in the finance field, and it has been emphasized even more since the 2008 financial crisis. The OECD work on financial sector guarantees has intensified since the 2008 global financial crisis as most policy responses for achieving and maintaining financial stability have consisted of providing new or extended guarantees for the liabilities of financial institutions. As part of that work, the Symposium on “Financial crisis management and the use of government guarantees” was held in Paris in October 2011, and focused on bank failure resolution and crisis management, in particular, the use of guarantees. However, While the use of guarantees was a central theme, the Symposium also analysed other aspects of the design of safety nets. The traditional three-tier safety net, consisting of a lender of last resort, bank deposit insurance, and a (micro-prudential) regulator-supervisor was considered incomplete, which led to calls for the creation of additional functions, including: (1) An institutionalized tiered systemic crisis insurance function, inspired by mechanisms developed for funding resolution of natural or man-made catastrophes.

This hesitation again characterized the decision-making process regarding the purchase of vaccines. The attempt to get a reasonable price for the purchase of vaccines resulted in a rollout in implementing the vaccination campaign in many countries, including the European Union which was on a tight budget==== (Crescenzi et al., 2021). The establishment of the emergency budget can help policymakers pay unemployment benefits to workers who have lost their jobs, help businesses in crisis, and purchase the required vaccines and equipment, thereby providing the policymakers with leeway to deal with the emergency with ease, without being disturbed by its financial implications.

These findings provide additional insights into the role of women in government - women across the board in government will not necessarily lead to a “cleaner” government, and that, the institution of quotas to bolster women’s participation in the political process is not advisable, at least when corruption reduction is a goal.","With women’s suffrage coming of age in most nations, along with globalization, aided by rapid technologies of information dissemination, there has been an increased focus on gender equality around the world. In fact, gender equality is one of the sustainable development goals outlined by the United Nations (====), and emphasized by other international organizations (====; ====). The efforts towards this equality have encompassed economic, social, and political spheres, although significant differences, rooted often in culture and religion, remain across nations.==== Thus, the task of policymakers to facilitate/institutionalize equality across genders remains unfinished.====Within these broad considerations and recognition of gender inequality, gender differences in politics and the need for better representation of women in government have been widely recognized and promoted. Globally, the United Nations Population Fund, has identified women empowerment as an important issue (Issue 7), and section 4.4 states that “Countries should act to empower women and should take steps to eliminate inequalities between men and women as soon as possible.”==== Among other things, they call for “[e]stablishing mechanisms for women's equal participation and equitable representation at all levels of the political process and public life in each community and society and enabling women to articulate their concerns and needs.”==== Furthermore, the United Nations’ sustainable development goal 5.5, target 5.5, states that, “5.5 Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life”.==== In the United States, Women in Government (====) is an organization that seeks to empower and facilitate women state legislators across different states.====One strategy that more nations have turned to increase women’s representation in the legislative process is gender quotas.==== A quota system generally comes in one of three forms: (1). reserved seats in the legislature, (2). legal candidate quotas, and (3). voluntary political party quotas. For each of these systems, women must comprise a specified percentage of the group subject to the quota, with the goal that they achieve at least a “critical minority”, typically in the range of 30–40 %.==== Responsibility to achieve the quota rests on those who are charged with the recruitment process. At the time of this writing, over 50 % of all countries globally have adopted some form of quota system in parliamentary elections. How well quota systems work in achieving intended objectives is unclear as problems of their implementation have been noted in at least some countries.====All this points to the importance of devoting attention to gender equality in politics and government, and this paper provides a formal analysis with respect to the impact on corruption. A part of the reason for women’s relatively lower representation in the government might be rooted in history (e.g., when they were allowed to vote in their respective nations). We account for this in our analysis below.====Academics from different social science disciplines have tried to inform the gender empowerment debate, with initial investigations aimed at how to facilitate gender equality.==== Over time, the focus has also shifted to the effects of the empowerment of women along various dimensions (Cuberes and Teignier, 2014, Duflo, 2012), and it is to this aspect that the present research is directed. Specifically, this paper examines the effects of the political empowerment of women, particularly, greater participation of women in the government, and compares their relative influences in the legislative versus executive branches on cross-national corruption in a large sample of nations. The corruption-gender angle cannot be claimed as a new angle, with Swamy et al. (2001) being an early and well-cited formal empirical investigation. However, along with an updated dataset consisting of a large sample of nations, we add a number of novel dimensions of the nexus between female empowerment and political corruption. First, the legislative-executive branch comparison, and the consideration of the role of enforcement are key contributions to the extant literature that make the related analysis more realistic, better grounded in intuition/theory, and thus better able to inform related policy. For instance, the legislative versus executive branch distinction in this context can address petty versus grand corruption, with legislatures better equipped to institutionalize grand corruption by writing/passing nations’ laws. To the extent legislative bodies differ across nations, for example, across parliamentary and presidential systems of government, our research will also address the broader question of whether the type of electoral system matters in the gender and corruption context.====Further, the role of the government is crucial, with its role as the generator of rents on the one hand, and an enforcer of laws on the other hand, (Rose-Ackerman, 1999). Moreover, government officials can be involved in both petty and grand corruption.====Beyond the participation in legislative/executive branches, there could also be differences across government officials depending upon whether they are elected or appointed. Elected officials are more directly answerable to the public, and one would expect this accountability to act as a corruption deterrent (although there could be fraud/corruption in elections (Goel and Mazhar, 2015)). On the other hand, political/government appointments can often ignore meritocracy and due process, and be subject to graft and nepotism. While these distinctions are present across gender, the willingness to participate in corrupt acts (seek and impart undue favors) might differ across gender (Goel and Nelson, 2021c).====Beyond these issues, we also explore possible connections between gender quota systems and corruption. While quota systems might lead to greater participation of women in the legislature (and thereby indirectly deter corruption), the record of such systems in that regard is inconclusive based on the extant literature. Further, the implementation and operationalization of such quotas may also be associated with nepotism and graft, and thereby contribute to the incidence of corruption.====To summarize, three key questions addressed in the present research are the following:====A comparison of the effectiveness of gender composition of the branches of government is lacking in the literature. Thus, besides adding to the literature, the findings would be instructive for anti-corruption policy formulation. Further, the answer to the second question will inform whether corruption control policies should be uniform across nations (Billger & Goel, 2009).====Whereas a number of studies on gender and corruption have found that a greater share of females in the government to lead to lower corruption (e.g., Swamy et al., 2001), these findings are not supported across the board. Furthermore, the structure of the government in a nation might itself influence the prevalence of corruption (Goel & Nelson, 2021b). In our analysis, if it turns out that females serving in different roles within the branches of government do indeed have different impacts on corrupt activity, then anti-corruption policies can be tailored more specifically. A noteworthy finding would be if females in government are relatively more (less) effective at curbing grand corruption (as opposed to petty corruption). This finding would add not only to the gender-corruption literature, but to the overall literature on the determinants of corrupt activities.====The findings will also contribute to broader policies related to female empowerment. For now, the extant literature on gender and corruption lacks consensus regarding whether greater participation of women in government (executive and/or legislative branches of the government) necessarily reduces corruption in all instances.====To our knowledge, the exploration of any nexus between gender quota systems and corruption has not heretofore been explored in the literature. Our findings are best viewed as a preliminary effort to fill that gap as we only look at gender quota systems viewed wholistically and do not consider differences in the institutional details of these systems across nations. Nevertheless, our results will shed light as to whether possible corruption spillovers from such strategies to enhance women in the political process should be a matter of policy concern.====The structure of the rest of the paper includes motivation and the model in the next section, followed by data and estimation, results, and conclusions.",Women’s political empowerment: Influence of women in legislative versus executive branches in the fight against corruption,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893823000030,13 January 2023,2023,Research Article,23.0

We found there exist long-run relationships involving key ==== and population age shares. The findings indicate that Taiwan's aggregate production exhibits increasing returns to scale where the quality of labor input is the single most important source of growth. The out-of-sample forecast plots envisage that Taiwan's aging labor force does not necessarily decelerate real GDP growth for at least a decade or more. In particular, there are viable policy measures to curb labor shortages due to the shift in the age structure of the labor force caused by population aging.","Much like most industrial countries, Taiwan is aging. In 2018, one in seven of the economic powerhouse's population was 65 years and over, indicating it has become an aged society (Taiwan News, 2018). In fact, the long-term decline in total fertility==== and continuous improvement in longevity have accelerated the population aging process. Therefore, the proportion of Taiwanese population aged above 65 is expected to increase to one in five==== by 2025 (Lin, 2010). In itself, the progressive shift in the age structure (with the ratio of the old to the young exceeding one) could have extensive macroeconomic consequences in the long run, including, but not limited to, the size of the working population and real GDP. With the continued trend of the growing share of older workers in the labor force, the Taiwanese government has raised the workers' legal age of retirement to address the shrinking labor force.==== In addition, the industrialization process in Taiwan has transformed its production processes from low-skilled to high-skilled manufacturing (Chuang, 1999). So, confronted with a shrinking labor force associated with population aging, the Taiwanese government could engage in tax policies (such as tax holidays, accelerated depreciation, and tax credits for investment) to increase capital intensity in order to cope with the higher relative price of labor. To provide a conducive investment environment, local firms including small and medium enterprises should be given automatic access to bank credit at preferential rates.====Retrospectively, high saving and investment rates with a strong emphasis on attaining tertiary education are among the attributes of Taiwan's economic success. Government spending on education makes up a large share of the budget. In 2020, its total education spending was 928.4 billion New Taiwan dollars, an increase of 21% over the last decade.==== As a result, the percentage of its population above the age of 15 with high school, technical college and university degrees increased to 47.3% in 2020 from 37.05% a decade ago (see Fig. 1). As highlighted by Lee et al. (1994), the enhancement of the quality of labor input==== or human capital==== is the key driving force behind Taiwan's economic growth. Equipping the labor force of tomorrow with education and training could potentially bridge the future working-age population gap. Hence, educational policies on boosting human capital could mitigate the adverse macroeconomic effects of population aging.====Concomitantly, the fiscal burden on the government in the form of growing demand for social welfare and pensions is likely to increase in the foreseeable future, ceteris paribus, due to the rapid rise in the share of the elderly population.==== As a consequence, fiscal sustainability, in the long run, becomes questionable, especially since the government's direct tax revenue is anticipated to decline when aging reduces the size of the labor force and in turn active labor income. To meet the increasing government outlays for the expanding elderly population, the government would need to increase borrowing or taxation to finance the accrued social spending. An increase in government borrowing would crowd out domestic investment, which is seen to be detrimental to economic growth. Nevertheless, the extent of the effect of the demographic shift in impeding economic growth is unclear because it is contingent on the macroeconomic dynamics and the competitive forces at play. For example, if the younger cohort has more education than the older cohort (see Lutz et al., 2007), a highly educated labor force would be capable of achieving higher productivity, offsetting their diminished numbers brought on by prior low fertility rates.====The objective of this study is to examine empirically the long run relations among key macroeconomic variables and evolving demographic forces in Taiwan, and to understand their implications for future economic growth and to motivate policy decisions. The empirical model emphasizes the determinants of capital, physical labor, and human capital inputs in an aggregate production function, and how these factors are driven by the impact of demographic changes on saving and investment in the private and public sectors. Among the notable contributions of this study are (i) establishing the existence of long run equilibrium (cointegrating) relations between key macroeconomic variables and demographic factors; (ii) demonstrating the importance of Taiwan's investments in human capital and physical capital to cope with the declining share of working age population; (iii) long run projections of key macroeconomic variables, including real GDP, as driven by age shares of the population presented by the United Nations under their medium assumptions on the future path of fertility; (iv) while it is often said that demography is destiny, the evidence presented in this paper demonstrates that there are viable policy options for Taiwan to mitigate the adverse pressures of population aging.====This paper is organized as follows.

I measure bank efficiency across three periods – after Taiwan and China joined the ====, the global financial crisis, and the signing of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) – and show that Taiwanese banks were significantly more efficient than their Chinese counterparts. These results show that the ECFA platform has not improved bank efficiency and thus has failed to function effectively. This finding suggests that China and Taiwan should continue negotiating within the ECFA context to enhance cross-strait financial cooperation.","The World Trade Organization (WTO) imposes no restrictions on the operations of foreign financial institutions in the domestic financial markets of WTO member countries; therefore, foreign banks must be granted free entry and fair, competitive conditions. In addition, financial liberalisation and deregulation have been important topics over the past four decades, especially in terms of market entry, business opening-up, and bilateral supervisory mechanisms. Emerging Asian economies such as China and Taiwan have played important roles in global economic development over the past four decades. China and Taiwan opened their financial markets to foreign institutions when they joined the WTO in December 2001.==== This joint entry offers an interesting case to examine how deregulation and WTO accession affect the efficiency of domestic banks. Despite similarities in language, culture, and societal conventions, China and Taiwan are entirely different polities, with different financial supervisory systems and economic programs.====As a major development, Taiwan’s Straits Exchange Foundation and China’s Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits signed the Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in Chongqing on 29 June 2010. This agreement represents a step forward in cross-strait economic cooperation. Before the agreement, the cross-strait banking industry could not establish branches and subsidiaries, which makes it an interesting case for the effect of deregulation because the bilateral economic system and the degree of financial liberalisation have a significant gap. This study conducted a long-term analysis to provide empirical evidence on how deregulated cooperation – specifically, cooperation mechanisms, WTO accession, and the ECFA – has affected bank efficiency in a cross-strait economic zone. This study examines how deregulation after the WTO accession and the ECFA affected bank efficiency and whether (and why) these factors could have improved it.====This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, to the best of my knowledge, it performed the first long-run analysis examining how China and Taiwan’s WTO accession and ECFA, which occurred from 2005 to 2020, affected the efficiency of the banks (if at all) in the two countries, which have similar languages, cultures, and societal conventions but different patterns of economic growth. Second, by investigating whether marketability and profitability efficiency models are better than the traditional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model for evaluating bank performance, this study sheds light on how best to assess the market valuation and gauge the performance of a bank’s stock in terms of marketability efficiency. Therefore, following Seiford and Zhu (1999) and Luo (2003), the study used a two-stage production process in which profit is generated in the first stage and market value in the second. Third, scholars have focused their analyses on data relating to emerging Asian countries such as China and Taiwan amid the rapid growth and recovery in recent years, which has given them key global economic roles. The study enriches this research stream by providing additional empirical evidence on how the two-stage DEA model can be used to evaluate the efficiency of banks outside the United States and Europe.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the banking industries in China and Taiwan and reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents the methodology, data, and input and output variables used in the analysis. Section 4 reports my findings on the efficiency and productivity of banks in China and Taiwan. The final section presents the implications of these empirical results and provides suggestions for future research on the topic.","Deregulation, bank efficiency and economic cooperation across China–Taiwan Strait",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016189382200120X,30 December 2022,2022,Research Article,25.0

The objective of this paper is to examine the effects of the interventions, drawing on evidence from the ==== countries. A special feature here is the mechanism that underlies the impact of the containment policies. To this end, a causal mediation analysis decomposing the total effect into a direct and an indirect effect is conducted. The key finding is a dual cause-effect channel. On the one hand, there is a direct effect of the non-pharmaceutical interventions on the various health variables. Beyond this, a quantitatively dominant indirect impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions operating via voluntary changes in social distancing is shown.","To contain and mitigate the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), most countries have implemented a wide range of non-pharmaceutical health policy interventions. These interventions vary between countries and over time but include social distancing restrictions, bans of large gatherings, business closures, national border closures, partial or complete kindergarten and school closures, measures to isolate symptomatic individuals and their contacts, rules for wearing a mask, enhanced surveillance, comprehensive testing and advising the population to self-isolate voluntarily and preferably meet only the same people in ‘social bubbles.’==== Beyond these containment measures, governments have taken a multitude of fiscal and social safety net responses limiting the human and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.==== Understanding whether these interventions have had the desired effect of controlling the pandemic, and which interventions are successful in maintaining control, is critical given their large economic and social costs.====Countries vary in their capacity to surveil and enforce laws and regulations. Government interventions, entailing rigorous implementation of mobility restrictions throughout China, appeared to be effective in stemming the outbreak in Wuhan (====, ====). In countries where a similar level of enforcement may not be feasible, people must comply voluntarily with mobility restrictions for them to be effective (====). People may then choose not to comply because they perceive the risk of the pandemic or the benefits of mobility restrictions for themselves to be low. Of particular relevance in this context is the compliance with social distancing measures, in particular (not) meeting friends and acquaintances.==== On the other hand, agents respond to the health hazards and voluntarily change their behavior to less risky activities. One can also put it this way: de jure interventions are only part of the story; de facto compliance and voluntary social distancing matter as well. In the case of recurrent outbreaks, this distinction is particularly relevant, as this leads people to be less respectful of rules and less careful about their behavior.====The overall impact of the various measures to “flatten the curve” thus depends on two transmission channels. The first impact channel consists of the mobility changes evoked by the imposition of mitigation policies - the rigor element of governmental stringency measures - and voluntary social distancing - the fear element.==== The exclusive focus of impact assessments on ==== and ==== a policy measure works has been repeatedly criticized (====). Instead, there should be a stronger focus on the question of ==== a policy intervention works.

However, does trade with different trading partners have similar impacts on the economy? Trade statistics show that the proportion of Taiwan’s export went to mainland China and Hong Kong has risen from 24% in 2000 to 40% in 2006, and it has remained so until now. In contrast, Taiwan’s exports to the United States and Europe dropped from 38% in 2000 to approximately 20% in 2010 (Fig. 1). However, associated with the increasing size and frequency of interaction between Taiwan and China, Taiwan’s economic performance was weakening. The annual economic growth rate slowed from 6.23% during 1991–2000 to 3.61% during 2001–2015. Based on the calculation of this study, the mean growth rate of employment in a manufacturing cluster is found to be –1.57% per year over the period 2006–2011, when Taiwanese investment in China grew the fastest. Due to this phenomenon, one would wonder whether the significant changes in the structure of its export regions—the shift of major trade partners—would affect the economic performance of a small open economy. Through this study, we can infer the beneficial trade arrangements and policy directions for small economies.====On trade effect, the existing literature proposes two theoretical strands: economic geography and comparative advantage. From the new economic geography (NEG) perspective, trade between two economies will cause a home market effect, that is, industries with increasing returns tend to settle in the larger market and export to the other market, as first demonstrated by Krugman (1980) and then by Helpman and Krugman (1985). Such patterns of trade expansion can even lead to a core-periphery structure characterized by deindustrialization in the smaller economy resulting from labor movements following firm relocation (Krugman, 1991) or the mutual purchase of intermediate inputs among firms (Krugman & Venables, 1995). These arguments suggest that although trade benefits large economies, small economies may suffer. Conversely, the traditional comparative advantage (CA) view assumes a fixed amount of factor endowment in the form of immobile factors and claims that trade benefits both large and small countries.====So why do these differences in trade benefits exist? Fujita et al. (1999) argued that based on low to high factor mobility, trade practices can be categorized into three levels: international, interregional, and urban-rural. Different degrees of factor mobility correspond to different trade models. Davis and Weinstein (1999) used data from regions within Japan to obtain evidence supporting the existence of the economic geography effect. However, based on international data, Davis and Weinstein (1996) asserted that the economic geography effect is scant. Davis and Weinstein (1999) stated that the cause of this divergence is the greater mobility of factors across regions than across countries. The existing literature suggests that factor mobility is an important element when examining the impact of trade on a small economy.====To investigate our issue, this study, theoretically and empirically, compares the impact of trade with different trading partners. The theoretical model used in this study combines three mutually-trading economies: a small economy, a large economy, and the global market, wherein firms can move between the two economies (large and small). By contrast, no factor movement between the global market and either of the economies is assumed. Such simulations enable us to distinguish the differential effect of two trade scenarios—the small economy’s trade with the large economy versus its trade with the global market, namely, the trade involving high versus low factor mobility.====In the empirical analysis, Taiwan’s trading partners are divided into China and other countries, corresponding to the large economy and global market in the theoretical model, respectively. The similarity of language and geographical proximity of Taiwan to China have facilitated high mobility of firms and entrepreneurs between the two economies, and trade is likely to result in circular causality, as suggested by the core-periphery patterns of the NEG theory. However, the languages spoken in Taiwan and other regions outside China differ, leading to relatively low factor mobility, which could result in immovable comparative advantages in trade.====Although this policy-oriented study can supplement the existing body of empirical research on NEG, its strategy differs from previous literature as discussed in Section II. This study extends the empirical method of Acemoglu et al. (2016), who examined the impact of imports from China on employment in the United States. The method proposed by Acemoglu et al. (2016) is applied to investigate the differences in the economic impact of Taiwan’s exports to different trading partners and to verify the implications of the theoretical model—industrial growth driven by trade with the large economy is no more than that driven by trade with the global market for a small economy in the short run. This application, which considers exports as an independent variable and a small economy as the observation target, has the advantage of revealing the dynamic process of the NEG effect rather than the equilibrium consequences shown in previous literature. Thus, the current empirical setting can provide further insight into small-state trade policies. Moreover, the proposal and verification of short-run core-periphery effect are also the contributions of this study to NEG empirical literature. According to Redding (2010), many studies have exploited the changes in exogenous expenditure when testing the NEG effect. Therefore, to address possible endogeneity, this study introduces the two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach using the changes in industrial imports of various trading partners as instruments of Taiwan’s industrial exports.====This study focuses on the manufacturing clusters in Taiwan. By matching the trade data reported under Harmonized System Codes with the data coded with Taiwan’s Standard Industrial Classification, the study demonstrates that the impact of trade with different trading partners differs. Increasing exports to trading partners deemed to involve low factor mobility can drive employment growth, whereas exports involving high factor mobility do not.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces Taiwan’s major trade relationships and reviews relevant literature on NEG. Section III presents a conceptual framework for understanding the mechanisms of the distinguishable trade effects of the two trade categories.

Despite the growing literature analyzing the financial risks stemming from climate change, a better understanding of the transmission channels and the distributive effects across countries, sectors, and agents is still needed. We contribute to the flourishing literature on climate change and banking by proposing a novel methodology - based on firms’ energy cost - to assess the impact of the energy transition on Italian banks’ credit risk via the introduction of different carbon taxes on non-financial corporations (climate policy transition risk).==== Understanding its potential impacts is essential to inform the heated debate on implementing a carbon tax, the implication for financial stability, and the possible prudential tools to address climate risks for the financial system.====We build on the micro-founded climate stress test proposed by Faiella et al. (2022), which simulates the effects of alternative carbon taxes (€50, €100, €200, and €800 per ton of CO2) on Italian firms’ profits, the share of financially vulnerable firms and the debt held by them. The authors exploit firm-level administrative data to estimate the demand elasticity for different groups of firms, according to their sector. Then, they compute the price variations of each energy service (electricity, heating and transport) corresponding to the alternative taxes using the carbon emissions factors for each fuel. These variations are translated into sectoral policy shocks. Each group of firms indeed reacts to the price variations, according to its own energy mix and price sensitivity, changing the amount and the mix of the energy demanded. The new EBITDA, computed by taking into account the change in the simulated energy expenditure, is finally used as input into a micro-simulation model (De Socio & Michelangeli, 2017) to assess the financial vulnerability of Italian firms driven by the one-off introduction of a carbon tax. The authors estimate that the overall effect on financial vulnerability is small, but non negligible. With €50 carbon tax, the share of vulnerable firms and debt at risk would increase by about 45 and 11 per cent with respect to the baseline; the increase would be larger with a €200-€800 tax.====Leveraging on their results on firms’ vulnerability (our input), we estimate the potential impact of the different carbon taxes on Italian banks’ default rates at the sector level in the short term. First, we combine three sets of historical data on: i) Italian banks’ loan default rates at the sector level from the Italian Credit Register, ii) macroeconomic variables and iii) the share of financially vulnerable firms (and their debt) obtained from the micro-simulation model used to monitor financial stability at the Bank of Italy (De Socio & Michelangeli, 2017). We collect quarterly data from 2006 to 2019 for six sectors of economic activity (Manufacturing, Agriculture, Construction, Services, Real estate, Energy and Mining). Our empirical strategy is motivated by a strong positive correlation between the share of vulnerable firms (and their debt) and the default rates at the sector level, meaning that the former predicts well the latter in the short term and conveys additional information beyond macroeconomic and sectoral variables and autoregressive components. We thus select different sectoral models in which we predict the sectoral default rates as a function of the share of vulnerable firms (and debt). The models are selected according to their out-of-sample performance over a one-year horizon, using a standard forecasting exercise with rolling windows and direct forecast, where the target variable is the sectoral default rate. The evaluated models include autoregressive components, lags of the share of vulnerable firms (and debt), the real GDP (RGDP) growth rate and the sectoral value added growth rate. The selected models have a high predictive power over the short term. Finally, we assume that the Government implemented a carbon tax during 2018==== and estimate the counterfactual default rates in 2019 using the selected sectoral models and the simulated shares of financially vulnerable firms and debt provided by Faiella et al. (2022).====Results show that the credit risks for Italian banks stemming from introducing a carbon tax - during a favorable financial cycle phase characterized by historically low banks’ default rates - are modest in the short term. Assuming that the Government implemented a carbon tax of €50–200 during 2018, the quarterly default rates (for the sectors analysed) would increase in 2019 on average by 1.3 (or 1.4) times from 2.8 to 3.6 per cent, remaining, however, below their historical averages. The effect is heterogeneous across different sectors with agriculture and services being the most affected, consistently with the fact that these sectors’ energy demand is less elastic with respect to price changes and therefore suffer the most from the introduction of a carbon tax.==== The higher the value of the carbon tax, the higher the increase on default rates; still, even assuming a carbon tax of €800, the average quarterly default rate remains below the historical peak of about 9.5 per cent recorded in 2013.==== The results reflect the economic conditions, the financial position of Italian firms and the historically low default rates recorded in 2018, suggesting that the impact could be more severe if the tax were applied to years with higher baseline default rates or weaker firms’ financial conditions. Indeed, although the default rates remain low with a carbon tax between €50 and €200, the percentage change is not negligible, reaching high values for the most affected sectors (70 per cent for Services and 60 per cent for Agriculture). These results inform the discussion on the banking system’s risks during the transition to a low-carbon economy. Although the estimated transition risks are overall small, they are not negligible. The effect of an increase in the energy price on the probability of default is non-linear and highly heterogeneous across sectors. Further, risks arise from a few sectors, not necessarily those with the highest emission intensity. Banks, therefore, must commit to evaluating and managing the risks in their portfolios. At the same time, supervisors should discuss the appropriate micro and macro-prudential tools to address climate-related financial risks for the banking system (ESRB, 2022), taking into account these findings.====Our work contributes to the literature also by suggesting a novel methodology to estimate the effect of alternative carbon taxes on the banks’ credit risk that differs from the available macro-based climate stress tests in several dimensions and could be employed by other authorities.==== First, building on Faiella et al. (2022), we consider the impact of the shock on the firms’ cost structure, taking into account how their energy mix and demand adjust to energy price changes according to the estimated elasticity. The energy-demand channel represents a key novelty of our approach relative to the existing analyses that instead use firms’ greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) data - so-called scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions - as a proxy for the exposure to the transition risks.==== Second, we do not rely on GHG data provided by external data providers and bypass the associated data quality issues. Third, we focus on the partial equilibrium effects of the climate shock in the short term (1 year), avoiding the typical very long-term horizons and the related modelling challenges (Baudino & Svoronos, 2021). The last one represents both a strength and a limitation of our approach. On one side, the proposed methodology allows us to obtain relatively transparent and interpretable estimates of the effect of a climate policy shock on the banking system in the short term. On the other side, this short-term partial equilibrium exercise neglects the impact on the aggregate economy, banks’ reactions, and firms’ adjustments over a more extended period. Future extensions of this work may consider a longer-term perspective (i.e. 3 or 5 years) to overcome this issue or different phases of the financial cycle characterized by a weaker firms’ financial position and compute credit losses by applying the stressed default rates into a top-down stress test model.====Notably, the framework developed, which links the outcome of the microsimulation model proposed by De Socio and Michelangeli (2017) to the bank’s default rate at the sector level, could be employed for several additional analyses. First, it allows for studying any energy price shocks. Second, it could be used, for instance, to run a fully-fledged stress test using the NGFS scenarios (NGFS, 2021a, NGFS, 2020) or to study the effect of alternative exogenous shocks, such as Covid-19, regulatory or policy changes, and climate developments that may have heterogeneous impacts within and across sectors.====Finally, the methodology proposed can be adapted to the need of other European central banks or supervisors, which can access the Eurostat data to estimate the firms’ energy demand, as described by Faiella et al. (2022), firms’ balance sheets, and data on banks’ exposures and firms’ probability of default.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains why studying the potential effect of a carbon tax is relevant to inform policymaker decisions. Section 3 presents our theoretical framework and methodological contribution. Section 4 describes the data and the empirical analysis.

We find that the main role of taxation is to correct for the population-average internal costs of smoking, while anti-smoking campaigns serve a complementary role. Namely, they add to the social welfare benefits of tobacco regulation as they are relatively more effective than taxation at discouraging smoking by individuals characterized by low degrees of self-control and high smoke-related health","Many countries routinely implement policy interventions to regulate tobacco consumption. Historically, taxation has been the main instrument used by governments, initially just as a revenue-raising device, subsequently also as a mean to limit tobacco consumption.==== More recently, smoking prevention policies such as information-campaign programs about smoke-related diseases have gained importance in complementing taxation as tobacco control policies.==== The empirical evidence reported in Section 2 shows that anti-smoking campaigns play an important role in tobacco control, complementing that of taxation. However, while the theoretical underpinnings of tobacco taxation have a long history, those of prevention policies are still limited.==== The main purpose of this paper is to investigate how a non-price regulatory instrument adds to and interacts with taxation in the design of tobacco control policies.====We develop a framework in which a policy maker can use two types of regulatory instruments: (i) an ==== that discourages tobacco consumption by increasing its price, and (ii) ==== that affect consumption by inducing individuals to be more self-controlled when taking smoking decisions. We consider a population of consumers that are heterogeneous along several dimensions, such as the intensity of preferences for smoking, the size of future health harms caused by tobacco consumption, the degree of self-control in smoking, and the responsiveness to anti-smoking mass media campaigns. Our theoretical model of smoking behavior extends O’Donoghue and Rabin, 2005, O’Donoghue and Rabin, 2006 and Kőszegi (2005) — who examine the socially optimal level of taxation of a harmful good that is consumed by individuals lacking self-control — by explicitly considering the role of anti-smoking campaigns in regulating tobacco consumption.====Our normative analysis shows how anti-smoking mass media campaigns can usefully complement taxation in controlling tobacco consumption. Ideally, a set of individual-specific taxes would allow to implement the first best, hence making other instruments redundant. However, individual-specific taxes are unfeasible in practice, because of lack of information and high administrative costs. Therefore, policy makers rely on second-best uniform taxation, which in turn calls for the introduction of additional policy instruments targeting specific inefficiencies. Prevention programs are useful in mitigating these inefficiencies.====Second-best efficient taxation requires a tax rate equal to the population average marginal health costs that smokers fail to internalize into their consumption decisions because of lack of self-control. This benchmark rate needs then to be adjusted depending on the degree of heterogeneity in smokers’ responses to the tax induced price increase.==== Nonetheless, as taxation mainly addresses the average ‘internalities’, additional policy instruments can be useful to better account for consumers’ heterogeneity. In particular, the usage of anti-smoking campaigns determines more diversified responses than those implied by taxation for individuals with different internal costs of smoking. The ability to better account for agents’ heterogeneity implies social welfare gains that justify in themselves the introduction of anti-smoking campaigns.====The implications we derive in terms of the optimal structure of regulation policy are clear-cut. Whenever it is optimal to use both instruments, the second-best optimal tax rate — where taxation is joined by prevention programs to regulate tobacco consumption — is lower than the third-best optimal tax rate — where only taxation is used. Indeed, the non-price instrument crowds-out the price instrument.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on tobacco regulation and provides descriptive evidence on the relevance of taxation and prevention programs in tobacco control policies. Our theoretical model is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 defines individual and social welfare and examines the optimal structure of tobacco regulation policies. Section 5 calibrates the theoretical model to empirical data, leading to novel insights in terms of policy making.

Moreover, we examined the indirect effect of ==== and ==== through the channel of CO","“Why are certain nations more prosperous than others?” is one of the most fascinating and complex issues in economics. Several notable investigations have shown that the global divided of long-term economic growth may be explained by economic complexity ==== (Hausmann and Hidalgo, 2011, Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009, Hidalgo, 2021, Vu, 2020aaa). Accordingly, Complex economies that export and manufacture a wide variety of high-tech items, including autos, chemicals and electronics, seem to be more likely to see sustainable development (Felipe et al., 2012, Hidalgo, 2021). Contrarily, economies dependent on raw resources, lumber, and textiles are more likely to continue in prone to underdevelopment (Vu, 2020a). More particular, ==== offers a globally comparable measure of productive capacity depending on the set of goods inherent in a nation’s economic frameworks (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009). The fundamental assumption is that producing a wide range of goods with high and rising returns indicates the quantity of productive knowledge in an economy (Felipe et al., 2012, Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009, Hidalgo, 2021).====Recently research suggests that ==== matters for various economic consequences (Hidalgo, 2021). For instance, Lee and Vu (2020) and Hartmann et al. (2017) argue that ==== is connected with a reduction in income inequality. Numerous studies have shown a positive relationship between complexity and economic progress based on worldwide and sub-national statistics (Gao and Zhou, 2018, Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009, Zhu and Li, 2017). Other researchers contend that complex economies have superior health results (Vu, 2020b), increased employees’ share of income (Arif, 2021), and reduced per capita amounts of ==== emissions (Romero & Gramkow, 2021). Overall, the present research indicates that ==== is a major predictor of cross-country comparative progress. Therefore, the continuance of underdevelopment in many places of the globe may be alleviated by developing policies that consider the underlying reasons for worldwide disparities in complexity. This gives justification for looking into the elements that influence the emergence of ====.====Several empirical efforts have been made to determine the driving causes of ==== including, but not limited to, direct foreign investment (Kannen, 2020, Zhu and Fu, 2013), internet usage (Lapatinas, 2019), buildup of human capital (Hausmann et al., 2007), demographic characteristics (Vu, 2021) and property rights protection (Sweet & Eterovic Maggio, 2015). As a result of previous research, there has been a strong association between ==== and economic growth consequences (see, as instance, (Hartmann et al., 2017; Hidalgo, 2021)). However, the empirical estimate of the determinants of ==== in the research above necessitates attention to selection on unobservable, reverse causality, and measurement problems. It is crucial to emphasize that using those above ‘proximate’ causes of development to explain the global divided of ==== is theoretically unacceptable.====In light of these issues, I depend on a parallel and well-established research line that states political stability, financial stability and environmental quality as the primary predictor of economic success. The political system of a nation accounts for a significant portion of the variation in economic growth rates among countries. Alesina and Perotti (1996) explain these variabilities by using the index of socio-political instability. Among the components of such an index, indicators such as a lack of democracy and the prevalence of political violence are quite important. Political insecurity diminishes certainty and, as a result, hurts important macroeconomic factors, including investment, consumption, employment, and inflation, by boosting interest rates. Thus, economic development rates will slow over time (Blomberg, 1996, Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoǧlu, 2008, Rodrik, 1991). Although poor-quality economic and political institutions are common in many countries across the world, they are often blamed on the country’s geography or history (Acemoglu et al., 2001, Nikolaev and Salahodjaev, 2017).====An interest in the subject of financial stability comes from both an academic and policy standpoint. Since the crisis, this issue has risen to the forefront of scholarly discourse (Arcand et al., 2015). A critical argument for addressing the issue of financial stability is because it is a public good: Since its usage does not preclude someone else from doing the same, it is a non-rival good and non-excludable. In the wake of financial crises, new rules are recommended to monitor and structure the financial system to protect it as a common benefit for society (Creel et al., 2015). The research on ==== caused by environmental risk has concentrated chiefly on determining the effect of climate change on the global economy. They argue that climate change will have major consequences for the global economy (Diffenbaugh and Burke, 2019, Hsiang et al., 2017, Jadoon et al., 2021). Thus, the continuance of underdevelopment stems from the evolving instability of institutions (Maseland, 2021, Nunn, 2020). According to some researchers, institutional variables may be more basic in explaining the large and long-lasting disparities in ==== across nations (Vu, 2020a). Therefore, this necessitates an investigation of the role of political and financial stability in determining the global economic complexity pattern.====According to Stern (2004), the relationship between ==== and the environmental qality is based on the development of the four economic structural components. In the early stages of ==== development, production size and industrial structure play the most significant role in influencing the environmental qality (Hu et al., 2020). To put it another way, the growth of output and the shift from primary to secondary industries have led to a rise in ==== emissions. Therefore, pollution control methods may not be viable or efficient at this early stage because of the high set-up cost investment and limited production scale (Stern, 2004). As an economy’s knowledge advances, a major shift in the production input mix and technological advancement dominates the aforementioned aspects. Regarding the latter, less harmful inputs are used in place of more harmful ones. Using more sophisticated manufacturing techniques reduces the environmental impact of the final product, resulting in reduced energy consumption and lower levels of pollution (Apergis et al., 2018, Can and Gozgor, 2017). Thus, more economic complexity is correlated with less environmental deterioration (Chu, 2021).====Why do we choose Belt and Road Initiative ==== countries? Economic development in ==== countries has been remarkable in recent decades. Furthermore, investment in ==== nations is also rising (Wang et al., 2020). ==== nations make for ==== of the world’s population, with over ==== people (Worldometers.info, 2019). This enormous population represents a tremendous development potential, but it also significantly strains the environment (Apergis & Ozturk, 2015). ==== nations confront a wide range of obstacles in addition to the advances (Wang et al., 2018). ====, rapid corruption, insufficient stability of institutions caused by social unfairness, and environmental stress produced by excessive energy consumption and old technologies are the most prominent concerns (Danish et al., 2019). Hence, these nations account for more than ==== of global ==== emissions (He et al., 2020). Political and financial stability has emerged as an essential concern for sustainable development, among other issues (Mehlum et al., 2006).====The purpose of this research is to determine the impact of deeply established institutional stability on ====. Therefore, this study goes beyond past research in determining whether and how slowly emerging institutional traits translate to global disparities in ====. The present research indicates that nations with institutional instability, on average, suffer from persistent underdevelopment measured by lower ==== per capita levels (Acemoglu et al., 2001; Rodrik et al., 2004). However, ==== is used to forecast future patterns of growth and development based on the availability of productive capacities inside an economy (Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009, Hidalgo, 2021). In particular, the ability to generate a varied variety of complex goods allows nations with stronger production capacity to maintain development for longer periods (Felipe et al., 2012, Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009). Recent research suggests that ====, rather than ==== per capita, helps comprehend cross-country development.====Given the purpose of the investigation, the current study adds to the existing literature in various ways. First, this study demonstrates that political stability and financial stability, captured by the Political Risk Service ==== positively impact economic complexity, Using data from up to 56 ==== economies. To account for the expected positive correlation between institutional stability and ====, I evaluate the significance of selection on unobservable in order to establish a sound foundation for consistent inference. Second, to acquire further insights, the research incorporates economic freedom and ==== emissions into the model to evaluate its influence on economic complexity. Third, following Acemoglu et al. (2014), I provide evidence of the importance of stability over ==== accumulation in influencing the global persistence of underdevelopment. Fourth, we also investigated the function of institutional stability as a moderator in the link between ==== and ====. Economic regulations are administered by national institutions, and policymaking for environmental sustainability is difficult without a prominent role for institutions. The empirical findings of a mediation study corroborate the proposed mechanism for understanding the link between institutional stability and ====, which is consistent with the basic assumption. According to the authors, there has been no study on the issue in the literature.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section ==== addresses the theoretical framework, while Section ==== describes the data and methodology. Section ==== contains empirical results and discussion.

The findings show that ==== (represented by domestic credit, and money supply) reduces poverty; however, the weak institutional quality reduces the positive effect of ","Poverty continues to be one of the biggest difficulties confronting humanity today, and alleviating poverty has become one of the most difficult tasks facing developing countries in their drive for long-term development (Guo, Zhou, & Liu, 2019). According to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2020 report, severe global poverty grew from 8.2 % in 2019 to 8.8 % in 2020. According to the report, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic would cause an extra 71 million people to slip into severe poverty by 2020. The report also showed that roughly 26 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will be surviving below the international poverty line (UN, 2020). This rapid rise in poverty is associated with the formation of dangerous social groups, conflicts, stigmatization, low standard of living, economic hardships, lack of freedom, fear for the future, unemployment, lack of education, and poor diet (Appiah-Otoo & Song, 2021a). As a result, governments continue to place a high priority on eradicating poverty in all of its manifestations (Acheampong, Appiah-Otoo et al., 2021).====Recently, many scholars have focused on understanding the drivers of poverty alleviation (Cepparulo, Cuestas, & Intartaglia, 2017). A growing body of literature has also explored the effect of financial development on poverty eradication. According to Appiah-Otoo and Song (2021a), financial development affects poverty in the following ways. First, financial development makes it simpler for the poor to get credit by addressing information asymmetry and excessive borrowing costs. Financial development also helps the poor to start microenterprises using their savings or borrowed funds, enabling greater financial services access, boosting employment, and improving household incomes, thereby decreasing poverty. Finally, financial development facilitates risk management, corporate control, resource allocation to investment projects, trade facilitation, and innovation, all of which indirectly alleviate poverty (trickle-down theory). However, recent scholars have also documented that financial development increases poverty when there is a high cost of borrowing and when it increases income inequality (Acheampong, Appiah-Otoo et al., 2021). For instance, Jauch and Watzka (2016) showed that financial development increases income inequality for a sample of 138 developed and developing countries. These inconclusive arguments could suggest that regional or income-specific differences could matter since they relate to the level of institutions. Consequently, this study re-examines the finance-poverty nexus by exploring the role of institutions. Institutions which are defined as the “rules of the game in a society” (North, 1990) is well established to play an essential role in the financial and economic development of a country (Acheampong et al., 2021, Marcelin and Mathur, 2014, Rajan and Zingales, 2003). According to Marcelin and Mathur (2014), a developed institutional setting reduces risk, uncertainties, and ensures equitable distribution of resources thereby leading to improved financial development and poverty reduction. Conversely, a weak institutional setting amplifies financial disintermediation, backwardness, and sustained underdevelopment which might hinder the progress of new financial markets and products thereby leading to underdeveloped financial development and exacerbating poverty (Marcelin & Mathur, 2014). These suggest that institutions play an essential role in the finance-poverty nexus. However, empirical evidence on the direct and moderating role of institutional quality in the finance-poverty nexus remains scarce with the existing studies also producing inconclusive findings. For instance, Cepparulo et al. (2017) found that institutions played and financial development are complementary drivers of poverty reduction. Conversely, Singh and Huang (2015) found that institutions mitigate the positive impact of financial development on poverty. Thus, institutions and financial development are substitute drivers of poverty reduction. Kaidi, Mensi, and Ben Amor (2019) also found an inconclusive effect on the role of institutions in the finance-poverty nexus. Besides these conflicting findings, the financial system in most developing economies, especially in SSA countries remains underdeveloped as compared to their counterparts in South Asia, North America, Middle East and North Africa, European Union, East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean (see Figs. 1 and 2). This could be attributed to the weak institutional framework governing the financial system in SSA (Allen et al., 2011, Appiah-Otoo and Song, 2021bbb). However, studies exploring the moderating role of institutional quality in the finance-poverty nexus in the case of SSA are scarce. To the best of our knowledge, only Singh and Huang (2015) focused on 37 SSA, however, this study did not consider the regional differences of SSA sub-regions which might undermine the relevance of their study for policy purposes. To this end, the objective of this study is to re-examine the finance-poverty nexus by exploring the role of institutions for a sample of 16 West African countries. This study also estimates the institutional quality thresholds at which financial development will effectively reduce poverty.====This study focuses on West Africa for the following reasons. First, this region has one of the weakest institutional quality frameworks in the sub-region (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows the country-specific averages of the institutional quality measures. It can be seen that most of the countries have negative averages of the institutional quality measures, except political stability and rule of law for Benin, rule of law, control of corruption, government effectiveness, political stability, and voice and accountability for Cabo Verde, rule of law, government effectiveness, and voice and accountability for Ghana, and voice and accountability for Senegal which were above zero. These suggest that the region suffers from weak institutional quality which might undermine the performance of the financial system to effectively reduce poverty. Also, most of the counties in West Africa have seen a marginal increase in poverty due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, except for Benin and Guinea (see Fig. 4). Thus, knowing the role of financial development and institutional quality in the poverty process will aid in making effective policy decisions to combat poverty in West Africa.====This study is novel in the following ways. First, this study used six different measures of institutional quality indicators measured by rule of law, control of corruption, government effectiveness, voice and accountability, political stability, and regulatory quality further classified into economic governance (regulation quality and government effectiveness), political governance (voice and accountability and political stability), and institutional governance (rule of law and control of corruption). Finally, this study computed the institutional quality thresholds at which financial development will effectively reduce poverty. The findings showed that finance reduces poverty in West Africa; however, the weak institutional quality inhibits the positive impact of finance on poverty reduction. The study established that the institutional quality thresholds at which domestic credit could reduce poverty are: rule of law (0.6), regulation quality (0.1), control of corruption (1.6), government effectiveness (0.1), and political stability (0.3) on the scale of −2.5–2.5. Finally, the institutional quality thresholds at which money supply could reduce poverty are rule of law (2.5), regulation quality (0.3), control of corruption (2.0), government effectiveness (1.5), and political stability (1.4) on the scale of −2.5–2.5, whilst the interaction effect of domestic credit, money supply, and voice and accountability were insignificant.","Financial development, institutional improvement, poverty reduction: The multiple challenges in West Africa",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822001065,14 November 2022,2022,Research Article,36.0

The strategy has thus set very strict environmental targets to be reached by the European agricultural sector by 2030, among which: reducing the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50 %; lowering fertiliser use by 20 % and reducing by 50 % the expenditure for antimicrobials (European Commission, 2020).====The impacts of these strategies can be significant in terms of food production, use of natural resources and chemical inputs, as well as in terms of socio-economic effects on farms and rural territories. Among these impacts, recently, food security concerns have gained particular attention as the war in Ukraine has risen global food insecurity issues, decreasing from one side global offer of important commodities like wheat and, from the other side, further exacerbating the rising of food prices and input costs (like energy and fertilisers). The European Commission, in this context, has proposed a range of short and medium-term actions to increase global food security and to sustain farmers and consumers. These measures, although according to the Commission should be aimed at helping agriculture and food supply chains becoming more resilient and sustainable, in line with the F2F strategy, have been highly criticized for their eventual negative environmental impacts (European Commission, 2022).====Thus, in this context of global concerns about food security and its trade-off with environmental objectives, it becomes even more relevant for evidence-informed policymaking, to provide ex-ante information about the likely impacts on agriculture of the imposition of stringent environmental targets, both in terms of trade-offs with production levels and, also, in terms of the eventual synergies or trade-offs among the different environmental domains. In fact, policy coherence is highly important when dealing with multiple objectives policies, as it is in the case of the F2F and EU climate policy, and assessing the synergies and trade-offs among objectives is very relevant in order to ensure sustainable development European Commission, (2019b).====In principle, the costs to society to implement these policy objectives can be offset by the benefits in terms of environmental and human health improvements (Beckman, Ivanic, & Jelliffe, 2021), although if it is important that these are accurately assessed. From a private-side perspective, instead, proper quantification of the private/agricultural costs is useful to understand market impacts and eventually have an assessment of potential entry points for policies supporting the transition.====To conduct such an assessment, it is needed a model that can represent the heterogeneity of the professional and market-oriented agriculture, both at territorial and at structural level, also including its input use, and GHG emissions. Economic models can provide these types of evaluation using available agricultural information for the entire EU, such as the data provided by the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), a pan-European survey that collects information on thousands of farms with a standardized and harmonized approach across EU Member States (MS).==== Among the various models that can provide such an assessment, the microeconomic approach of Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) allows considering the technical aspects of agricultural production and of resource use, perfectly calibrating to the observed production activities (Heckelei et al., 2012, Paris and Howitt, 1998; de Frahan et al., 2016).====In this context, the objective of the present study is to present a methodology that is based on an agro-economic supply model, the AGRITALIM model (Cortignani et al., 2022), that uses FADN data to provide an assessment of the economic private costs for professional farms deriving from the implementation of some of the environmental targets as set by the F2F and by the objectives of the EU climate law, and to assess the synergies and trade-offs between the different environmental objectives. In particular, the attention here is on the reduction of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and antimicrobials used and of GHG emissions generated by the farms.====To allow the simulation of the most relevant F2F and GHG reduction targets, the AGRITALIM model has been here improved in two main ways; first, the model was extended by allowing the assessment of GHG emissions using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology adapted at the farm level (Coderoni & Vanino 2022). Secondly it now incorporates data on antimicrobials expenditure as derived from FADN dataset. The AGRITALIM model, with these improvements, is then applied to Italian agriculture as a case study, to highlight the potentialities and eventual weaknesses of the tool.====Five different scenarios are simulated; these consider: ==== the reduction of 20 % in chemical fertilizers use; ==== the reduction of 50 % of more hazardous pesticides; ==== the 50 % reduction in the expenditure of antimicrobials; ====) the previous three targets together and ====) an ad-hoc targeted reduction in GHG emissions. These scenarios are all alternative, expect for the ====) which is a combination of the first three. Impacts are evaluated in terms of Added Value (AV) variations and of environmental indicators. As environmental externalities generation can be highly interlinked, special attention is also given to synergies and trade-offs among scenarios in terms of environmental outcome to appraise the eventual coherence among policy objectives.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the background of the analysis and the literature review; Section 3 the dataset and methodologies used; Section 4 the results of the analysis; Section 5 the discussion and policy implication and Section 6 the conclusions.",The impacts of environmental and climate targets on agriculture: Policy options in Italy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822001089,9 November 2022,2022,Research Article,37.0

This study presents three main findings regarding the impact of mass shootings on firearm demand and the moderating roles played by political and regulatory climates. First, mass shootings led to an immediate but temporary increase in gun sales. This effect continued for approximately 3–6 months after the incidents and was larger for shootings with a greater number of fatalities. Second, the association between mass shootings and gun sales was significant only under Democratic presidents. The party affiliation of the state legislature and state-level gun control did not moderate this association. Third, the increased firearm sales after mass shootings did not result in a higher level of firearm ownership. It appeared most purchases were made by current gun owners stockpiling additional firearms, thus indicating the fear of stricter gun control as a likely motivation. This study offers the following policy implications: (a) the public debates concerning gun violence could have the unintended consequence of raising gun demand among current owners, (b) the message of tightening gun control could increase the total stock of firearms in circulation, and (c) the regulations to prevent future mass shootings may be better addressed by the state government as a state-level regulation does not trigger demand response among potential consumers.","On June 12, 2016, a 29-year-old security guard left his van outside Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, with a semiautomatic rifle and handgun. Later that night, he turned into an active shooter who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in one of the deadliest mass shootings in US history. In the wake of this shooting, the public debate on the issue of gun violence emerged, covering a wide range of topics, including background checks, mental health screening, and tracking gun access. One side of the debate argues that increased firearm ownership by law-abiding citizens can prevent future gun violence (Kruis et al., 2021). Supporters of stricter gun control counter that restricting access to certain types of firearms would result in safer communities (Santaella-Tenorio et al., 2016). As the debate develops in Congress and the White House, news media reports that gun enthusiasts line up at gun shops to buy more firearms and ammunition.====The academic literature has documented surges in firearm sales after high-profile mass shootings. A study on the 2012 Newtown shooting and 2015 San Bernardino shooting showed that the incidents were associated with a 40–50% increase in handgun acquisitions over the expected volume in California and adjacent regions (Studdert et al., 2017). A study of six mass shootings from 2000 to 2010 showed a delayed but significant increase in federal background checks, an important barometer of national firearm sales (Wallace, 2015). The consumer response to mass shootings has been found to be particularly strong when shootings were committed by internationally influenced terrorists or occurred during Obama’s presidency (Chau, 2018). Moreover, the association between mass shootings and handgun sales is more pronounced when the incidents garnered extensive media coverage (Liu & Wiebe, 2019).====Why do people buy guns after mass shootings? One possible explanation is that mass shootings increase the fear for personal safety, and this fear response motivates people to arm themselves. Mass shootings are not the deadliest form of homicide, but they may incite the most fear among the public because of their random nature and the inability to predict and prevent them (Fox & DeLateur, 2014). The Gallup poll in 2019 showed that about half of Americans were “very” or “somewhat” worried about being a victim of a future terrorist attack (Gallup, 2019). In a survey immediately after the El Paso shooting, approximately 48% of the respondents expressed concerns about possible high-profile mass shootings in their communities. The fear that a family member or oneself could be the next victim of a mass shooting could spur the desire for self-protection and create a demand for self-protective measures, including owning a handgun (Azrael et al., 2017, Cook and Ludwig, 1996, Ehrlich and Saito, 2010). Indeed, gun owners cite personal safety or protection as their primary reason for owning firearms (Pew Research Center, 2017).====An alternative hypothesis is that mass shootings increase the concerns over future access to firearms. The media coverage of mass shootings and ensuing discussion of gun control might incur fear of additional legal restrictions on firearms (Porfiri et al., 2019). Consequently, potential consumers might opt to purchase firearms immediately. For example, a New York Times article reported surges in gun sales after calls for stricter gun regulations (Aisch & Keller, 2016). Similarly, there was a dramatic increase in gun sales in the months prior to the 2008 US presidential election, in which Obama emerged as a favorite to win (Depetris-Chauvin, 2015). The fear that Obama would push for stricter gun regulations was considered a primary contributing factor to the stockpiling behaviors among gun owners. A Bloomberg article explained that the association between mass shootings and gun sales broke down under the Trump administration (Rojanasakul, 2017). It appears that in a more permissive regulatory environment, gun consumers no longer find mass shootings as a trigger for stricter gun control.====The fear of stricter gun control could be partially due to the increased legislative activity after mass shootings. A single mass shooting has been associated with a 15% increase in firearm bills submitted to the State Congress in the year after the incident (Luca et al., 2020). Moreover, incidents with greater fatalities have been found to evoke larger policy responses, with each additional fatality leading to 2.5% more bills being introduced. The association between mass shootings and legislative activity appears to be further magnified by media coverage, indicating the role of public attention and salience in policymaking. The overall regulatory climate could complicate the consumer response to mass shootings because Democrats and Republicans respond differently to gun violence. Depending on which party is in power, gun control might be tightened or retained after mass shootings.====Given the interactions between mass shootings and policy changes, it is likely that the consumer response to mass shootings varies according to the regulatory environment and governing political party. While there has been scholarly research on gun sales after mass shootings (Brock and Routon, 2020, Chau, 2018, Studdert et al., 2017, Wallace, 2015), as well as a number of investigations into the time series patterns (Liu & Wiebe, 2019), prior research has not considered the potential influence of regulatory and political environments on the association between mass shootings and firearm demand. Existing studies have suggested that the surge in gun sales might be more salient under Democrat-controlled legislature (Rojanasakul, 2017) and in states with strong gun control (Depetris-Chauvin, 2015). As Democrats generally favor more restrictive gun laws, mass shootings occurring under a Democrat-led government would lead to additional regulations on firearm access and use. Hence, potential gun buyers may feel that they need to buy firearms before it is too late. However, we might not see a comparable consumer response under Republican-controlled legislature because they generally oppose new gun restrictions (Luca et al., 2020).====It is also possible that under a Democrat-led government, people arm themselves with fear that the government may not offer protection against mass shootings. Democrats are generally believed to be weak in terms of crimes and violations (Holian, 2004). Those who agree with this view may find mass shootings as a confirmation of their belief and thus increase the demand for protective weapons.====This study examined the association between mass shootings and gun sales, focusing on three issues that remain unanswered in the literature: (a) whether mass shootings lead to a permanent or temporary increase in gun sales and how long the effect persists, (b) how regulatory climates and the governing political party moderate the association between mass shootings and gun sales, and (c) whether the surge in gun sales is driven by self-protection motives or fear of stricter gun control. To answer our research questions, we constructed novel data of federal background checks matched with administrative data on state characteristics and firearm law provisions from 1999 to 2016. We then estimated a series of dynamic regression models that link the count of federal background checks to shooting-related characteristics and indicators of federal and state regulatory environments. The results showed that an uptick in gun sales emerged immediately after mass shootings and lasted approximately 3–6 months. We also found that the association between mass shootings and gun sales was moderated by the party affiliation of the federal government. Finally, we found suggestive evidence that mass shootings did not result in a higher prevalence of gun ownership. This result points to the stockpiling behaviors of current gun owners as the likely explanation for the increased firearm demand after mass shootings.====This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we examine the association between mass shootings and firearm demand at the national level. Utilizing data from 49 US states, this study provides generalizable results concerning consumer responses to mass casualty shootings in the US. Second, this study offers comprehensive analyses of how the party affiliation of the government and firearm regulatory climate influence consumer response to mass shootings. Our findings suggest that public debates concerning gun violence could have the unintended consequence of raising firearm demand, and hence policymakers need to consider the approaches with the least repercussions among potential gun buyers. Finally, we parse out the motivations for gun purchases by examining the association between the proxy of gun ownership and mass shootings. Prior research has used qualitative research designs involving interviews at gun shops or descriptive analyses of opinion surveys, and thus could not offer generalizable evidence on the motivations behind gun-buying behaviors. In the current study, we use data drawn from various administrative sources to show that increases in gun sales after mass shootings are partially explained by current gun owners’ stockpiling behaviors.","The effects of mass shootings on gun sales: Motivations, mechanisms, policies and regulations",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000977,28 October 2022,2022,Research Article,38.0

This is important as central bankers have widened the range of instruments in their monetary policy toolbox. Specifically, we estimate a proxy for the monetary policy stance and then analyse a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive with stochastic volatility model to explain the BoE’s trade-offs when making policy decisions and as well as to demonstrate dynamic impacts of monetary policy on ==== and economic growth. The empirical results show that our estimated monetary policy proxy is better at capturing the BoE’s policy when the ==== lower bound becomes binding.","The implementation of monetary policy has changed significantly since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The consensus view, prior to the Great Recession, was that the policy rate was the relevant instrument of monetary policy and the short-term interest rate was the appropriate indicator of the monetary policy stance. However, the reduction of the policy rate to its effective lower bound in response to the Great Recession that followed the GFC meant that central bankers had to embrace what were considered as unconventional monetary policy instruments such as quantitative easing and asset purchase programmes. These unconventional monetary policy instruments have increasingly become more commonplace (Borio and Zabai, 2016, Karagiannis et al., 2010, Kucharcukova et al., 2016, Lewis and Seidman, 2008, Rogoff, 2017, Wang, 2016, Bank for International Settlements (2019)) and central bankers now refer to a range of monetary policy instruments as additional stimulus measures (Eichengreen, 2012) in their monetary policy toolbox (Bernanke, 2006, Ramsden, 2020).====The issue facing central bankers is how to capture the monetary policy stance and the effect of monetary policy shocks on the wider economy when there is an expansion of the monetary policy instruments. In this paper we address this issue for the UK by estimating a proxy for the monetary policy stance of the Bank of England (BoE) over the period January 1993 to December 2015 when the BoE was using both conventional and unconventional monetary policy instruments. Prior to the Great Recession, the BoE used a single policy tool – the Bank rate – to achieve their objectives. However, during the Great Recession the BoE judged that it could not practically reduce the Bank rate below 0.5%, the effective lower bound (ELB), and therefore the only way that it could loosen the stance of monetary policy was through asset purchases. Consequently, in March 2009 the first quantitative easing programme (QE1) was launched followed by QE2 (October 2011-February 2012) and QE3 (July 2012).====The aforementioned changes to monetary policy instruments also present difficulties in modelling the BoE’s response to inflation and the output gap as well as capturing the impact of its monetary policy on the wider economy. To address this issue, we use a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model with stochastic volatility as developed by Primiceri (2005) to examine how changes in the monetary policy proxy affects the economy while allowing for different responses over time. This is important as the TVP-VAR model allows us to quantify the reaction and transmission mechanism of monetary policy even if the data includes regime changes (see, Aastveit, Carriero, Clark, & Marcellino, 2017 and Baumeister & Benati, 2013). Additionally, evidence that asset market frictions, which are required for QE to work, are state dependent and changeable, means that the impact of QE can also be time-varying (Haldene, 2015). As Nasir (2021) has noted the time varying impact on the economy is not only a feature of QE but also the conventional interest rate instrument. For our proxy to be meaningful it needs to capture the monetary policy stance as given by the short-term interest rate for the pre-effective lower bound period. We test this by comparing the monetary policy shocks arising from the two different measures, the short-term policy rate and our monetary policy proxy, using the TVP-VAR model for the pre-ELB period and checking whether they differ from each other.====Different approaches have been used in the literature to examine the impact of monetary policy over both normal (pre-ELB) and non-normal (ELB) periods. One approach is to employ the medium-term interest rate to detect the dynamic relationship between monetary policy and macroeconomic activity when the short-term interest rate approaches the effective lower bound and monetary transmission works through the medium-term interest rate (Nakajima (2011b). The foremost approach in the literature is to use the short-term interest rate for normal times which is positive but estimate an equivalent synthetic interest rate, the shadow interest rate, for the non-normal period which is below the lower bound and can be negative. The shadow rate is the interest rate that would have been possible if the lower bound did not bind. The construction of this hypothetical rate allows a direct comparison to be made between the policy rate in normal times and the shadow rate in non-normal times.====There are three prominent methods identified in the literature to estimate the shadow rate (see, Ichiue & Ueno, 2018 for a discussion). The first and most common approach is to use a term structure model (which has been used by Rezende & Ristiniemi, 2018 and Carriero, Mouabbi, & Vangelista, 2018 for the UK). The second approach, the correlation-based approach (Ichiue & Ueno, 2018), estimates the shadow interest rate by identifying the underlying correlations between the short-term interest rate and other financial and monetary variables in the pre-ELB period. Here, Kamada and Sugo (2006) estimate a shadow rate for Japan using two intermediate variables, namely bank lending rates and the lending attitude of financial institutions. Lombardi & Zhu, 2014 use dynamic factor analysis to choose a large monetary policy dataset for the US comprising interest rates, monetary aggregates and the Federal Reserve’s assets and liabilities to determine the shadow rate while Doh and Choi (2016) calculate the shadow rate for the US based on government and private sector borrowing conditions only, represented by medium- and long-term interest rate and interest rate spreads, which they argue captures the impact of the asset purchase programmes in the US. More recently, in their publication in the ====, Babecka-Kucharcukova, Claeys, and Vasicek (2016) estimate a monetary conditions index (MCI) that synthetises euro area monetary conditions based on a number of indicators including interest rates, monetary aggregates and selected balance sheet items. The Babecka-Kucharcukova et al. (2016) MCI is considered similar to a shadow rate and should be able to capture shifts in the European Central Bank’s (ECB) policy. The advantage of these approaches over those that “back out” the shadow rate using the term structure model is that they allow the underlying correlations in the data to specify the shadow rate and are model free in the sense that they do not depend on any specific term structure model (Lombardi & Zhu, 2014) or on the no-arbitrage restriction (Doh & Choi, 2016). The third approach is to use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model (Kitamura, 2010), although this makes the shadow rate dependent on the specific model specification.====Our paper has a number of distinguishing features. First, our approach differs from most of the existing literature which models UK monetary policy given the zero lower bound. Rezende and Ristiniemi (2018) estimate a shadow rate whereas Baumeister and Benati (2013) use the short term interest rate and the spread between the 10 year yield and the policy rate and Nasir (2021) in the ==== uses the ex-post real short term policy rate as a proxy for the monetary policy stance. Similar to Babecka-Kucharcukova et al. (2016), we estimate a synthetic proxy of the monetary policy stance to study the trade-offs (between inflation and economic growth) and the transmission of monetary policy. We consider the effective monetary policy stance to be an unobserved variable (Avery, 1979) affecting economic activity and inflation. We estimate our monetary policy proxy, which summarises the monetary policy stance, as the common factor underlying the movement in interest rates and money supply aggregates.==== Specifically, we use data on the short- and medium-term interest rates, monetary aggregates and the size of the BoE balance sheet over the entire period under review (1993–2015). Our inclusion of these monetary aggregates has its origins in the observation of Friedman (1968) that ‘inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon’ implying that changes in the money supply may contain valuable information on current and future levels of spending. The BoE considers broad money to be more informative than narrow money (notes, coins and sight deposits) on how monetary policy is transmitted through the wider economy. Therefore, monitoring broad money is considered by the BoE as important for assessing the effectiveness of QE (McLeay, Radia, & Thomas, 2014). This emphasis on broad money also means that medium-term interest rates (see, Nakajima, 2011b) may not serve as a sufficient indicator of monetary policy stance in the UK although are important in the context of gilt purchases (Joyce, Tong, & Woods, 2011).====We employ Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to separate the common underlying factors driving these monetary policy indicators from the idiosyncratic factors affecting individual indicators and we use these extracted common factors as our monetary policy proxy. The advantage of our approach is that rather than calculating a synthetic or artificial interest rate, based on the correlations in the pre-ELB period only (Ichiue and Uenom (2018)), we use the correlations between interest rates and monetary aggregates across the entire period which creates a more direct link to the Central Bank’s monetary policy instruments during the non-normal period. Using PCA over the entire period also means that the monetary policy proxy that we estimate accounts for the co-variation in the interest rate and monetary data across both normal and non-normal times. Additionally, as our monetary policy proxy summarises the monetary policy stance, the components of the proxy do not need to be altered even if the BoE changes its policy instruments.====Also, our paper differs from Babecka-Kucharcukova et al. (2016) and Egea and Hierro (2019) by using a TVP-VAR model as proposed in Nasir (2021). The TVP-VAR model allows us to further investigate any changes in the Central Bank’s preference between inflation versus economic activity stabilisation and also allows us to capture the evolution of the transmission of monetary policy – particularly for the period when moving from the conventional policy instrument to unconventional instruments. With the TVP-VAR model, we can also estimate some important indicators, such as the policy smoothing parameter, the inflation target and short-term vs long-term responses of monetary policy, which are essential for understanding the BoE’s monetary policy in different periods.====The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data set that we use in the study; in Section 3, we provide an explanation of how we estimate our proxy for the monetary policy stance. We also provide an overview of the sign-restricted TVP-VAR model. We report the results of our analysis of the evolution of monetary policy in Section 4. In Section 5 we present a robustness analysis using alternative proxies for the BoE’s policy actions while Section 6 concludes.","Monetary policy, trade-offs and the transmission of UK Monetary Policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000989,26 October 2022,2022,Research Article,39.0

A traditional common view is that financial stability and price stability are complementary and mutually consistent objectives (Bernanke, Gertler, & Gilchrist, 1999) which can be simultaneously achieved by a flexible inflation targeting regime. Inflation targeting anchors inflationary expectations. Anchored inflationary expectations guide consumption and investment and thus under inflation targeting, overinvestment and failures to service the accrued debt can be avoided (Akram & Eitrheim, 2008). Stable inflation may also promote predictable returns on investment, and therefore, may positively affect financial stability (Schwartz, 1998). Inflation targeting leads to improved transparency and accountability of the central banks especially in the case of emerging market economies where the initial credibility of the central banks may be low. This may also have positive spillover effects on the financial sector stability.====However, the literature especially after global financial crisis, suggests that inflation targeting as a monetary policy framework may exacerbate financial instability especially if the episodes are stemming from accumulation of financial imbalances, such as excessive credit growth and abnormally high asset prices (Tobal & Menna, 2020). It is argued that central banks with an inflation target may become myopic and only concentrate on commodity prices and therefore may not pay enough attention to financial developments – such as a credit-financed real estate boom – and thus inflation targeting policy may exacerbate financial instability (Woodford, 2012). Giavazzi and Giovannini (2010) argue that inflation targeting, which ignores financial fragility stemming from the liquidity transformation role of the financial system, can produce interest rates that push the economy to “low interest rate trap”, which induces too much risk taking and increases the risk of financial instability. Thus, inflation targeting may become inconsistent with financial stability objective and monetary policy may have to be used to dampen financial imbalances (Adrian and Shin, 2009, Borio and Lowe, 2002, Borio et al., 2001, Cúrdia and Woodford, 2016, Gourio et al., 2018, Rajan, 2006, Svensson, 2012, Svensson, 2018, Tobal and Menna, 2020, Van der Ghote, 2018, Woodford, 2012).====Further, in case of emerging market economies, financial imbalances may arise because of these economies’ excessive dependence on external capital inflows (Rey, 2015, Tobal and Menna, 2020, Tobal, 2017). Inflation targeting may mitigate these effects because of the predictability of the monetary policy and subsequent improved investor confidence.====Most of the empirical studies however, are focused on advanced economies (Akram and Eitrheim, 2008, Baxa et al., 2013, Borio and Lowe, 2004) only and miss the positive spillover effects of inflation targeting on financial stability. We find very few papers which discuss the issue in the case of emerging market economies. Fouejieu (2017) studies 26 emerging market economies with 13 inflation targeting countries and concludes that the financial stability in targeting countries is more fragile as compared to their non-targeting counterparts. In another study, Sethi and Acharya (2020) using data for 5 targeting and 7 non-targeting countries in the Asia Pacific region show that inflation targeting adversely affects financial stability. Fouejieu (2017) and Sethi and Acharya (2020) use a specification mostly suitable to advanced economies and do not control for time effects. The specification ignores the role of international common shocks which are important components of the emerging markets financial stability.====In this paper studying data for 64 emerging market economies and a specification suitable to emerging market economies, we find positive and significant spillover effects of inflation targeting adoption on banking sector resilience and external capital inflows. Overall, we find no adverse impact of inflation targeting on financial stability. Our results support “complementarity view” of the inflation targeting and financial sector stability and thus have important policy implications for emerging market economies which are under inflation targeting lite==== regime and looking forward to the adoption of inflation targeting. We recommend inflation targeting lite countries to adopt IT as their full-fledge monetary policy tool.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the data. In section 3, we discuss different indicators of financial stability and construct indices for financial and external sector stability. In section 4, we address the identification strategy.

However, doubters and critics differ in their opinion and foretell the possibility of growing anguish against the global economy among the populace worldwide (Garg & Sushil, 2021). The global economy has created both winners and losers, but growing trade disparity, wage inequality, cultural imperialism, and the rising unemployment rate have intensified its costs to the losers (James, 2017, Martin, 2018, Naudé and Coetzee, 2004). The previous World Bank economist Branko Milanovic performs research on the distribution of wealth worldwide (from 1988 to 2008). He finds that people who come out from poverty and growing middle class from emerging economies are winners. In contrast to the middle class from industrialized nations has lost in many ways. He raises questions about ignoring the lopsided allocation of wealth globally (Cazurrra et al., 2017). He et al. (2020) suggest reframing the policies so that everyone could enjoy the distribution of value produced by globalization.====Recent developments in the world have crumbled global integration. The proliferation of regional and bilateral trade pacts in near time and disappointment from the Cancun WTO conference demonstrates the growing anguish from the open market. It is intimidated by the dominance of the western countries and rising populism in the developed world (Allen & Raynor, 2004). In industrializing economies, populists, particularly Evo Morales in Bolivia and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, have overturned pro-market policies by restricting import and foreign investment (Cazurrra et al., 2017). Populist parties supporting anti-immigrant sentiment are gaining popularity in different parts of Europe. The European Union's idea seems to be in danger (Moffitt, 2018). Bourguignon (2015) argues that societal equality economies, particularly France and Sweden, are also witnessing a rise in economic disparity.====However, it has been observed that emerging market countries are still moving towards globalization, and developed nations have started taking precautionary measures to curtail the ill impacts of globalization. Thereby, this study has selected the cases accordingly. India has gained a lot after economic reforms, and thereby, we have taken its case to analyze the gains of globalization. Conversely, the United States of America is chosen for our research pertaining to its recent policy reforms in the direction of deglobalization. We have applied the situation-actor-process (SAP) learning-action-performance (LAP) framework in the contemporary study. The ‘‘situation–actor–process’’ (SAP) and ‘‘learning–action–performance’’ (LAP) framework is based on system thinking (Garg & Sushil, 2018; Mangla et al., 2014; Pramod & Banwet, 2011; Siva Kumar & Anbanandam, 2020; Dhakate and Joshi (2020); Deshmukh et al. (2022) Sushil, 2000, Sushil, 2009). The SAP–LAP approach assisted in understanding the economic crisis that forced India to adopt pro-market reforms. Further, we have tried to analyze the 'actors' and ‘processes’ that accelerated India's globalization process. Likewise, we have highlighted the problems that forced the American government to opt for the deglobalization strategies. Then, we identified the ‘actors’ and ‘process’ that accelerated deglobalization thinking in America. Based on SAP synthesis, we have proposed a few measures to improve key performance areas of both the country. This article has tried to validate that emerging markets such as India have reaped significant benefits from globalization. In contrast, the industrialized world has over-globalized itself and is moving in the direction of deglobalization.

Disability is neither a purely medical nor a purely social phenomenon. Rather, it is an outcome of their interplay. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke are associated with impairments that get aggravated by stigma and discrimination in access to educational and medical services and employment. The co-occurrence of NCDs and disabilities poses a considerably higher risk of mortality.====Disability encompasses impairments resulting from congenital disorders, diseases, accidents, or ageing. With increasing age, several physiological changes occur, and the risk of NCDs rises. By age 60, the major burdens of disability and death stem from age-related losses in hearing, seeing and moving, as well as from the NCDs, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Furthermore, aging is taking place alongside other broad social trends that will affect the lives of older people. Demographic and family changes mean that there will be fewer older people with families to care for them (WHO, 2015).====The landmark UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) was passed in 2006. Momentum for the CRPD’s policy and programming changes has continued to increase, and it has now been ratified by more than 170 countries. The CRPD has ensured a concomitant shift in global initiatives, most notably the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2019).",Rural poverty and disability in Ethiopia: Formidable policy challenges,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000758,28 September 2022,2022,Research Article,44.0

As pointed out by Durusu-Ciftci, Ispir, and Yetkiner (2017), the theoretical contributions can be divided into five main strands: Firstly, most models have focused on the allocative role of the financial systems, e.g., Bencivenga and Smith (1991), Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990), Pagano (1993), and Wu, Hou, and Cheng (2010). Secondly, financial markets allow firms to diversify portfolios, to increase liquidity, and hence reduce risks, and thus stimulate growth (Levine, 1991; SaintPaul, 1992). Thirdly, financial development provides an exit mechanism for agents and improves the efficiency of financial intermediation (Arestis et al., 2001, Rousseau and Wachtel, 2000). Fourthly, these markets also foster specialization in entrepreneurship and the adoption of new technologies (Greenwood & Smith, 1997). A final theoretical consideration is financial markets’ ability to impact economic growth through changes in incentives for corporate control (Demirguc-Kunt and Levine, 1996, Jensen and Murphy, 1990).====In this context, access to affordable credit is considered crucial in welfare economics. It may or may not have a positive effect on growth but surely act as an equalizer by providing equal opportunity in this unequal world. In general, credit markets are categorized into two forms: formal and informal financial markets. Formal credit markets as those financial market activities that are usually controlled by the government, while informal credit markets are defined as activities of various financial intermediaries ranging from farmers, moneylenders, friends, relatives, shopkeepers, merchants, traders, and rotating savings and credit associations.====The Indian case provides a compelling study to explore this issue in some detail. The present paper aims at analyzing access to finance based on the usage of formal and informal or both financial services by Indian households. This paper is related to the factors determining the household’s access to credit and also the source of the credit. For this purpose, we use large-scale household-level data for India. Using nationally representative data sets - All India Debt and Investment Survey(AIDIS) unit-level data for the year 2002 and 2012-we focus on the correlates of household characteristics in decisions relating to access of credit, by using a probit model. Then, we focused our attention by using the Heckman two-step model to assess the role of household characteristics in determining the sources of finance(formal vs. informal vs. both credit markets). Our investigation yields several insights about how household’s access to finance works in India, many of them similar to those in other developing countries. Our results show that belonging to higher asset quintiles increases credit availability, but only belonging to higher quintiles have a significant effect on determining the sources of credit. It also observes that the social group plays a significant role in determining the source of credit with the SC and OBC group significantly less likely to borrow from formal sources, whereas the ST group significantly more likely to borrow from formal sources as compared to other social groups. Similarly, when religion is considered, it is observed that followers of Islam are significantly more likely to borrow from formal sources as compared to followers of Hinduism. Finally, when education is considered, it is observed it has an incremental effect on credit access, but only having at least an adult having high school and above level of education has a significant positive impact on the likelihood of a household to borrow from formal sources that too only in 2012. We also observed that households involved in regular wage-earning occupations in urban areas are more likely to take a loan from formal sources. Thus, our paper highlights the importance of placing greater emphasis on addressing demand-side barriers, rather than on improving the physical availability of formal financial services, to promote financial inclusion in India.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we relate the paper with the previous literature. Section 3 describes the sample data used for the study. Section 4 explains the approach and econometric models used to assess the determinants of formal (or, institutional) and informal(or, non-institutional) credit. Empirical results are presented in Section 5. Section 5.1 analyzes how much, where, and for what purposes people borrowed in India during the study period. Whereas, Section 5.2 analyses the incidence of indebtedness using the Probit model, Section 5.3 discusses the findings relating to the household’s borrowing behaviour using Heckman-probit model.

To assist policy makers in deciding whether to host such events, ==== are increasingly used. The literature has recently begun reviewing these studies and has shown that they are at risk of providing misleading policy recommendations if they do not pay more attention to the various specificities of mega-events. This paper identifies 13 modelling issues, examines their implications and discusses how they could be overcome. Fostering a discussion of these issues among scientists could be beneficial for the progress of policy modelling in this specific area.","Policy makers and advisers needing to assess the benefits of a sport or cultural event for a jurisdiction have been restricted to using Input-Output models for decades. However, in the latest years they have increasingly relied on other analytical tools, mostly Cost-Benefit Analysis and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE). Since its earliest application in the late 90′s, CGE has been increasingly used, with now more than 30 applications to events of various sizes including the Olympics, Rugby or Football World Cup and other smaller events. This accompanies the general diffusion of CGE models among policy advisors. In various countries, central or regional administrations increasingly use CGE models for evaluation purpose so that a significant body of modelling material is available to economists.====Focusing on the specific field of events, for a long time, these applications have not been subject to scrutiny. Only recently, Massiani (2018) provided a critical survey of existing applications and suggested that, in many cases, the quantitative results obtained tell more about the – sometimes implicit – assumptions of the model, than about the real economic phenomenon at stake. This results in large part of the transfer of modelling “habits” deeply rooted in the profession with too little consideration for the specificities of events as a particular object of analysis. Instead, proper economic evaluation should fully recognize that events differ, by many features, from more traditional topics of application of CGE such as international trade. Thus, the methodological focus should shift on specific issues like, for instance, the correct representation of substitution effects in consumers’ and government’s spending, or the adequate temporal framework to represent a phenomenon that has a peculiar time pattern. The analysis in Massiani (2018) partly covers this issue but it should be complemented with another, more detailed and applied investigation, that analyses, one-by-one, the main methodological issues and their possible solutions.====Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyse the most prominent issues in the CGE analysis of events and to propose possible modelling solutions with the benefit of increasing the reliability of CGE results and the policy recommendations that may result from them.====In the first section, we discuss the available studies and we examine the specificities of mega-events that justify a specific modelling approach.

By 2014, only three out of 200 did. Urbanization, steep economic growth, and policy reforms all played important roles in alleviating poverty in China (Qin et al., 2009). However, more than 70 million rural Chinese were still living below the nation's official poverty line, drawn at USD 2.3 per day, as of 2014 (Zhou et al., 2020). The remnant poverty, especially concentrated in rural areas, became an issue to be solved (Guo et al., 2019, Rogers, 2014). To address this, the Chinese government launched the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program in 2015—its goal was to lift every Chinese above the national poverty line by 2020 (Davie et al., 2021). This paper is devoted to analyzing the effects and heterogeneity of participation in the TPA program addressing poverty in rural China.====Since the reformation of the Land Administration System in 1978–79, China has implemented many economic and rural development initiatives: developing the Household Contract Responsibility System in 1983; establishing the Land Administration Bureau (LAB) in 1985; forming the State council Economic Development in Poor Areas Leading Group in 1986; advancing land markets in 1987; and launching the Seven-Year Priority Poverty Alleviation Program aimed at lifting 80 million Chinese out of poverty by 2000 (Qu et al., 1995, Zhang et al., 2021). The TPA program was launched based on these predecessors.====One of the novelties of the TPA program lies in delivering precisely targeted interventions. To this end, China's government established a database of surveys designed to track poor households. Local governments identified poor groups and registered them in the database (Zhou et al., 2018). For instance, specific households were paired with local government officials tasked with lifting the households out of poverty. This pairing mechanism was crucial to the program. It allowed impoverished households to become active participants in the initiatives designed to improve their welfare. However, the outcomes for different participants depended significantly on the resources available to the government officials assigned to them (Davie et al., 2021). Thus, differences in the outcomes across households were bound to arise—the existence of heterogeneities varying with county status and/or geographic locations.====Drawing poverty lines at specific income thresholds is desirable for measuring performance and evaluating outcomes. Be that as it may, excessive emphasis on these lines can distract one from consequential details. Consider one person who earns USD 2.31 per day and the other earning USD 2.29 per day. As per China's national poverty threshold, the first would not be deemed extremely poor, whereas the second would, even though their living standards are likely to be quite similar for all intents and purposes, ceteris paribus. Therefore, the important question is not whether one is above or below an income threshold but how much one earns. In other words, has the person's income risen markedly, allowing her to live a comfortable life and minimise risk (Li & Chavas, 2022) or has it increased just enough to push her over the income threshold while still leaving her destitute? This paper addresses this question.====Previous studies have looked into the different mechanisms through which the TPA program has affected socioeconomic outcomes (Guo et al., 2019), the effects of the TPA pairing system (Davie et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021), the impact of participation in the TPA program in subjective well-being (Tang et al., 2021), the role of land policy in the TPA program (Zhou et al., 2018), and the spatial distribution of rural poverty to inform the TPA program (Liu et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2018). According to Tang et al. (2021), TPA program participation does not contribute to subjective well-being. Although surprising, this result lends credence to our reasoning that merely moving above the poverty line does not necessitate higher living standards or instil a perception of well-being—how much progress one makes is of import.====Interventions that simultaneously address poverty and climate change have been examined with interest (Pal & Mitra, 2017). After all, China has also made great strides in transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources. In fact, the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in impoverished areas has been integral to a multipronged implementation of the TPA program (Geall et al., 2018). The government’s focus in this area has mainly been on research and innovation, infrastructure development, protection of intellectual property, and providing financial support; however, despite the emphasis, the policies lack structure, leading to sub-optimal outcomes of PV initiatives (Zhang, Xu, Sun et al., 2018). Similarly, Liao et al. (2020) note that the full developmental potential of PV programs is not being realized due to incoherent deployment strategies. Zhang et al. (2018) report that PV projects financed by the government and PV enterprises tend to be more effective in alleviating poverty than those funded entirely by the government or jointly by the government and households. Studies have also examined specific areas of the TAP program, such as poverty alleviation through labor transfer (Guo & Wang, 2021), the poverty alleviation resettlement policy (Yang et al., 2020), and the targeted poverty alleviation by tourism development (Liang & Bao, 2018).====Given the significance of the TPA program and how closely it is linked to households’ incomes and their overall living standards indicators, it is surprising that this question has been overlooked in the literature. Accordingly, the present paper bridges an important gap in the literature on one of the most significant anti-poverty programs of the last decade. We make three principal contributions. First, we estimate the impact of TPA program participation on multiple sources of household income and varieties of household expenditure, employing the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data for the period 2010–2018. Second, we employ the propensity score matching and difference-in-difference (PSM-DID) method to address selection bias arising from both observable and time-invariant unobservable factors. Third, by analyzing disaggregated data, we provide granular insights into the heterogeneous welfare effects of the TPA program; we show that the results depend on households’ location.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details the methodology used in this study. Data are discussed in Section 3. The empirical results are presented and discussed in Section 4.

The fruit safety regulations as ==== measures could be either trade-promoting or -impeding. The extensiveness and intensiveness of fruit safety regulations in these markets often have consequences for exporters from Africa and their desire to attain sustainable economic development. The effects of fruit safety regulations are heterogeneous across economic agents. To this end, many stakeholders in Africa’s food system have perceived compliance with these food regulatory measures as necessary conditions to access the developed countries’ markets, particularly in the EU and US. Besides, the competitiveness of Africa’s fruit exports has been impacted by the preponderance of the measures despite its comparative advantages in the fruits sub-sector. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of the EU and US sanitary and phytosanitary measures on Africa’s fruit exports. The empirical strategy involves the use of an augmented gravity model which explore the disentangling of these impact at the extensive and intensive margins of exports. Given the nature of trade data and specifically for this study, the zero trade flows are considered at both margins of exports for 45 African countries from 1995 to 2017. This study finds that the US market is more trade-impeding to Africa’s fruit exports than the EU market. Thus, Africa needs policies tweaking in the fruit value chain quality infrastructure, fruits’ quality and standards enforcement, capacity development, continuous update and modernisation of the fruits’ safety laws, directives and/or regulations. This will enhance the fruits’ quality to propel their access to the transatlantic markets.","Trade policy is one of the country’s macroeconomic policies that often reflect its economic, political and socio-cultural philosophy. Some countries, specifically in the transatlantic region, sometimes use trade policy as a soft power which they increasingly use to pursue their non-trade external policy goals (Bilal & Hoekman, 2019). Hence, this gave credence to the importance of trade policy in the context of global trade. Out of the trade policy measures, technical measures stand out as relatively more germane to market access, especially for Africa and other developing economies. Trade regulations are often applied in many countries across the globe for certain reasons; however, the extent of the regulations differs, especially between developed and developing countries. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) regulations, also called food safety regulations within which the fruit safety regulations (FSR) are a subset, allow countries to regulate the flow of unsafe food and feed to protect and safeguard humans, animals and plants' health as well as the environment. SPS regulations are entrenched in the SPS agreement, which is a part of the agreements within the purview of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that allows countries to control nutritional deficient, harmful and hazardous food commodities/products from gaining access to the countries’ markets. The SPS Agreement provides that countries should scientifically justify the imposition of SPS based on health hazards and environmental safety. Besides, its further states that the measures must be based on the WTO's most favoured nation’s (MFN) principle and must not be for national treatment purposes.====However, the pieces of evidence indicate that the FSR has been imposed by countries for different reasons in varying degrees of preponderance, which has consequences for trade. Compliance with FSR often involves production and processing facilities’ upgrading; human, management and institutional capacities improvement, which are huge costs oriented to the producers. The exporters from developing countries mostly felt the burden of the costs more than those from the advanced countries (Idsardi and Viviers, 2018, Kareem, 2016aaa, Kareem, 2016bbb, Moise and Le Bris, 2013) due to the differences in the developmental level. Based on this, Africa and other developing countries have been raising concerns about SPS incidences, particularly in the transatlantic region’s markets, to enhance exports. The technical measures are the most difficult non-tariff measures (NTM) to comply with (Fugazza, 2013). This corroborated some studies’ findings that SPS restricts Africa’s agri-food exports (Kareem et al., 2018, Kareem, 2016c, Otsuki et al., 2001). The trade-impeding impact of FSR could sometimes double that of tariffs (Moise and Le Bris, 2013, Mutume, 2006). Besides, other studies on Africa also find that the SPS measures in the developed countries' markets are trade-impeding – especially in the EU (Kareem et al., 2018, Kareem, 2016aaa, Kareem, 2016bbb, Okello and Roy, 2007, Otsuki et al., 2001, Shepherd and Wilson, 2013). The studies assert that the trade-restrictive impact of FSR has impacted the extent to which Africa can attain sustainable economic growth and development (Kareem, 2011, Kareem, 2016aaa, Mutume, 2006, Otsuki et al., 2001, Shepherd and Wilson, 2013, Wilson and Abiola, 2003). Another strand of scholars argues that FSR in these markets is influenced by consumers’ tastes and preferences that need to be protected from any quality deficiencies’ commodities. Their arguments were based on the fact that FSR might be trade-restrictive in the short term, however, the measures become market access-enhancing in the long-term after adequate compliance (Henson, 2006, Jaffee and Henson, 2004, Foletti and Shingal, 2014, Ferro et al., 2015).====The theoretical framework underpinning SPS/FSR asserts that the measures can either enhance and/or impede market access; the impact would depend on the aims of the trade policy in the country and capacity and the capability of exporting countries to produce quality fruits. The concerns about FSR compliance are raised by Africa and other developing countries but there are also situations where trade concerns have been raised by developed countries. In the trade relations between Africa and the European Union (EU) and Africa and the United States (US), the issue of the agri-food impact of FSR has continued to be topical, particularly for fruit commodities. The EU and the US are Africa’s traditional trade partners and largest importers of Africa’s agricultural commodities, despite the recent redirection of Africa’s trade towards China. The increment in the incidences of FSR in the transatlantic region has consequences for fruit exports from Africa and its quest for inclusive and sustainable development. To this end, this study investigates the fruits exports effect of the fruit safety regulations in the EU and the US – the transatlantic region. The empirical strategy for this study adopts a theoretical framework from Helpman, Melitz and Rubenstein (HMR) (2008) and employs the selection model for the period from 1995 to 2017. The commodity selection cut across aggregated and disaggregated fruit commodities at the HS 2-digit and HS 6-digit commodity classification.====This study is motivated by the fact that there are scanty empirical studies on the issue of FSR in the transatlantic region, particularly studies that have investigated the trade relations as conceptualized in this study, despite the relevance of FSR to Africa’s access to the markets. This implies that evidence- and research-oriented policy decisions concerning the pathways and the extent of the impact of FSR would not be scientifically made, thereby inhibiting the pragmatic ways to overcome these market access challenges. Also, this might impact the extent to which Africa can adequately negotiate trade arrangements/agreements, especially in the future post-Cotonou partnership agreement and the economic partnership agreements (EPA). Kareem (2014, 2016c) and Shepherd and Wilson (2013) affirm the dearth of empirical literature in this area.====Furthermore, the existing few studies on Africa concentrated mostly on Eastern African exporters (see Asfaw et al., 2007; Rio et al., 2009) except Henson and Jaffee (2008), Henson and Humphrey (2009), Kareem et al., 2017, Kareem et al., 2018, Kareem, 2014a, Kareem, 2016aaa, Kareem, 2016c. More so, virtually all these studies focus on the EU market without considering the US market which is important for Africa. To this end, given the dearth of literature, particularly on Africa’s fruit export effects of the US FSR, this study contributes to the frontier of knowledge by investigating the effects of transatlantic region FSR on Africa, especially for the US FSR. Besides, studies in this area often use aggregated agri-food trade data, especially in the horticultural sector. Although the agri-food aggregated trade data are necessary for the understanding of the issue, it is at the disaggregated commodity level that the actual trade takes place and policy decisions are needed. This informs the contribution of this study with the use of the disaggregated fruit exports data for Africa which is yet to be explored in this trade relations. Studied such as Kareem and Rau (2018), Kareem (2019), Rio et al. (2009), Ferro et al. (2013), Kareem (2016d, 2014a), Henson and Jaffee (2008), Kareem et al., 2017, Kareem et al., 2018 have used some disaggregated agri-food trade data in the empirical analyses, however, their studies were not in the context of the transatlantic region and Africa trade relations. Also, the data points – the period of coverage – of previous studies have been substantially extended in this study. More so, the policy implications of this transatlantic region's technical measures, FSR, are still an issue for empirical investigation, which is explored in this study.

Contrary, the probability to export bananas to the EU is not adversely impacted by the FSR but the reverse is the case in the US. At the intensive margin of export, the fruit safety regulations are trade-enhancing to Africa’s fruit and banana exports in the EU market, however, in the US market, they are trade-impeding. Therefore, it becomes essential for Africa to tweak its policies on fruit value chain-oriented quality infrastructure, fruits’ quality and standards enforcement, science and technology development, capacity development, continuous update and modernisation of the fruits’ safety laws, directives and/or regulations. This will propel technology adoption, enhance the fruits’ quality and ensure economies of scale and size in the fruit subsector to improve the commodity’s competitiveness and propel their access to the transatlantic markets.",Fruit safety regulations in the transatlantic region: How are Africa’s exports faring with the regulations?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000552,9 September 2022,2022,Research Article,48.0

The activity of prefectorial officials is compared with the activity of elected mayors exploiting data extracted from a panel of 7826 Italian municipalities from 2007 to 2018. To address the potential confounding effects and selection biases, we combine a ==== strategy with machine learning methods for counterfactual analysis. Results show that non-political administrators bring higher financial autonomy and higher collection capacity, raising more revenues at local level. This is consistent with the hypothesis that, since they do not respond to electoral incentives, non-political administrators have lower motivations to behave strategically, not taking their own interests about electoral successes into account when they must choose the proportion of local versus external revenues for financing local expenditure.","One of the key elements of the recent public sector reforms has been the transfer of decision-making powers to local (sub-national) governments (Hansjörg & Junghun, 2016). Decentralization has been considered one of the solutions for different problems, such as stimulating economic growth and reducing rural poverty, strengthening civil society, and deepening democracy (Manor, 1999). For decentralization enthusiasts, decentralization improves local public service delivery by making local officials more responsive to the voter–taxpayers’ demands, as public action is closer to the citizen (De Vries, 2000). With these arguments, between 70 % and 80 % of both developing and developed countries around the globe have been undergoing some devolution of powers to sub-national governments over the last decades (Garman et al., 2001, Hooghe et al., 2010). The transfer of decision-making powers to sub-national governments is a multifaceted phenomenon encompassing political, administrative, and fiscal dimensions. In this regard, three main categories have been identified: 1. Policy decentralization, which involves transferring policy decisions to lower levels of government; 2. Political decentralization, which engages the process by which the local officials assume their offices; and 3. Fiscal decentralization, which consists of the transfer of expenditure and revenue power (Rodden, 2004).====As the autonomy of local governments depends to a large extent on the adequacy of the resources to carry out their functions, and the discretion in the allocation decisions, the financial aspects are very significant. In this sense, the test of decentralization for local governments lies in their ability to finance their own expenditures from their own taxes without having to depend on the central government. Financial autonomy empowers local administrators since any intervention must be financed by their own citizens, through local taxes. Currently, no country has such financial self-sufficiency: i.e., local governments' expenditures are systematically higher than their revenues, and the difference is provided by the central government through transfers, whether for reasons of equalization or for financial control (Bobbio, 2015). This condition of dependence on the central government is generally accepted by local governments because it allows them to spend without having to impose taxes on their citizens. However, the principle of “representation without taxation” has the effect to take responsibility away from local administrators who can go wide in their spending while relying on the contributions from the central state (Brosio & Piperno, 2013).====In this regard, there are specific reasons why a political official may act differently from a non-political official. The Downs (1957) model and the seminal work of Nordhaus (1975) put forward the idea that politicians may be driven by private interests and, differently from non-politicians, may care about their reelection prospects. As the economic conditions influence election results (Fair et al., 1975, Kramer, 1971), a politician who wants to be reelected has an incentive to manipulate the economy to gain votes. The most clear and immediate instruments involved in this manipulation are benefits to voters which imply modifications to the public budget.====The existence of political budget cycles (cycle in macroeconomic variables induced by the electoral cycle) has been widely documented in both central and local governments (Alesina and Passalacqua, 2016, Alesina et al., 1997, Cioffi et al., 2012, Drazen, 2000). Several studies so far have been focused on empirically testing the hypothesis of political budget cycle in Latin America (Ames, 1990, Neto and Borsani, 2004, Nieto Parra and Santiso, 2009, Remmer, 1993), Africa (Block, 2002), East Europe (Haller- berg et al., 2002), and industrial democracies (Alesina et al., 1997, Klomp and De Haan, 2011, Klomp and De Haan, 2013, Mink and De Haan, 2006). Overall, these studies suggest that the occurrence of political business cycles depends on different factors such as the level of development and democracy, government transparency, the country’s political system, membership of a monetary union, and the degree of political polarization.====At central level, the government can pursue an expansive budgetary policy while temporarily hiding the harmful consequences from the agents by means of a budget deficit. The government creates the illusion of prosperity until the time when voters realize that they will have to reimburse the deficit thus caused. Even supposing that voters are rational, they don’t have complete information about the government’s capacity to efficiently provide public goods and transfers, so that the government leverages the informational advantage that it has over voters (Alesina, 1988, Persson and Tabellini, 2002).====At local level, there is an additional source of financing worthy of attention which is a grant from the central government, i.e., intergovernmental transfers (Gilbert & Rocaboy, 2004). Intergovernmental transfers are financed by broad-based taxation but generate local benefits (Veiga & Veiga, 2013). The presence of transfers from central government is justified by the fact that central government addresses territorial redistribution and insures local governments against shocks (Boadway, 2004, Lockwood, 1999, Persson and Tabellini, 1994). However, it has been shown that a large share of intergovernmental transfers undermines the autonomy and accountability of decentralized decision-making, and it generates fiscal illusion, a phenomenon which arises when the link between taxes and benefits is distorted and voters are less likely to sanction inefficient behaviors of politicians (Bird, 1999, Oates, 1993, Rodden, 2004). Several studies have shown that local politicians make a strategic use of intergovernmental grants, taking their own interests about electoral successes into account when they must choose the proportion of local revenues versus central transfers for the financing of local expenditure (Alesina et al., 2019, Bracco et al., 2015, Brollo and Nannicini, 2012, Brollo et al., 2013, Lopez-Valcarcel et al., 2017). These phenomena may represent a serious problem for the economic systems as the electoral motivations in intergovernmental transfers generate welfare losses, excessive government spending, and inequities (Boadway & Shah, 2007).====A political use of intergovernmental transfers has been widely documented in municipalities (Bee & Moulton, 2015). Sol´e-Oll´e and Sorribas-Navarro (2008) suggest that partisan alignment has a positive effect on the amount of grants received by municipalities in Spain. Brollo and Nannicini (2012) find that municipalities in which the mayor is affiliated with the party of the central president receive larger discretionary transfers in Brazil. Veiga and Veiga (2013) find that the distribution of transfers is affected by the political cycle in Portugal. Herwartz and Theilen (2014) find a role for political affiliation of the state governor in determining the distribution of transfers in Germany. Bracco et al. (2015) find that municipalities ruled by a mayor affiliated to one of the parties in power at the central level receive a larger amount of grants in Italy. Carozzi and Repetto (2016) have proven that the municipal governments of parliament members’ birth towns receive larger transfers in Italy. Murak¨ozy and Telegdy (2016) find that municipalities with a mayor endorsed by the governing coalition take higher grants for projects visible to voters in Hungary. Chortareas et al. (2016) find strong evidence of pre-electoral budget manipulation in Greek municipal- ities. Alesina et al. (2019) find that political budget cycles in Italian municipalities are more likely to occur when the career concerns of local politicians are stronger.====This paper contributes to this literature by empirically testing the difference in the financial management between political and non-political officials in local governments. We focus on the Italian case by comparing municipalities administrated by commissioners (officials of the prefectorial career nominated by higher level of government) with municipalities administrated by political mayors. The Italian municipalities are worthy of attention, as they show a large heterogeneity in private sector, revenues from taxation and public expenditure, partly explained by the unresolved social-economic dualism between northern and southern regions, partly by the presence of large fiscal imbalances among the different level of governments (De Simone and Liberati, 2020, Greco et al., 2018, Lagravinese et al., 2018, Porcelli, 2014). Furthermore, the Italian case provides an interesting case study as several fiscal reforms introduced higher decentralization of revenue and expenditure responsibilities with the aim to increase the autonomy of sub-national levels of governments, including municipalities (Bracco et al., 2015, Bracco et al., 2019).====From an empirical perspective, we implement a Differences-in-Differences (DiD) design on a panel of 7826 municipalities monitored yearly from 2007 to 2018. To address the selection bias due to the intrinsic differentiation between municipalities administered by commissioners and municipalities administered by elected mayors, we resort to machine learning methods in the building of the counterfactual scenario. To generate the artificial control group, we predict the commissioner in municipalities using a set of institutional, demographics and geographical data observed the year before the commissioner is in charge by means of the Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). Once the predictions have been validated out of the sample, only municipalities with the same predicted commissioner are considered in the DiD estimates. Results show that non-political administrators are associated with higher financial autonomy which implies less external financing. Non-political administrators also show higher collection capacity which expresses the institution’s ability to collect their revenue forecast earlier in the year. Overall, this evidence shows that non-political administrators take more revenues locally, and this is consistent with their lower incentives to behave strategically in response to an electoral stimulus.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

We estimate that the Western and U.S. sanctions against Russia spilled over into third-party small countries. These sanctions resulted in the significant decline of exports from transition economies, Russian imports to transition economies, and Russian direct investments to transition economies. Interestingly, the direct investments to Russia from transition economies sharply increased during the same period. The quantitative estimates of the spillovers suggest the following cumulative changes. Due to an imposed sanction type (e.g., against an individual, entity or sector) each episode of Western/U.S. sanction resulted in the decline of aforementioned indicators in the range of 10.9–30.5-million-dollar/5.6–16.9-million-dollar of exports from transition economies, 6.3–17.7-million-dollar/3.3–9.8-million-dollar of Russian imports to transition economies, and 3.4–9.4-million-dollar/1.7–5.2-million-dollar of Russian direct investments to transition economies. The direct investments to Russia from transition economies increased by 10.9–30.6-million-dollar/5.7–17-million-dollar, respectively.","The motivation for this paper is to study whether sanctions imposed against a large open economy can produce spillovers into third-party small countries of the same region. We are using the case of Western sanctions against the Russian Federation during 2014–2018 and analyze their impact on bilateral economic activities, which include trade and foreign investments between Russia and transition economies (TE). Here, the focus is on the twenty-seven countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU), and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) (Gevorkyan, 2018).====During last decades, various episodes of severe political struggles between foreign powers were resolved by imposing economic sanctions. From the general policy perspective, economic sanctions have been contemplated as more practicable than engagement in military conflicts, as they usually avoid the devastation caused by wars and preserve human lives (Neuenkirch and Neumier, 2016). Since 1960 s scholars studied the episodes of sanctions and the causes for imposing them (Daoudi and Dajani, 1983, Galtung, 1967, Hoffmann, 1967, Lindsay, 1986, Wallensteen, 1968). Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, and Oegg (1990) paper introduced the first comprehensive dataset of sanctions, also known as the HSE dataset, enabling a more systemized approach to the studies of their economic effects from 1914 to 2000. Later, Morgan, Bapat, and Krustev (2009) in the Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions (TIES) dataset added travel disputes and travel bans during 1945–2005. Then, Biersteker, Eckert, Tourinho, and Hudáková (2018) in the Targeted Sanctions Consortium (TSC) quantitative and qualitative dataset compiled all episodes of UN sanctions in 1991–2013. Despite the comprehensive nature of these datasets, the criteria defining success of sanctions significantly differ (Biersteker et al., 2018). Therefore, the consensus that sanctions achieve successful policy outcomes is frequently challenged in scholarly debates.====Notwithstanding the wide use of sanctions, the general debate about their economic impact is still controversial. On the one hand, a volume of research views sanctions as a tool of political gains and emphasizes their symbolic effect. These scholars estimate that sanctions do not produce the desired democratic outcomes in target countries in about 65–95% of all studied cases (Baldwin and Pape, 1998, Hufbauer et al., 2009, Neuenkirch and Neumeier, 2016, Pape, 1997, Whang, 2011). On the other hand, a growing number of researchers agree that the Western sanctions against Russia contributed to this country’s economic decline of 2014. Thus, a group of authors estimated a short-term negative shock from these sanctions resulting in significant contraction of Russia’s GDP (Gurvich and Prilepskiy, 2015, Tuzova and Qayum, 2016). There is a disagreement over the estimates on economic contraction. Thus, Tuzova and Qayum (2016) offer a more pessimistic view and assess the fall of quarterly economic activities by 19%. An IMF report (2015 a.) estimates a more modest economic decline of 1–1.9% annually. These two studies reach agreement about the possibilities of more severe economic consequences of sanctions in the medium-term forecast.====Our study goes one step further and focuses on the spillovers of sanctions into third-party countries. We focus on transition economies, which due to their geographic location, shared history, and cultural understanding have developed strong economic ties with the target state, Russia. In macroeconomic terms, this is an attempt to evaluate the medium-term spillovers of sanctions into small open economies that could arise in the aftermath of tensions between large open economies, i.e., the United States, the West and the Russian Federation.====Since the data on Western sanctions against Russia of 2014–2018 were not available in the literature, we construct a new dataset and assign quantitative value to each episode of sanctions. This analysis assesses the level of spillovers into transition economies generated by multilateral and unilateral sanctions. The multilateral sanctions are imposed by Western economies including the U.S. (hereinafter, West). The unilateral sanctions are imposed only by the U.S.====Two gravity models- bilateral trade and bilateral investment flows- are constructed to conduct analysis. The Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) econometric tool is used to analyze the data.====The novelty of this study is twofold. First, we construct a dataset which provides quantitative estimate for each episode of imposed Western and U.S. economic sanctions against Russia from March, 2014–2018. Second, this newly developed dataset is used to measure medium-term spillovers of the sanctions against Russia into transition economies with sanctions modeled as an independent variable. We find that Western and U.S. sanctions against Russia produced significant spillovers in terms of reduced bilateral trade between Russia and transition economies and direct investments from Russia to transition economies. We also find that direct investments from transition economies to Russia significantly increased during the same period.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

Using a 2SLS panel regression model, we find an important role of incomes, relative food prices, household characteristics, as well as mobility restrictions in response to the rising number of infections in a given region in explaining varying food expenditure shares prior to and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The disproportionate burden of the pandemic induced lockdowns on the disadvantaged and minorities calls for effective action on the part of policymakers to boost aggregate demand, fix supply chains and reduce food price volatility.","Globally, the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet rose from 112 million in 2019–3.1 billion in 2020 (====). This reflects the massive impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated containment measures adopted by governments on global food security and nutrition. Food Security can be seen as economic access to food (which is a function of income generation and food prices), availability (which is a function of robust food supply systems), utilization (which is a function of food composition and nutrient content) and stability of these three dimensions over time. Disruptions to the food systems due to the pandemic relate to both the supply side (food production, processing and distribution) and demand side (economic and physical access to food). Restrictions on movement due to policies to contain the spread of the coronavirus have had an impact in the form of disrupted value chains, and particularly in informal markets, but the impact on prices depends on the resilience of the value chains (====, ====). Despite the success of the food supply system as measured by its capacity to adapt to challenges such as COVID-19 or provide a variety of food at relatively low prices, the increased household food security can be explained by the loss of incomes and employment (====).====In India, the nationwide lockdowns and the associated economic downturns, combined with suspension of school nutrition programmes, may have worsened the food security status of several adults and children. Our present study analyses food demand among households in India prior to and during the Covid-19 pandemic, based on nationally representative household consumption and expenditure survey data. The extent to which households allocate their income between food and non-food items, depends on household location, market prices, and income opportunities (====, ====). In the present study, we examine the shifts in Food Engel Curves in India during the period January 2019 to August 2021, and offer plausible explanations for varying degrees of shifts and their policy implications.====To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study examining the impact of the pandemic induced economic stressors such as declining incomes and rising prices on food expenditure shares using a nationally representative dataset.

The more generous and broader the coverage is, the costlier the policies. The first-best policy is the universal basic income, which can eradicate extreme poverty at the cost of 10.61 % of the gross domestic product. The least effective policy transfers only to older people.","A fundamental objective over time has been to eradicate extreme poverty. It is the first of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The challenge is to achieve this objective with a social policy based on conditional transfers. A less common social policy is to grant unconditional transfers. The Universal Basic Income (UBI) is an unconditional minimum monetary transfer granted to all individuals in a population. Universality provides the freedom to decide what and where to buy, and it promotes a more integrated society with a higher sense of community, which may lead to social justice (Sen, 2009).====The objective of this paper is to provide evidence of the effectiveness of social policy to alleviate poverty. To carry out the analysis, we base the analysis on the MEXMOD tax-benefit microsimulation model for Mexico developed under the EUROMOD framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a simulated impact of UBI has been applied as an example of a long-term policy with conditional and unconditional cash transfers focused on the poor in a country with a high proportion of people in poverty and with a social policy mainly based on conditional transfers.====UBI is desirable under a social protection system with low coverage and low progressivity, where targeting difficulties, implementation bottlenecks, and resource constraints exist (Francese & Prady, 2018, p. 12, Fig. 6). One example of a UBI is the pension program for the older population. In Mexico, it started in 2007; initially, it was granted to people older than 65 years whose incomes were below a poverty cutoff. With a new federal government's arrival in 2019, the older pension program became universal, without conditioning on a low income (Gobierno de Mexico, 2021).====Conditional transfers have been the basis of social policy. However, problems arise when trying to find the eligible population among a dispersed population. The drawbacks of UBI are that the benefits are targeted to all populations, reducing inequality but raising questions about progressivity. Our contribution to the literature is to quantify different designs of this social policy and evaluate poverty reduction after hypothetically implementing conditional and unconditional transfers. Policy recommendations are the need to look for alternatives to make a better use of public resources to be more effective in reducing poverty. Our point is not to convince policymakers to implement UBI but to start an academic discussion of how to simplify social policy to maximize the coverage of the most vulnerable populations.====The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 1.1 explains the current poverty situation of Mexico and the social policies implemented; Section 1.2 discusses UBI definitions and estimated costs; Section 2 explains the assumptions to design UBI transfers; Section 3 describes the methodology and data used for the microsimulations; Section 4 provides the results of the microsimulations of UBI under four scenarios of conditional and unconditional criteria; and Section 5 shows the cost of each scenario of transfers and the distributional effects.

Since solvency is a rather complex concept and its governance is difficult and delicate, the paper maintains that such countries could try to achieve the sustainability of public debt by delegating the tasks of securing the observance of solvency and liquidity conditions to fiscal councils (FC) that need to be formed as autonomous public institutions with sufficient financial and technical resources. In Turkey FC needs to be assigned the further task of improving policymakers’ incentives to opt for sound government procurement and taxation policies that would lead to the achievement of efficient allocation of resources and elimination of ==== and nepotism in the economy.","A key issue confronting the Turkish economy concerns the achievement and maintenance of public debt sustainability over time. After reviewing the economic principles and statistical methods for assessing public debt sustainability, the paper applies these principles and methods to the case of Turkey. The paper argues that the attainment and maintenance of public debt sustainability is challenging and that it is not a choice. A country whose government fails to respect public debt sustainability must eventually either default on its debt or resort to monetary financing that results in inflation.====A vast literature on public debt sustainability revolves around mainly two approaches: empirical analysis using unit root and cointegration techniques and the standard approach to public debt sustainability analysis.====In empirical analysis using unit root and cointegration techniques fiscal policy is said to be sustainable as long as the present value of public debt asymptotically converges to zero (transversality condition) and/or the present value of future primary balances equals or exceeds the initial value of public debt (intertemporal budget constraint). The challenge in those studies is to devise and implement empirical tests of the transversality condition or of the intertemporal budget constraint. An early contribution to this literature was made, as emphasized in Section 3, by Hamilton and Flavin (1986), who investigated whether the US historical data provide a basis for expecting a violation of the intertemporal budget constraint, and assuming a fixed real interest rate to prevail over time. The authors using unit root tests concluded that US fiscal policy was sustainable. Wilcox (1989) concentrating on transversality condition focused on the role of the interest rate to be resorted to in order to discount the stream of public debt. In contrast to Hamilton and Flavin’s (1986) result, Wilcox (1989), by allowing for stochastic real interest rates, found that the US fiscal policy was not sustainable. Trehan and Walsh (1988) showed that if real revenue, real spending, and real debt have unit roots, stationarity of budget deficit is sufficient for intertemporal budget constraint and transversality condition to hold. On the other hand, Trehan and Walsh (1991) showed that intertemporal budget constraint can be satisfied by estimating a vector error correction model that includes the budget deficit (inclusive of interest expense) as the error correction term. Furthermore, Hakkio and Rush (1991), in a study on the relationship between government spending and revenues, showed that the variables are cointegrated for the entire sample period but that the estimated cointegration factor is significantly less than unity indicating that fiscal policy violates the present value borrowing constraint.====In another strand of literature, Bohn (1998) proposed a different test on sustainability. According to Bohn public debt is sustainable if the primary balance–GDP ratio is a positive function of the public debt–GDP ratio, and the reaction coefficient determining how strongly the primary balance reacts to rises in public debt is statistically significant. According to Bohn (1998), a positive response shows that the government is taking actions by reducing noninterest outlays or raising revenues that counteract the changes in debt, and that an estimated positive response of primary balance-to-GDP ratio to public debt-to-GDP ratio can be interpreted as a new test for the sustainability of fiscal policy. More recently, Ghosh et al. (2013) used non-linear fiscal reaction functions for the estimation of public debt sustainability thresholds and public debt limits aimed at providing measures of fiscal space, defined as the distance between the current debt level and debt limit, beyond which fiscal solvency is in doubt. Finally, Checherita-Westphal and Zdarek (2017) analyzed whether fiscal responsiveness has changed over time, and they proposed to use fiscal reaction functions to derive primary balance benchmarks used to identify fiscal fatigue risks.====On the other hand, the standard approach to public debt sustainability analysis, used by Buiter (1985) and Blanchard (1990), has formed the basis of public debt sustainability assessment framework developed by the International Monetary Fund, 2002, International Monetary Fund, 2013 and Celasun et al. (2006). This framework has been used extensively in IMF debt sustainability assessments for IMF program designs and reviews as well as Article IV surveillances. The approach has been critical for the exercise of IMF's core functions of surveillance and lending.====There is a growing literature on empirical evidence regarding the sustainability of Turkish public debt. Most of these studies utilize unit root tests on primary balances and public debt, and cointegration tests for government revenue and expenditure. The empirical studies on sustainability of Turkish public debt provide mixed results. While authors such as Akçay et al. (2002) and Kia (2008) find that the Turkish public debt is not sustainable, Kalyoncu (2005) and Uçal and Alıcı (2010) find a weak form of sustainability. On the other hand, Celasun et al. (2006) assert that Turkey’s public debt dynamics look unmanageable under most circumstances, and using fan charts the authors show that distribution of debt-to-GDP ratios is skewed towards the upside, and that sustaining high primary surpluses is key to containing the risks to debt sustainability. Similarly Tanner and Samake (2008) find that fiscal policy is sustainable as long as primary surplus-to-GDP ratio does not fall below 6.5 percent. Finally, Budina and van Wijnbergen (2008) assert that fiscal policy with primary surpluses of 6 percent of GDP is sustainable, otherwise debt is not sustainable.====In this paper, we employ an empirical analysis using unit root and cointegration techniques as well as the standard approach to public debt sustainability analysis that relies on the theoretical framework presented in 2 Public debt sustainability, 3 Empirical analysis of public debt sustainability: unit roots, cointegration and Bohn’s framework, 4 Standard approach to public debt sustainability analysis. The purpose of our analyses is to compare the two approaches and identify appropriate policies and institutional arrangements required for the achievement of public debt sustainability. We show that Turkish public debt according to Bohn’s (2005) fiscal sustainability test is sustainable, but not sustainable according to most versions of the standard approach.====The paper maintains that the standard approach to public debt sustainability analysis is superior to Bohn’s fiscal sustainability test mainly because of the following reasons. The standard approach to public debt sustainability analysis is explicit about the time dependence of the sustainability problem over the medium as well as the long term whereas Bohn’s fiscal sustainability test is not. The ‘solvency’ requirement in the standard approach is forward-looking, and the standard approach can evaluate the various risks with respect to debt dynamics.==== An additional advantage of the standard approach is the possibility to employ the stochastic simulation framework which generates frequency distributions of the public debt-to-GDP ratio for each year of a projection period enabling probabilistic assessment of public debt sustainability. Finally, Bohn’s approach does not provide relevant guidance in policy formulation in the uncertain future whereas the standard approach to public debt sustainability analysis does.====The paper also asserts that sustainability of public debt is rather complex and difficult to manage. Achieving public debt sustainability requires short-term fiscal adjustments that includes budget revenue measures and rationalizing public expenditures for macroeconomic stabilization. However, we maintain that while these short-term measures are necessary, they are not sufficient to guarantee medium to long-term attainment of public debt sustainability. Therefore, we make a distinction between short-term fiscal adjustments and institutional arrangements that are needed in order to guarantee public debt sustainability in the long-term. We propose that, in addition to fiscal adjustments, the sustainability of public debt could be achieved by assigning the task of designing sound economic policies and evaluating the impact of government policies to an autonomous public institution, the Fiscal Council (FC), that needs to be established with sufficient financial and technical resources to carry out the tasks assigned to it.====The paper is structured as follows. While Section 2 analyses the concept of public debt sustainability in general terms, Section 3 discusses the empirical analysis on public debt sustainability concentrating on unit roots, cointegration and Bohn’s debt sustainability framework. Section 4 concentrates on the methodology and assessment of public debt sustainability analysis under the standard approach. Section 5 discusses public debt governance issues in Turkey.

My study uncovers evidence of a COVID-19 induced decline in asset utilization. Findings advocate sharing economy as a potential tool to banks in combating any future pandemic risk with regionalized approach to supervision being deemed better than its globalized counterpart.","Though the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 represented a global pandemic on 11th March 2020, nonetheless, the world is still reeling from its aftermath with the economic implications being coined as ‘Coronanomics’ by Eichengreen (2020).==== The effects of COVID-19 overshadowed those which emanated from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–08. This concern is echoed in the $2.2 trillion bailout package which was launched in the US during the pandemic compared to the $750 billion package provided during the GFC. As the global economy steered through unchartered waters, banks underwent pressures as they grappled with unprecedented challenges. COVID-19 brought about both positive and negative impacts on banks worldwide. On a positive note, COVID-19 generated a hike in trading revenues occasioned by coronavirus-related volatility. On a negative note, the financial intermediation role of banks got a real blow. Quitzow et al. (2021) conclude that COVID-19 accentuated the gap between leaders and laggards of the worldwide energy transition as to menace the attainment of the global climate targets. Moreover, banks were compelled to cancel any share buyback programmes, to cap their dividends and to cut jobs to survive such as in the case of the UK lender NatWest.====My paper analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 on the determinants of bank profitability for Top Banks in the world by addressing the following key issue or question: Does proximity matters in bank profitability at the global and sub-global levels, controlling for distance levels, COVID-19 and profitability metrics?

This stands in contrast to the global recession following the global financial crisis. Should downside risks to the global recovery, in particular financial market stress, materialize, they are likely to set back growth in EMDEs more than in advanced economies in part because of the more limited policy space remaining in EMDEs, and would further widen per capita income divergence.","The recovery from the deep global recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has been highly uneven across countries, leaving behind some of the poorest countries. Whereas advanced economies are recovering at a robust pace, and are expected to all regain their pre-pandemic real per capita income levels in 2023, almost two-fifths of emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) are not expected to recover their pre-pandemic real per capita income levels by that time (====).====This recovery is so uneven that it ends a multi-decade trend of per capita income convergence. This compounds the increase in within-country income inequality in EMDEs, where lower-income population groups have faced disproportionate income, job, and learning losses (====).====To the extent that the next three years usher in a longer-term return to per capita income divergence among poorer and richer countries, it raises concerns about the world’s ability to achieve development goals. Conceptually, as implied by the ==== growth model, poor countries are expected to grow faster than rich ones because of higher returns to (scarcer) capital. Empirical support for this hypothesis has been mixed. In fact, early empirical works, such as ==== and ====, reported divergence in incomes between rich and poor countries. This lack of evidence for absolute convergence has led to the development of alternative hypotheses, including conditional convergence (====), club convergence (====), and the middle-income trap (====, ====). In a comprehensive recent review of the literature, ==== conclude that over the whole of 1960–2010, there is limited evidence supporting absolute convergence.====Toward the end of this broad time span, however, others have identified periods of per capita income convergence. ==== and ==== document evidence of convergence—albeit at a modest pace and in part driven by a slowdown among richer countries—from the mid-1990s and especially during the 2000s.====Does the pandemic now mark another turning point for global per capita income convergence? We take on this question from three angles. First, we examine the implications of the current global growth outlook for income convergence. Second, we examine how these implications compare with previous global recessions. Third, we explore the reasons for the post-pandemic per capita income divergence.====To date, the question of the pandemic’s impact on per capita income convergence has not been addressed empirically, except in ====We document several findings. First, the lagging recovery in EMDEs compared with advanced economies will turn a multi-decade trend of per capita income convergence before the pandemic into a period of per capita income divergence over 2021–23.====Second, should one of the many risks to global growth materialize, EMDEs have limited policy room to respond, in contrast with advanced economies. As a result, the risk scenarios explored here—especially financial market stress—would hurt lower-income economies disproportionately, which would further widen post-pandemic per capita income divergence.====Third, per capita income divergence in the recovery from the global recession of 2020 contrasts with the accelerated convergence in the recovery from the global recession of 2009 (after the global financial crisis). To a considerable degree, per capita income divergence reflects smaller policy stimulus in EMDEs than in advanced economies, larger informal sectors that were hard hit by the pandemic, lesser ability to harness digital technologies, and slower progress in vaccination.====This paper relies on GDP growth and population data from the World Bank’s ==== and ==== for up to 182 EMDEs and 36 advanced economies for 1965–2023. The projections for 2021–23 are drawn from the January 2022 edition of the ==== report (====). Real GDP levels use 2017 PPP weights (from the ====’s ====). The terms ==== and ==== are used interchangeably to simplify the discussion. The risk scenarios are modelled using the Oxford Economics Model as described in greater detail in ====.====Specifically, we look at three aspects of convergence. First, we compare the evolution of average per capita income growth in advanced economies and EMDEs. Second, we examine changes in the between-country ==== of real per capita GDP. This measure is intended to offer a more granular view of the dispersion of per capita income than the two broad country groups, and notably captures changes in the global per capita income distribution around its mode—that is, among middle-income countries. Third, we estimate the pace of unconditional convergence in a cross-country ordinary-least-squares regression of average annual per capita real GDP growth on initial per capita incomes.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== illustrates the implications of global growth prospects for per capita income convergence in EMDEs. ==== develops two downside risk scenarios and quantifies their implications for global per capita income convergence. ==== documents how per capita income convergence evolved around past global recessions. ==== explores the reasons for the disproportionate damage of the pandemic to EMDEs. ==== concludes.",Another legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic: Income divergence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000680,July–August 2022,2022,Research Article,56.0

At the root of the debate is the fundamental question of what incentivizes a sovereign has to repay its debts; without answering this question, it is difficult to appraise policy options. The tension between developing a realistic model of sovereign debt and having an elegant self-contained ==== ==== are familiar from corporate finance. The ==== approach has important philosophical implications, but the more targeted corporate-finance-like approach is needed for most practical problems that policymakers face.","This paper explores a fundamental academic debate on the core reasons sovereign countries are willing to honor debts to foreign creditors and argues that a bargaining/legal approach is likely far more useful for policy analysis than the philosophically powerful but empirically less relevant reputation approach. Whereas the debate may be academic, there are important consequences in weighing alternative approaches to improving the global system for dealing with sovereign debt crises.====As of this writing, the world is grinding through the third year of the COVID pandemic. One of the most pressing issues is how to deal with the huge debts that developing economies and emerging markets have taken on to help keep their economies afloat. Although their debt explosion is not nearly as massive as for advanced economies, the risks of debt distress are significant, particularly for low-income economies and lower middle income emerging markets (“frontier economies”); the risks are also palpable in some of the major emerging markets particularly if global interest rates rise significantly (say because inflation in the US and Europe is not so easily tamed), and if there is significant commodity price weakness (say, if China’s were to experience a significant slowdown.) (See Kose et. al, 2022).====Why are risks elevated? Overall levels of government debt in emerging markets and developing economies are at record highs; governments also have significant “hidden debts” in the form of record high private borrowing from abroad (of which a large percentage is in foreign currency) Moreover, if post-covid banking fragilities prove even more severe than anticipated bank bailouts will add to the pain. Banking crises hit hard at public finances in emerging markets, which did not implement the same degree of regulatory reforms as advanced economies after the 2008–2009 crisis, leaving their banking systems more vulnerable (Rogoff, 2022). Moreover, many emerging market and developing economies have adopted many of the same kind of policies as advanced economies that could strain the financial system, including extended mortgage and rent moratoria.====Recognizing that there are sizable risks, there is now an active discussion about what might be done, including renewed interest in having an international sovereign debt bankruptcy system (Krueger, 2002) or other forms of multilateral intervention (Rogoff & Zettelmeyer, 2002). See IMF (2021). There is also intense discussion of how to extend the G20 Debt Servicing Suspension Initiative (which covers most debts to official creditors) to incorporate debt owed to private creditors as well. Some proposed broad-sweeping debt write-downs (Reinhart & Rogoff, 2020), while others have suggested innovative legal strategies (Bolton et al., 2020).====Not surprisingly, simultaneously, there is a new wave of academic research on sovereign debt, for example, as surveyed in Mitchener and Trebesch (2022).",Issues in the theory of sovereign debt and post-covid workouts,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000618,July–August 2022,2022,Research Article,57.0

In response to accelerating inflation, the Federal Reserve moved in March to raise interest rates, and plans for six more rate hikes this year, in the hope that it can achieve a soft landing without pushing the US economy into a recession. The latest projections from the Federal Opening Market Committee (2022), as well as the consensus forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (FRBP, 2022) supports the soft-landing view: in both forecasts, inflation recedes to below 3% and unemployment remains below 4% by 2023.====The idea that inflation can fall dramatically without a corresponding rise in labor market slack, however, runs counter to standard economic theory, and is inconsistent with the historical evidence. The original Phillips curve suggests that there is a trade-off between the tightness of the labor market, usually proxied by the aggregate unemployment rate, and inflation. The empirical evidence supports the view that taming accelerating inflation requires a substantial increase in economic slack. Since 1955, there has never been a quarter with price inflation above 4% and unemployment below 5% that was not followed by a recession within the next two years.====In this paper, we focus on evidence from the US labor market to evaluate the plausibility that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing of the economy. We begin by summarizing our earlier work (Domash & Summers, 2022) that shows that the labor market today is significantly tighter than implied by the unemployment rate. The number of job vacancies per unemployed is higher than it’s been in 70 years (see Fig. 1), and worker quits remain significantly elevated, putting additional pressure on nominal wages. We estimate that the unemployment rate that is consistent with the current levels of job vacancies and worker quits is below 2%, and that this measure is more significant for predicting wage inflation than the actual unemployment rate or employment ratio. This suggests that we should currently be thinking about US labor markets as extraordinarily tight.====Next, we show that this historically tight labor market has coincided with the highest levels of wage growth in the past 40 years. In February 2022, year-over-year wage inflation reached 6.5% according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta,==== the highest on record. Wage inflation has also accelerated at a rapid pace – increasing by nearly 2 percentage points over the last 3 months and nearly 3 percentage points over the last year – and will likely continue to rise through the rest of 2022. Using a wage Phillips curve model with a weighted three-year lagged inflation to proxy for inflation expectations, we find that the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio predicts wage inflation near 7% by the end of the year, and that firm-side unemployment also predicts wage inflation to rise. Such a high level of wage inflation is likely to contribute significantly to underlying price inflation unless productivity rises sharply, or firms cannot pass on cost increases to consumers – both of which are contrary to recent experience.====Finally, we look at the historical evidence from the labor market to assess the likelihood that monetary policy can lower accelerating inflation without substantially increasing economic slack. We show that historically, high levels of wage inflation have been associated with a high risk of a subsequent recession. Since 1955, there has never been a quarter where average wage inflation surpassed 5% and the average unemployment rate was below 5% that was not followed by a recession over the next two years. There have also only been two periods where wage inflation fell by more than one percentage point in a year – in 1973 and 1982 – and both times coincided with a recession. We show that periods that historically have been hailed as successful soft landings – including 1965, 1984, and 1994 – all had labor markets that were substantially less tight than the present moment. Taken together, the evidence suggests a very low likelihood that the Federal Reserve can reduce inflation without causing a significant slowdown in economic activity and a substantial increase in economic slack.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes our past work on estimating labor market tightness.

This paper finds, after controlling for variables related to farming distress, that the timing of waiver announcements by state governments between 2001-02 and 2018–19 is associated with the timing of elections. This points toward a pattern of policy manipulation that suggests election-year targeting of the largest special interest group in India, namely farming households. The debt waivers, either announced as policies by incumbent governments prior to upcoming elections or as election pledges by political parties which are fulfilled after winning elections, are unanticipated shocks to government revenue expenditure. We find that the waivers are associated with an increased revenue deficit, which is accommodated by a nearly 1/3rd cut in capital outlay to control the fiscal deficit, given the presence of a fiscal rule. Given its path dependence, lower capital expenditure also reduces the quality of government spending in subsequent years.","It is commonly believed that incumbent governments, with the desire to get reelected, indulge in raising public spending and/or lowering taxes before the elections. A vast body of theoretical and empirical literature over the last five decades that followed the seminal paper by Nordhaus (1975) has resulted in several refinements and applications of the original proposition of the political budget cycle (PBC) theory (Alesina et al., 1997, Brender and Drazen, 2005, Brender and Drazen, 2008, Shi and Svensson, 2006 among others). Another strand of the literature shows how election campaign promises – both by the incumbent government and the opposition parties, and their post-election fulfilment are central to electoral accountability in a representative democracy (Cruz et al., 2018, Mansergh and Thomson, 2007; among others). Contrary to the popular notion of pledge-breaking politicians, elected political parties fulfil most of their pre-election promises (Dupont et al., 2019) which result in higher public spending and fiscal deficit, ceteris paribus.====One of the sectors that lends itself to such kind of political maneuvering, especially in developing countries, is agriculture, given that a large proportion of the population depends on farming for their livelihoods. Agrarian distress in developing countries has been linked to farmers’ inability to repay farm debt (Hoff & Stiglitz, 1990) including in India, where there were nearly 93.1 million agricultural households totalling nearly 456 million people (around 33% of India’s population) who were dependent primarily on agriculture for their livelihood in 2019 (National Statistical Organization, 2021). In recent years farming distress has led to a rise in farmers’ protests (Himanshu, 2018) and has also been linked to farmers’ suicides (Merriott, 2016). There are a multitude of factors leading to farming distress such as crop failures caused by droughts or excess rainfall and a lack of remunerative prices (Merriott, 2016, Parida et al., 2018). Given this scenario, the national and sub-national state governments in India have increasingly resorted to a popular agriculture policy intervention, the farm debt forgiveness programs, locally known as farm debt waivers, with 15 such programs announced by the state governments between 2014 and 2019.====This study has two main objectives. By focusing on farm debt waiver schemes at the state level in India between 2001–02 and 2018–19====, we empirically investigate (1) the determinants of the ‘timing’ of the announcements of debt waiver programs and if political parties display opportunistic behaviour in the waiver policy announcements with an intent to influence election outcomes. (2) if there is an existence of PBCs in farm debt waiver schemes in terms of their effect on state finances, namely on fiscal deficit and state expenditure components such as revenue and capital expenditure, in the presence of a fiscal rule adopted by the states.====Theory suggests that rational and forward-looking voters anticipate the political incentive of incumbent governments to expand fiscal policy, thus lowering chances of a PCB (Rogoff and Sibert, 1988, Rogoff, 1990 among others). However, in the case of farm debt waivers, political parties can overcome the rational electorate by pledging a waiver and signalling a commitment to implement it, if they are elected. Alternatively, since the farm debt waiver has a relatively faster, direct, and has a demonstrable positive impact on the lives of a large section of the electorate body, the incumbent government may announce a waiver before the election, even if other voter constituencies may not approve of such expansion in public expenditure. On similar lines, Phadnis and Goswamy (2019) suggest that farm debt waivers in India are decisions taken by political parties of different ideologies and are strategically timed to coincide with the electoral calender. No study, however, has empirically tested the PBC arguments for this increasingly popular policy.====There is, however, a trade-off that the state governments in India face while implementing the debt waiver schemes. Following the Central government’s adoption of a fiscal rule, most state governments by 2006 enacted the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL), which was a commitment to move towards lowering fiscal deficit to under 3% of state GDP by 2009 (Chakraborty & Dash, 2017). While even in the earlier period, the central government had a control over the market borrowings of the states that fund fiscal deficit and indirectly placed an upper cap on their fiscal deficit, the official adoption of a fiscal rule could further reduce the incentive of political parties for fiscal profligacy. It not only increases the cost of pre-election fiscal expansion or promised profligacy if re-elected, but the elected government also faces a reputational risk by not being seen to be abiding by the fiscal rule. Among other papers, Rose (2006) for the states in the US and Bonfatti and Forni (2019) in the case of Italian municipalities show fiscal rules limit politicians' ability to manipulate the budget for electoral gains. Even in the presence of a fiscal rule, the incumbent politicians can, however, shift the composition of the government spending towards voters' preferences without raising the overall spending and/or fiscal deficit (Drazen & Eslava, 2010). The debt waiver policy, which is a targeted spending, fits into this kind of political manipulation since it increases the current spending while allowing the government to lower the capital spending or other kinds of current spending if the total public expenditure is to be maintained in order to adhere to the overall fiscal rule.====Our main results are as follows. Our analysis based on panel logistic regression models reveals that the debt waiver announcements are not ‘timed’ during years of high farmer suicides or moderate or severe droughts which raise financial distress. In contrast, the waiver announcements or its promises are timed around the election year either by incumbent governments or as promised in the election manifesto of political parties before the elections and implemented just after winning the elections by which time farming distress also builds up. The result that political parties across the spectrum behave strategically to win the electorate during the elections is robust to different specifications as well as estimation methods and supports the opportunistic motive of political parties as suggested by the PBC theory.====Using dynamic panel data models and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation method to correct for the potential endogeneity issues, we further show that while debt waivers are associated with increased revenue deficit, they had no bearing on the fiscal deficit of states, which is in line with the FRL adherence. A fiscal rule, thus, helps contain the adverse impact of farm debt waivers. We, however, find that the farm debt waiver schemes have been accommodated by a one-third cut in the capital outlay, on average, especially through a reduction in developmental capital outlay during the years of the waiver announcement. Our estimates have a potential under-estimation bias since the state governments spread the expenditures incurred on debt waivers over 2–3 years after the waiver announcements are made. The opportunistic behaviour of the governments, which announce farm debt waivers, therefore, has a negative effect on social welfare since the composition of public spending is tweaked to achieve specific electoral goals (Alesina, 1987, Alesina, 1988). In our case, it specifically reduces the ability of the state governments to maintain/increase capital spending including on agriculture such as irrigation and roads, which is important for resolving the agriculture distress in India. Overall, therefore, while the fiscal rule helps tame the PBC, it is only partially welfare-enhancing since it occurs at a cost of a fall in capital spending, in line with assertion by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) (2019a).====We contribute to the four strands of the empirical literature that relate to (1) the literature on PBCs, especially at a sub-national level, (2) the studies which explore the impact of election pledges and their fulfilment, (3) the implications of a fiscal rule for PBCs, and (4) the nature and impact of the agricultural policies in India. First, our novel empirical strategy differs from the existing literature on the empirical studies of the PBC theory, in that it allows us to capture the impact of a pre-election strategy of announcing debt waiver schemes by incumbent governments as well as the fulfilment of pre-election promises by the newly elected government. Second, our work extends the literature on the policies that contribute to the PBC at the sub-national level (Alesina & Paradisi, 2017; Bonafatti & Forni, 2019 among others) in general and specifically in the context of India where only a handful of studies have explored the PBC angle at the subnational level (Khemani, 2004, Min and Golden, 2014). It provides the reasoning and evidence for the compositional effect of public expenditure in favour of current expenditure, unlike the majority of studies that show the compositional effect in favour of capital spending (see Gupta et al., 2015 for a review of papers on PBCs and capital spending).====Third, we contribute to the relatively sparse literature on how fiscal rules can limit the overall magnitude of the PBC and thereby lower the incentive for fiscal profligacy. The national government by encouraging the adoption of the fiscal rule at the sub-national level, can limit the combined fiscal deficits (national plus sub-national) and lower its potential negative welfare consequences in terms of inflation. This in turn would lower the requirements for the monetary offset by the central bank of fiscal easing during the election years. Finally, we extend the literature that studies the motivation and the impact of agricultural policies in general and farm debt waiver programs in particular (Giné and Kanz, 2017, Narayanan and Mehrotra, 2019, Phadnis and Goswamy, 2019, Raj and Prabu, 2018). We believe this is the first paper in the context of India that econometrically explores the farm debt waivers as the pre-election strategy by political parties and documents its adverse impact on the capital expenditure of state governments which among other sectors, can lower much-needed public investment in agriculture itself.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the policy backdrop and determinants of farm debt waivers, the institutional political set up and the fiscal rule. Section 3 discusses insights from data and lays out the hypotheses, while section 4 investigates empirically if the debt waiver schemes are timed in line with electoral calendar and its impact on state’s finances. Section 5 discusses the interpretation of the results while section 6 details the policy implications and suggestions for future research.

On February 21, 2022, the Russian government recognized the independence of disputed Ukrainian territories in Donbas, namely, the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). Under the Doctrine of humanitarian intervention,==== the Russian government proceeded with deploying the build-up of armed forces positioned around Ukraine’s borders at the beginning of the year. Invasion troops initially moved to the self-proclaimed separatist in Eastern Ukraine. They then targeted major cities and their infrastructure across Ukraine, including Berdyansk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Sumy, and the capital Kyiv. At the moment of writing, the epicenter of the invasion is limited to Eastern Ukraine (Office of the high Commisioner for human rights, 2022).====One hundred forty-one countries voted in the U.N. General Assembly resolution condemning the Russian invasion in Ukraine and demanded the immediate and complete withdrawal of the invasion troops from Ukrainian territory (see Figure 1). The international outcry about the Russian invasion was followed by the quick official response of the international organizations. The United Nations (UN) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also expressed disapproval of the unjustified Russian invasion in Ukraine. They recommended the diplomatic resolution of the Russo-Ukraine conflict. The European Union (EU) and the Group of Seven (G7) imposed unprecedented sanctions on the Russian Federation, leading the Russian economy on the verge of a recession.====Indeed, sanctions set a chain of events in the Russian economy. In the macroeconomic context, the ban of the Russian Federation from the SWIFT financial messaging system==== excluded the Russian economy from international financial transactions. The response of the financial markets το SWΙFT sanctions was immediate (Congressional Research Service, 2022). The Russian central bank announced foreign exchange interventions to support domestic bank liquidity (Central Banking Newsdesk, 2022). The temporary ruble devaluation raised imports’ domestic prices (BBC News, 2022).====The central bank counteracted and imposed capital controls by doubling its benchmark interest rates to control currency depreciation and hyperinflation (Verma, 2022). Empirically, currency devaluation in developing countries has a contractionary effect in the short run and an expansionary impact in the long run (Connolly, 1983, Gylfason and Risager, 1984, Gylfason and Schmid, 1983). However, ruble devaluation will have a neutral effect on Russian exports. The United States banned Russian energy-related imports, followed by the European Union.==== The indefinite suspension of business operations for more than 750 international companies in Russia will further trade contraction. Trade disturbances consequently affected the Russian industry. One after the other, Russian factories suspended their operations due to shortages in raw materials and no access to parts and supplies. This synchronized shutdown of the factory production lines implies sharp cutbacks and sizeable output contraction with imminent repercussions on economic activity. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that the synchronized decline of industrial production, consumption, and investment would lead to an economic contraction of 8.5%, an inflation jump to 8.5%, and a doubled-rate unemployment increase of 9.6% (Congressional Research Service, 2022).====The double-edged sword of the European Union sanctions may also disproportionately affect the European economies. Figure 2 reflects the trade flows between European Union and the Russian Federation from 2011 to 2021. In 2021, the bilateral trade and Investment flows amounted to €257.5 billion and to €447.4 billion, respectively. The European Union recorded a trade deficit with Russia of € 89 billion in 2011 that narrowed sharply to € 69 billion in 2021, indicating a significant drop of approximately 22.5% points (European Commission, 2022b). Despite the Russia Federation’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2012, the government’s import substitution policies contravened WTO regulations and policies. European Union filed six disputes at the WTO against Russia Federation’s import restrictions====: recycling fee on imported vehicles (2013); import duties (2014); anti-dumping policies on small-sized vehicles (2014); an embargo on pig meat due to strict sanitary policies (2014); SOE procurement (2021); and wood exports (2022) (European Commission, 2022a). The aforementioned underlying tensions between EU-Russia explain to a great extent the last decade’s bilateral trade’s declining trend and the European Union’s consideration of reducing the union’s dependency on Russian imports in the context of national security (Gontmakher, 2021).====This paper suggests an analytical framework for estimating the economic consequences of military aggression.

Accordingly, increases in the minimum wage lead to job losses for unskilled labour, mainly in plants with fewer than 100; thus, small increases in the minimum wage are desirable to protect employment. Labour demand is highly cyclical: the output elasticity is about 1.7. Thus, some flexibility in labour contracts is desirable to reduce the link between employment and variation of plants’ sales. Open-ended labour contracts might allow reductions of the nominal wage rather than inducing job losses during periods of severe slumps, as has happened during the COVID-19 pandemic.","As in many other developing countries, in Colombia the minimum wage (MW, hereafter) is a crucial policy variable. Its purpose is to protect workers from being paid unduly low wages (International Labour Organization, 2014). The International Labour Organization (ILO) further argues that its existence helps to reduce poverty and inequalities.====Although the MW is present nearly worldwide,==== there is no agreement on whether it reaches its objectives or not. In fact, there are controversies concerning the effects of the MW on different aspects of the labour market, such as employment, unemployment, labour informality, etc., and on other dimensions of the economy, such as poverty and income distribution, fiscal balances, pensions and protection for the elderly, economic growth, and so on. By focusing on the employment effects, Neumark and Wascher (2008) show that the MW reduces employment opportunities for less-skilled workers, especially for those whose wage is close to the MW, as employers tend to replace these workers with more qualified employees when the MW increases. Neumark (2018) asserts that the MW has adverse effects on employment, a conclusion based on studies about economies as diverse as Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States (see also Neumark & Shirley, 2021). For developing countries, Andalón and Pagés (2008) found adverse effects of MW legislation in Kenya on formal employment as well as an increase in labour informality. Broecke, Forti, and Vandeweyer (2017) have compiled evidence on some developing countries, showing that while on average the effects on employment generally are not large, there are important negative effects for some vulnerable groups such as young people and low-skilled workers (see also Okudaira, Takizawa, & Yamanouchi, 2019; Wang, Phillips, & Su, 2019).====In contrast, Card, 1992aaa, Card, 1992bbb and Card and Krueger, 1994, Card and Krueger, 1995 presented evidence that casts doubt on the finding that increases in the MW have adverse effects on employment. In fact, they have shown that the increases have positive effects. Meta-analyses conducted by Doucouliagos and Stanley (2009) found a negligible effect of the MW on teenage employment in the United States (see also Belman & Wolfson, 2014; De Linde Leonard, Stanley, & Doucouliagos, 2014, chapter 4). More recently, Millea, Rezek, Shoup, and Pitts (2017) have shown that after the introduction of the MW in 2002 in South Africa, there were no effects on the formal employment of any demographic group covered by the law, although there are effects for other workers in informal sectors covered by the legislation. Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010) used two different methodologies for cross-state neighbouring counties and nationwide – the former showed no employment effects while the latter has a labour-demand elasticity close to –1.====The Colombian labour market presents some undesirable outcomes that have been, on occasions, related to the level of the MW with respect to labour productivity of less-skilled workers or with respect to the median wage. Among such outcomes are the high structural and observed unemployment rates, the high rate of labour informality, the large regional differences in labour market outcomes, and sizeable gender gaps, etc. Thus, it seems that in Colombia there is a lot of room for policy interventions to improve the performance of the labour market.====Arango & Flórez (2020a) provide evidence that the MW has been a determinant of structural unemployment since 1984.==== Moreover, given the low productivity of the labour force,==== there is evidence that the MW is a key determinant of the high labour informality. In fact, according to Arango & Flórez (2020b), the high level of the MW with respect to the median wage (about 85 %) might be one source of the high labour informality rate and other symptoms of the faulty functioning of the labour market.==== Thus, Colombia seems to be an interesting case to observe the effects of the MW policy with regards to employment.====Our aim in this paper is to verify, by using the panel structure of the Annual Manufacturing Survey (AMS) at (anonymized) establishment level, whether the MW has had adverse effects on employment in the manufacturing sector between 2000 and 2015, and then to suggest modifications in the use of this policy variable. By differentiating across the skills and contract modalities of workers and the size of plants, we estimate, within a partial equilibrium framework, the demand for labour. We focus on long-term elasticities to the MW, own-factor price, output and total factor productivity (TFP). Small plants correspond to those with 99 workers at most while large establishments have at least 100 workers. Our motivation to observe the response of small and large plants stems from the belief that the former exhibit lower labour productivity and lower TFP.==== If this is so, increases in the MW are expected to have higher effects on employment in small plants. Because the primary source of variation is the exogenous change of the MW set annually over the whole country, which we transform into real variations across subsectors, our approach is closer to the case of a nationwide study (Dube et al., 2010).====A number of authors have previously studied the factors behind labour demand in the manufacturing sector of Colombia (Arango and Rojas, 2003, Eslava et al., 2010, Medina et al., 2013, Roberts and Skoufias, 1997; and, more recently, Arango, Castellani, & Obando, 2019). Nevertheless, only Bell (1997) explicitly analysed the effects of the MW, finding that the elasticity of employment with respect to the MW was –0.33 %. Also using the AMS panel data, Bell estimated that the elasticity of employment with respect to the MW is between –0.15 % and –0.33 % in the case of unskilled workers and between –0.03 % and –0.24 % for qualified workers. Our work combines the approach of Bell (1997) with contract modalities in more fully fledged labour demand functions, both conditional and unconditional, for small and large manufacturing establishments.====As mentioned above, we exploit the variations of the real MW across subsectors. Apart from distinguishing between permanent/temporary and skilled/unskilled workers, our approach is novel in decomposing the own-factor price between the contributions of the MW and the own policy wage of the firms. This decomposition of the real wage allows us to estimate the effects of the real MW variations as well as those of the own-factor price of the individual manufacturing establishments. We find that, ceteris paribus, increases in the real MW reduce the employment mainly of unskilled workers, with both permanent and temporary contracts, in small plants. Thus, the policy of sustained large increases in the real MW since 2000 has not helped formal employment in Colombia, as we show in this paper. Instead, we recommend that increases in the MW should be as small as possible.====In the estimation of the factors behind the labour demand, we also find a large cyclicality of employment in the industrial sector; in fact, the evidence suggests that labour demand is highly dependent on the demand for the products of the manufacturing establishments. This result can be used to encourage a policy aimed at reducing the fluctuations of employment tied to the movements of output, such as the strong contraction produced by the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a policy might consider decreases in the wage rigidities of labour contracts when the economy is undergoing important slowdowns and the plant’s sales are suffering a major contraction (see Elsby & Solon, 2019; Doris, O’Neill, & Sweetman, 2020). Of course, this flexibility – in particular, for wage reductions – should be bounded and qualified by the contraction of sales. For the case of Colombia, Agudelo and Sala (2017) estimate the downward real wage rigidity to be over 12 %, notoriously higher than for OECD countries. The flexibility should also consider increases of wages in the case of booms. Thus, the two policies we propose might improve the performance of the Colombian labour market.====The rest of the paper develops as follows. In Section 2 , we present the data and the empirical approach. In Section 3, we discuss the results of the estimated models and their most likely implications. Finally, we draw some conclusions and suggest policy recommendations in Section 4.",Moderate wage increases and flexible labour contracts to protect employment in Colombian manufacturing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000369,May–June 2022,2022,Research Article,70.0

This finding has relevance for the design of anti-corruption coordination across nations.","The continuing presence of corruption worldwide has national leaders and international organizations looking beyond national borders for effective policy coordination to combat corruption. International trade, globalization (Lalountas et al., 2011), social interactions (Dong & Torgler, 2012), and even the current coronavirus pandemic (Goel et al., 2021) can lead to spillovers of corrupt practices and/or attitudes.====Over the years, international organizations such as the OECD, IMF, and The World Bank have undertaken different initiatives to highlight the problem of international corruption and to improve governance. For instance, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, “… establishes legally binding standards to criminalise bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions and provides for a host of related measures that make this effective”, https://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm. As of 2018, 44 nations, 38 OECD countries and 6 non-OECD countries, had adopted this Convention.====Earlier, in 1997, the IMF adopted a policy on how to address economic governance, and in 2018 it adopted a new Framework for Enhanced Engagement on Governance (Governance Policy) that aims to “ promote more systematic, effective, candid, and evenhanded engagement with member countries regarding governance vulnerabilities—including corruption—that are critical to macroeconomic performance”, https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/governance-and-anti-corruption#:~:text=Corruption%20alters%20the%20incentives%20of,stunts%20a%20country's%20economic%20potential. One practical issue with these initiatives has been the lack of effective enforcement or “teeth” (see Capasso et al., 2019).====Whereas there is some recognition about cross-national anti-corruption coordination, it is unclear what the scope of such coordination should be. There is also recognition of the need for new approaches to combat international corruption – see https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/corruption-has-modernized-so-should-anticorruption-initiatives. Should nations coordinate anti-corruption efforts with their immediate neighbors, or should there be regional or international coordination? This research will attempt to add insights in this respect.====In order to better understand the forces driving corruption, the empirical literature on the determinants of corruption has over the past decade considered spatial spillovers (Becker et al., 2009, Borsky and Kalkschmied, 2019, Goel and Nelson, 2007). The main argument is that corruption in neighboring jurisdictions (e.g., countries, states), through formal and informal exchanges and demonstration effects (learning about ways to be corrupt), has a positive spillover effect. Corruption can be seen as a signal of (weak) institutional quality and for strategic reasons nations might devote more attention to corruption-control or corruption prevalence in their countries vis-à-vis their immediate neighbors than with nations farther away.====Most of the related literature considers aggregate level — either cross-national corruption spillovers (Becker et al., 2007; Khodapanah et al., 2020; Márquez et al., 2011; Goel & Saunoris, 2014; Sui et al., 2018) or cross-state spillovers (Goel & Nelson, 2007); however, more recently, some attention is being paid to spillovers across more disaggregated jurisdictions (Borsky and Kalkschmied, 2019, López-Valcárcel et al., 2017). Along a broader dimension, trade spillovers across nations have been more widely studied (McCallum, 1995, Nitsch, 2000), with some research also on institutional spillovers (Faber and Gerritse, 2012, Faber and Gerritse, 2016). These spillovers can be beneficial or harmful and likely dependent on a nation’s immutable geographic attributes.====This paper provides another, previously not considered, dimension to border influences on corruption. Specifically, we look at the number of bordering nations and the length of the national land border on the influence of corruption in a nation. These geographic attributes might increase or decrease the spillovers of corruption across national borders.====The number of different neighbors that a nation has can be seen as external government fragmentation whereby more bribes might need to be offered on the one hand to build different corrupt relations, while on the other hand, the greater transaction costs of dealing with additional governments might act as an entry barrier for participants in corrupt exchanges. Such fragmentation also will impact enforcement coordination and any coalition formation among bureaucratic rent-seekers, with potentially positive or negative effects on corrupt activity.====The length of a nation’s land border relates to the ability to police the border and to the opportunities for corrupt exchanges across a longer border. For instance, longer borders increase opportunities for illegal trafficking of people and goods, while also increasing the costs of policing such borders. Potential lawbreakers, weighing the costs and benefits of their actions à la Becker (1968) would use corruption or bribe payments to skew the relative costs and benefits to their advantage. Nations’ land borders may also keep corruption in check in order to attract capital (FDI) from neighboring nations.====Bordering nations generally face common histories through colonial pasts, historic migrations, etc. In instances of long-running animosities between neighbors (e.g., India-Pakistan; Turkey-Greece, etc.) corrupt activity might arise due to the corruption-military spending nexus (Goel & Saunoris, 2016). While corrupt exchanges between trading nations are common and plausible (e.g., corruption in customs to evade tariffs or quotas, etc.), nations with closed borders (e.g., India-Pakistan) might have corruption spillovers through smuggling (of goods or human trafficking) and via demonstration of corrupt behavior of economic agents on the other side. More broadly, institutional change might spread across nations (Faber & Gerritse, 2016). Thus, adjacent nations, even when they are otherwise free of corruption (e.g., Finland) might face corruption spillovers from nations bordering them (e.g., Russia).====Overall, given the various avenues impacting corruption in bordering nations, it seems instructive, both from the literature and policy perspectives, to account for the various geographic dimensions that impact corruption in neighbors. This study uses annual data from 2012-2018 on 147 nations and considers the effects of the length of land borders and the number of neighboring nations on a nation’s corruption. Key questions addressed are:====Results show that while border corruption positively affects corruption in a nation, a longer border and more neighbors have a mitigating effect on corruption. Thus, there are differing influences on a nation’s corruption. These new findings imply that a nation’s geographic attributes might play a larger role in transmissions of border influences on corruption than previously recognized.====The rest of the paper includes the model, data, and estimation in the next section, followed by results and conclusions.",Corrupt thy neighbor?

While conflicts between ==== monitoring and performance of SOEs do exist, the 2012 anticorruption movement has profoundly changed Chinese political entrepreneurs’ power choice and accountability for SOE ====. Specifically, this paper shows that the anticorruption measures have effectively reduced the sum of perks but aroused excessive asset extraction. When perk consumption has been seriously curtailed by the anticorruption rules, SOE executives’ reversed expectation precipitates their opportunistic activities in SOE’s tangible asset management and undermines SOE’s long-term corporate value.","State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China are created by the Chinese government to participate in business activities. The executives working in SOEs are not only business managers but also government agents appointed to operate the firm. For SOE executives, a successful career path is normally defined as political promotion, rather than appreciation in the professional managers market.==== Hence, behind principal-agent relationships in China’s SOEs is a dual hierarchy: between the government and executives, and between executives and the firm. SOE executives, by nature, work as a political entrepreneur linking the two hierarchies, taking up political responsibility for managing state assets in the market.====As a result of such a two-layer hierarchy, the management incentive system in SOEs performs three main functions: ====) at the executive-firm level, stimulate executives’ effort level to maximise the return to state capital; (====) at the government-executive level, facilitate SOE executives to build rapport with superior government agencies for easy access to resources, and (====) incentivise SOE executives to carve their own political career path after SOE appointment. For SOE executives, the last function – political promotion – is of crucial importance.====Theoretically the maximisation of work effort and optimisation of compensation during the duration of a political entrepreneur’s “incomplete contract” (Dewatripont et al., 1999, Fama, 1980, Jensen and William, 1976) can be reached through the balancing of “monetary” and “political” incentives (Gibbons and Kevin, 1992, Holcombe, 2002). In most circumstances, executive perks in China are used as “grease” money (Cai et al., 2011) to satisfy government officials to facilitate business budgeting and resource allocation (Blackburn and Gonzalo, 2009, Wang and Yan, 2020). Compared to private firms, SOE executives are generally more prone to aberrant perk consumption: politically, SOE executives’ non-economic social identity demands them to use extra perks to please supervisory officials in order to enhance their political participation prospects; economically, the public sector in China does not implement a market-based pay structure, a reason for the lower-than-private sector wages of SOE executives. In this sense, aberrant perk system is a form of compensatory incentives for SOE executives (Yermack, 2006) to narrow this pay gap as a way protect state assets in market business participation.==== For this reason aberrant perk consumption before 2012 could be taken as a “perks-in-exchange for loyalty” (Shen & Zhao, 2016) measure that was commonly applied in Chinese state-owned economy.====In 2012, Xi Jinping – the newly appointed Chinese president– started to launch a fierce anticorruption campaign – à la “Eight Rules Regarding Improvement of Style of Work and Close Links with the Population” (Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, 2012).==== The eight-point austerity rules (henceforth “eight rules”) compressed most perk expenditures of political bureaucrats,==== and defined the extent and main characters of Xi’s far-reaching anticorruption campaign. Officials and SOE executives who violate the eight rules could face criminal prosecution. Perk expenditures in the entire political party system had thence been drastically reduced to the minimum necessary level by Xi’s austerity anticorruption measures. The problem lies with the sweeping way Xi’s austerity rules were applied to both bureaucrats “in government” and those “in business”. The traditional intent of a balanced incentive structure for Chinese political entrepreneurs has thence been censured.====This work is inspired by studies on the impact of corruption monitoring on agency cost (Barassi and Zhou, 2012, Blackburn and Forgues-Puccio, 2009, Fang et al., 2018, Hart, 1988, Hart, 1995, Hart, 2001, Jensen and William, 1976, Krammer, 2019, Krueger, 1974, Méon and Sekkat, 2005, North, 1990, Tullock, 1967, Wright et al., 2005, Zhao et al., 2019) and corporate governance in response to regulatory changes (e.g. Adithipyangkul et al., 2011; Che, 2002; Peng et al., 2016). With the sudden implementation of rules in 2012, most SOE executives involved likely complied with anticorruption requirements and reduced the sum of perks (Mei & Ge, 2016; Shi et al., 2022; Yang, 2016;). However, with the deepening of anticorruption campaign, seriously curtailed “political” incentives, compelling SOE executives to quickly cash out their business power in hand, precipitating hidden actions in SOEs such as the embezzlement of state assets. Thus, different causation may lead to flaws in the empirical analysis between anticorruption movement and SOE corporate performance in the long term (e.g. Adithipyangkul et al., 2011; Méndez & Sepúlveda, 2006; Nguyen & Mathijs, 2012; Rajan & Wulf, 2006; Wang & Kong, 2016). Putting aside the immediate effect of anticorruption rules on SOEs (Yermack, 2006; Luo and Huang 2008), few went further to examine the long-term working mechanism of anticorruption on SOE corporate value and performance. In what follows this paper revisits the nexus in question with firm-level empirical studies.====Section 2 explains research hypotheses; Section 3 introduces the data and analytical framework; Section 4 presents the empirical results; Section 5 discusses policy implications; and Section 6 concludes the paper.",Haste makes waste: Political entrepreneur’s rent-seeking choices in anti-corruption campaign,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000291,2 June 2022,2022,Research Article,72.0

The research includes 26 countries in the period 1997–2019, with a special focus on the period 2008–2019. Our ==== consists of two approaches: dynamic panel modeling and ","The choice of a monetary policy model that, at low cost, ensures low and stable inflation is an important topic of economic policy. Many central banks have adopted inflation targeting (IT) as a monetary policy strategy. Since 1990, when IT was first introduced in New Zealand, the popularity of this strategy has grown substantially. Today there are approximately 40 central banks that have implemented this monetary approach, and many others are preparing for the same monetary framework. Following this trend, almost half of the former socialist countries in Europe and Central Asia have adopted IT over the past two and a half decades.====The question is how successful the IT monetary approach has been not only in maintaining stable inflation rates, but also in supporting unemployment reduction and the achievement of other macroeconomic goals. The problem of slow economic recovery became particularly severe for IT central banks during and after the Great Recession, although they managed to achieve low inflation rates and keep the expected inflation under control. In contrast, during the COVID pandemic, strong monetary expansion, together with fiscal stimulus, contributed to the rapid recovery of economic activity and maintenance of employment, but inflation reached a maximum in comparison to the last few decades in both IT and non-inflation targeting (NT) countries. Some opinions have even expressed suspicion towards using IT policy based on the consumer price index in emerging economics during and after the Great Recession (Frankel, 2010).====The aim of our paper is to evaluate the effects of IT on macroeconomic performance in the former socialist countries of Europe and Central Asia. Our sample covers 26 economies that are considered in the period 1997–2019, of which 12 apply IT and 14 apply other monetary policy models. During the second half of the 1990 s, the Czech Republic and Poland introduced the IT policy model, and throughout the first two decades of the 21st century, 10 more former socialist countries in Europe and Central Asia adopted it. NT countries in our sample apply different monetary policy models, such as a hard peg exchange rate regime in the form of a currency board (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Estonia until 2011, and Lithuania until 2015), while others ==== apply a fixed exchange rate regime (Croatia, Latvia, and North-Macedonia). A number of countries became members of the euro zone during the analyzed period: Slovenia (2007), Slovakia (2009), Estonia (2011), Latvia (2014), and Lithuania (2015), while Montenegro unilaterally adopted the euro (2002). Since hard peg exchange rate regimes result in low inflation (Yamada, 2013), the significant presence in our sample of NT countries using hard peg exchange rate regimes is an additional challenge for the IT policy model when comparing the level and volatility of inflation.====The countries in our sample are relatively homogeneous as they all have the characteristics of small open economies, and the degree of dollarization in most of them is high, while the differences in the level of development are moderate. In addition, all the countries share a socialist legacy. Since the early 1990 s, they have implemented similar reforms aimed at establishing market economies. Although the countries in our sample differ in terms of progress in institution building, level of development, their size, history of high inflation etc., these differences are smaller than in studies involving developed and developing countries or only developing countries around the world. Moderate differences between the countries in the sample are an advantage for testing the macroeconomic effects of IT against the effects of alternative monetary arrangements.====At the time of the introduction of IT, the former socialist countries of Europe and Central Asia, like other developing countries, only partially met the standard conditions for its introduction (Batini & Laxton, 2007). During the first decade of transition, they liberalized prices and foreign trade, established an independent central bank, made progress in the development of the financial sector, and made progress in establishing a sustainable fiscal position. However, at the time of the adoption of IT, most countries in transition had less-developed financial institutions, lower credibility of monetary institutions, a fragile fiscal position (some of them), a higher degree of currency substitution and liability dollarization, and weaker resistance to sudden stops of capital inflows. In addition, the analytical capacity of their central banks to model and forecast economic developments was lower than that of central banks in developed countries (Batini & Laxton, 2007).====There is no agreement in the economic literature on the extent to which strict compliance with these conditions is necessary for IT to function successfully. There are arguments that it is not necessary for countries to strictly meet these conditions at the time of IT implementation, but that for its successful operation it is necessary to gradually progress in implementing these conditions during the implementation of IT (Amato and Gerlach, 2002, Batini and Laxton, 2007). Also, several studies have provided evidence that the introduction of IT has a positive effect on the establishment of fiscal discipline, strengthening the analytical capacity in central banks as well as increasing the credibility of the central bank (Leeper, 2009; Abo-Zaid and Tuzemen, 2012, Arsić et al., 2022, Ferreira de Mendonça et al., 2012). Thus, IT policy has faced many challenges in its implementation in emerging economies, as discussed above. On the other hand, it is expected that these economies would benefit significantly from IT policy in terms of ensuring low and stable inflation rates without negative effects on output. This is the reason for focusing on this group of countries to examine the effects of IT policy.====An important feature of the analyzed countries is the relatively high degree of dollarization/euroization, which in the case of loans averaged about 53% in the observed countries at the end of the previous, and during the first decade of this, century, and about 45% in the case of deposits (Chitu, 2012). In conditions of high dollarization, a significant depreciation of the national currency results in a deterioration of the asset position of households, companies, and the state, as a result of which the percentage of bad loans grows, the performance of the banking sector deteriorates, and the number of bankruptcies increases. Another consequence of high dollarization is the existence of a relatively high pass-through, as a result of which the depreciation of the domestic currency is transferred to inflation, and exchange rate volatility is largely transferred to price volatility. Exchange rate pass-through was estimated to be modest or even high in some of these economies (for example: Cheikh & Zaied, 2020; Maria-Dolores, 2009; Civcir & Akçağlayan, 2010; Mladenović and Petrović, 2014, Reyes, 2007).====This paper uses different econometric methods, based on annual data, to investigate the macroeconomic consequences of the adoption of IT in the former socialist countries of Europe and Central Asia. The paper assesses the impact of the introduction of IT in the observed countries on the level and volatility of inflation, as well as on the growth rate and volatility of GDP.====Although the econometric analyses cover the period 1997–2019, the focus of this research is on the period 2008–2019. There are at least four reasons for careful examination of the IT effects during the period 2008–2019. First, over the first half of 1997–2019, countries in our sample exhibited much larger heterogeneity in economic and institutional development, and this would not enable the precise evaluation of IT effects. Second, only two of the considered economies accepted IT policy before 2000. Third, it is relevant to examine how robust IT policy is to shocks that occurred during and after the Great Recession, given their potentially harmful effects on the sustainability of financial stability. Fourth, to the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical results of the impact of IT on the economic performance of emerging European countries that take into account the recent past.====Two different econometric techniques are employed in our paper: dynamic panel data model estimation and propensity score matching. Both approaches are based on a large set of macroeconomic control variables. They are directly encompassed by the framework of dynamic panel data models. These models are estimated by the two-step system generalized method of moments on the assumption of IT policy endogeneity. To address the ‘‘selection on observables’’ problem, we applied a variety of propensity score matching methods that use results from a probit model that also incorporates the effects of macroeconomic factors. As our objective is to evaluate the treatment effect of IT in targeting countries, the central idea of matching is to use a control group to mimic a randomized experiment.====Our paper contributes to empirical research on IT effects in four ways. First, the paper searches for the answer to the question on the macroeconomic results of the adoption of IT in small, open, highly euroized economies that only partially meet the standard conditions for its implementation. Second, although the sample covers the period 1997–2019, the focus of our research is macroeconomic IT results in the period after 2008, which is under-researched in the empirical literature. Third, two completely different econometric methodologies are implemented, with the purpose of significantly increasing the robustness of findings. Four, all the results rely on an extensive set of key macroeconomic variables.====The paper is organized as follows. A literature review is given in Section 2. Section 3 provides the data description. Key econometric findings based on the dynamic panel modeling are presented in Section 4. Results derived from the assessment of the average treatment effects are given in Section 5. Section 6 contains concluding remarks.

Recently, the worldwide rapid economic development has exacerbated well known ecological and environmental threats, such as global warming and climate change also highlighting the concept of the earth carrying capacity. On this latter, there is a broad consensus in the scientific world that the worldwide ecological footprint has been exceeding the world’s biocapacity over time. Consequently, there is a need for common and pressing environmental policies coordinates among countries aimed to reduce the environmental impact of the human activities.====Since the end of the XX century, policy makers have paid attention to set global environmental policies to contrast environmental degradation and to promote a more sustainable and equitable development (e.g., Ozcan et al., 2019). Unfortunately, the actions led by the United Nations (2016), coherently with the implementation of both the “Kyoto Protocol” and the “Paris Climate Agreement” are proving that it is difficult to try to find a solution to global challenges, without an efficient and coordinated application of the policy measures. The hardships associated with obtaining a global international agreement are due to freeriding behaviors mainly associated to the differences between developed and emerging economies (Atalla et al., 2018), which reflect the heterogeneity among countries in term of multi-dimensional characteristics of the environmental degradation issues. In this context, the notion of ecological footprint has become an important variable to be included in the economic analysis, in order to: (i) properly account for the overall environmental degradation issue (Dogan et al., 2020). (ii) reduce the gap between ecological footprint and the world’s biocapacity. The importance of ecological footprint, meaning the usage or abuse of natural resources for human development has been addressed extensively in the literature from different perspectives. Firstly, the dimension of the resources’ availability and exploitation plays a crucial role in the worldwide capacity to converge towards a common higher standard of economic and environmental quality (Blampied, 2021, Böhringer and Welsch, 2004). Secondly, the analysis of water consumption has been equally addressed in the literature as a pillar of the analysis of sustainable development (e.g., Roson & Damania, 2017). Thirdly, the literature has extensively analyzed the importance of the relationship between economic growth and emissions. and the possibility of continuing along a development path, which need to be compatible with the Brundtland principle (e.g., Hosseini & Kaneko, 2012). Surprisingly, these three aspects of the ecological footprint have not been analyzed in a simultaneous framework also taking into account macroeconomic variables that could be affected by macroeconomic policies. This paper fills this gap with three new contributions to the literature. First, we apply a new methodology that analyzes simultaneously the path of convergence of a vector of variables, labeled multivariate sigma convergence and multivariate beta-convergence. By analyzing the per-capita ecological footprint convergence of these three dimensions we focus on the crucial aspects of worldwide economic and social equity. Second, we construct a model of joint growth of three important components of the ecological footprint -the cropland usage factor, the water resources usage, and the emissions of CO2-, which includes conditioning variables that can be shaped by policy intervention. In other words, we model the relationship between the ecological footprint impact and the policy action impact in an explicit quantitative manner. In this way, we can offer to the policy maker an operational instrument to gauge the intensity of the actions needed to contrast the planet’s degradation. Third, our model is analyzing the footprint convergence process conditional to the macroeconomic policy framework. In this way we offer to the policy-maker a high degree of flexibility, because the macroeconomic instruments in our model could be considered, in turn, as intermediate targets to be addressed by more specific microeconomic instruments. We believe that the relevance of this approach is important to show that there could be alternative sets of policies to be implemented at the country level, according to the specific conditions of development, economic structure and comparative advantage. In other words, the overall building logic of our model is shown in Fig. 1.====Operationally, we show the implementation of our policy model looking at central hearth of the chain: ==== → ====. We focus the attention to two possible macro intermediate instruments: the degree of openness to international trade and the intensity of the gross fixed capital formation. We note that exports are linked to water and cropland footprint, while capital intensity is linked to water and carbon footprint. We leave out the issue of linking specific micro instruments at the country level, because this action belongs to sphere of the local sovereignty.====The important fact is that these intermediate instruments allow to change/ influence the achievement of the convergence in per capita terms, which is undoubtedly an equitable target to strive for, in order to give dignity of citizenship to every citizen of the Planet. Once the model has shown an equitable path of convergence in economic terms, our model could be used at the political level to check whether the intensity of the ecological footprint per capita is level is compatible with the availability of the Planet resources. Our tasks end before the political level, but the modeling results can help the negotiations. If there is need to compress the total ecological footprint at the world level, an equi-proportional reduction which starts from the per capita level shown in our model is probably easier to agree. In fact, one thing is to compress water, crop and energy usage of the poor at their subsistence level, another thing is to accompany with appropriate policies the convergence to a level of decency and dignity for everyone and then devise an equi-proportional policy to be applied worldwide. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related literature review. Section 3 shows the methods and data. Section 4 shows the results and Section 5 provides the discussion.

Third, non-targeted lockdowns are much more costly than age-based ones; therefore, other things equal, age-based policies should always be preferred to non-targeted ones. Our analysis also suggests that, in our sample, the over-60 workers are relatively more numerous in sectors where the value added and the integration in GVCs is lower; this feature should be kept in mind in the design of other policies as it might play an important role.","The COVID-19 pandemic has represented one of the major shocks to the global economy from the Second World War. To limit the transmission of the virus and the death toll most countries have adopted various forms of lockdown policies (====) that have generated large output losses and the disruption of (domestic and foreign) value chains with a large shrink of the world trade volumes.====One of the key features of COVID-19 disease is represented by the individual’s vulnerability exponentially increasing with age: almost 90 percent of COVID-19 deaths are people older than 60 years (====), and the mortality rate for people above 65 is about 60 times higher than those in the 20–49 years age group. Such large age-related differences in the impact of COVID-19, as well as the large losses generally associated to lockdown policies, have led many economists to study the costs and benefits of age-dependent policies finding that targeted lockdowns may represent a useful tool to reduce significantly both the death toll of the pandemic and the economic cost of the confinement (====). While the availability of vaccines has allowed many governments to soften some lockdown measures, the variants of the virus and the shortage of vaccines in many less developed countries make such policies still very useful. At the same time, the understanding of such policies for the present and future pandemics remains of major importance.====Motivated by these premises, we here analyze an age-based lockdown policy consisting of leaving at home the over-60 workers implemented under different (international) scenarios trying to answer the following three policy questions: (1) How large are the economic losses of an age-based lockdown policy? (2) To what extent the losses from lockdown in one country are affected by other countries adopting the same policy? And, therefore, in presence of ====, would the policy coordination across countries be beneficial in reducing the costs associated with such policies? (3) How do the losses from an aged-based lockdown compare to those ones where the same number of workers left at home is selected randomly among the workforces? In other words, for a given number of workers left at home, are age-based lockdowns more or less costly (and to what extent) than non-targeted ones?====To address these policy questions, we combine the data on GVCs collected from the World Input-Output Tables (WIOD) with workforce data from the EU Labour Force Survey Database for thirty countries of the European single market (ESM). We then employ the hypothetical extraction method and some of its extensions (====; ====) as this is a standard input-output tool widely used in the recent GVCs literature for studying how the value-added of a sector, a region, or a country, changes following the perturbation of the input requirements matrix (====; ====).====Our analysis is developed as follows. We first compute two measures of GVCs participation of over-60 workers by employing the decomposition method proposed by ====: (====) the ==== over-60 participation, that is the share of foreign over-60 workers integrated in the domestic value chains on total employment of a country, and (====) the ==== over-60 participation, namely the share of domestic over-60 workers’ input embodied in intermediate exports in total employment of a country. Our sample displays large cross-country variations in the backward and forward involvement of foreign over-60 workers in countries value chains that range from 0.2 to 4.4 percent and from 0.4 to 3.3 percent, respectively. These results confirm the correctness of our approach since they provide evidence on the importance of taking production links between countries and industries into account when analyzing the effects of lockdowns on the economy.====We then develop our analysis by estimating for each country (using the partial hypothetical extraction method developed by ====) the output losses from an ==== that leaves at home the over-60 workers when such policy is adopted by: (i) the home country only, (ii) all countries except the home country, and (iii) all countries simultaneously.====We find that the mean share of over-60 workers on total workforce in our sample is 7.2 percent and the estimated average output losses in the three scenarios (i)–(iii) are 3, 0.64 and 4.51 percent, respectively.==== The analysis allows us to provide an answer to the first two policy questions. First, we obtain that independently on whether all countries adopt an aged-based lockdown or not (i.e. both in scenarios (i) and (iii)), this policy has limited economic costs, beyond being an effective strategy from an epidemiological perspective. Second, the estimated losses highlight the amplification of output disruptions following the contemporaneous interruption of domestic and foreign value chains, i.e. the output losses of each country when all countries adopt the lockdown policy are substantially larger than the sum of the losses recorded in the scenarios where either the home country only or the foreign countries only implement such a policy.==== This implies that the international coordination in the adoption of lockdown policies could be a useful strategy in reducing output losses. For example, if countries are hit by the virus at different intensity over time, then governments might find it optimal to coordinate in a way that only countries most hit by the pandemic adopt lockdown policies; in this way, the consequent reduction in the contemporaneous interruption of domestic and foreign value chains leads to lower losses. An interesting corollary of this result is that the evaluations of lockdown policies that do not consider the output losses generated by the interruption of GVCs are likely to have a downward bias.====Finally, to address our third policy issue about the cost of aged-based lockdowns policies relative to those where the same number of workers left at home is selected randomly among the workforces, we re-estimate the losses under each of the three scenarios in the hypothetical situation where the share of over-60 workers is the same in all sectors. As this latter scenario is equivalent to leaving at home a random share of workers, we refer to it as the ====.====Our findings are quite striking as we obtain that a non-targeted lockdown policy leads to output losses that, on average, are more than three and a half times larger than those from the age-based policy. This result implies that age-based policies are not only more effective in reducing the death toll but also enormously less costly from an economic point of view. Therefore, other things equal, age-based lockdown policies should always be preferred to non-targeted ones. Our analysis also suggests that over-60 workers are relatively more numerous in sectors with lower value added and less integrated in the GVCs in the countries of our sample.====It is also worth remarking that while the analysis presented in this paper draws on the current COVID-19 pandemic, it has much broader policy implications.==== For example, it could guide the evaluation of policies regarding retraining older workers versus encouraging their exit from the labor market following the technological revolution related to automation and artificial intelligence that is likely to make obsolete the skills of a large number of workers.====This paper is closely related to the recent strand of the literature studying optimal targeted lockdowns policies. For example, ==== study targeted lockdowns in a multi-group SIR model and find that an age-based lockdown could limit economic losses to 7 percent of GDP, compared to 37 percent under a tight lockdown scenario. Closely related, ==== find that policies of gradual return to work may save many lives with limited economic costs, as long as they differentiate by age group. ====, ====, and ==== argue that a strong sheltering of the seniors and vulnerable persons together with a deconfinement of young and middle-aged people would reduce both the death toll of the pandemic and the economic cost of the confinement and help build herd immunity.====Our study also relates to the literature studying the economic impact of lockdown policies following COVID-19 pandemic in an input-output and GVCs framework (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Within this strand of the literature, some works have analyzed how social distancing measures and sectoral lockdown policies implemented around the world to limit the spread of the virus have generated serious disruptions to GVCs (====, ====, ====) still struggling with the recovery from the 2009 recession (====).==== Even though the number of jobs indirectly involved in GVCs has grown dramatically in the last decades due to the increasing fragmentation of production (====), all papers undertaking a lockdown scenario analysis in a production network framework have focused on the asymmetry of input-output connections neglecting the heterogeneous distribution of the workforce across sectors and GVCs.====Our work is also related to some recent papers that consider the distribution of the workforce across sectors and investigate the consequences of social distancing on employment and remote work (====), on wages (====), and on the supply and demand of goods (====). Closer to our paper, ==== and ==== develop an input-output analysis to study the economic consequences on interdependent sectors of workforce disruptions due to an influenza epidemic. The main differences between these papers and ours are that we use a multi-country approach, focus on workforce demographics, and, more importantly, our analysis compares the effects of targeted and non-targeted policies. This latter feature of our work is particularly important since it provides a useful tool to guide governments and institutions in implementing policies to mitigate the work-safety trade-off while keeping the economy going. In this sense, our paper enriches the debate on effective policy responses that could implement to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other future diseases with similar characteristics (see, among others, ====; ====; ====; ====).====The paper is organized as follows. ==== explains the methodology. ==== describes the data and the policy scenarios. ==== presents the results of our analysis and discusses the policy implications. ==== concludes.",The optimality of age-based lockdown policies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000199,10 May 2022,2022,Research Article,75.0

In addition to supplying food, agriculture is the most important source of employment, especially for women. Through the Plan for an Emerging Senegal (PES), the Senegalese government is implementing an ambitious financing plan to improve the productivity of the agricultural sector and enhance employment opportunities for women. Our study assesses the impact of two PES measures (investment subsidies and an increase in production subsidies for the agricultural sectors) on economic growth, women's employment, ==== and ==== using a dynamic ","Senegal, similar to many developing countries, faces a particularly difficult economic and social situation. According to the National Statistics Agency, in 2011, poverty affected approximately 47% of the population, including 57.1% of people living in rural areas. The capital, Dakar, accounts for 26% of the total population living in poverty (ANSD - Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la Démographie, 2013). This high level of poverty is reflected in gender dynamics. The gender development index, which measures gender inequalities in health, education and economic opportunities, is estimated at 0.88 in Senegal (UNDP (United Nations Development Program), 2015). This high index value suggests the occurrence of significant economic and social disparities related to the gender of the economic agent.====Women’s low participation rates in the labor market, the dominance of self-employed labor (low paid and vulnerable to economic vagaries), difficulties in accessing credit, and low access to infrastructure are the main factors limiting women’s economic activities in Senegal. The results of the National Employment Survey confirm the inequality indicators by showing that women have a less desirable position in the labor market than men. Indeed, the unemployment rate for women is 23.5%, whereas it is 11.4% for men (ANSD - Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la Démographie, 2015). Women are mostly unskilled (72.1%) and only 42.7% of them are active compared to men who are more active (65.8%).====In addition, the employment rate for women is estimated at 32.8%, while that for men is 59% (ANSD - Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la Démographie, 2015). In addition, it appears that the female labor force tends to more often be self-employed than employed. Women represent 49.7% of self-employed workers and only 33.2% of salaried workers (ANSD - Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la Démographie, 2015). Concerning salaried employment, 22% of women work under open-ended contracts, 32% work under fixed-term contracts and 28% work under seasonal contracts (ANSD, 2013). An analysis of the main occupations reveals that most women are self-employed farmers (31.5%) or caregivers (30.5%) (ANSD - Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la Démographie, 2015). The predominance of women in self-employment increases their vulnerability.====To address this situation, the government has established an ambitious economic and social program called the “Plan for an Emerging Senegal” (PES). The program aims to transform the structure of the economy by improving the productivity of current growth drivers, human capital and local governance. The transformation of the economy involves the creation of infrastructures that encourage investment in key productive sectors (for example, agriculture) and services and the improvement of business environments.====The agricultural objective of the PES is to increase productivity and improve the competitiveness of this sector. However, the achievement of these objectives will depend on several prerequisites, such as water management, improving the quality of the soil and the modernization of farming tools. To achieve these goals, the Senegalese government intends to make specific public investments in the agricultural sector. These policies should not only increase and diversify agricultural production but also improve the competitiveness of the sectors. Furthermore, the Senegalese government expects improvements in the agricultural sector to lead to increased job creation, which will in turn have a positive impact on household consumption through increased incomes.====Therefore, the PES should have a positive impact in reducing poverty. Similarly, given that women are mainly involved in agricultural activities, their incomes are likely to increase. Indeed, the distribution of female employment by sector shows that women are mainly active in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounts for 46.40% of the female workforce (ANSD, 2013). In addition, 15.3% of female heads of household work in the agricultural sector. Women also cultivate 31.9% of agricultural land in urban areas and 23% of the land in rural areas. The development of the agricultural sector could therefore increase women's incomes and levels of self-sufficiency.====This study aims to evaluate the effects of two public policies targeting the agricultural sector on growth, employment (notably women’s employment), poverty and inequality. Specifically, our study focuses on the impacts of two scenarios: (i) an increase in public subsidies for investment in the agricultural sectors and (ii) an increase in production subsidies for the agricultural sectors. For this assessment, we use a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model linked to a microsimulation model. We believe that CGE models are the most appropriate tools to capture the interrelations between production activities, labor markets, and the generation of incomes for agents, notably households. The resulting macroeconomic framework makes it possible to consider the impact on the whole economy and on different agents, such as the government. This dynamic dimension allows us to capture the Senegalese government's multiyear plan and the long-term effects of this policy. The use of a micro model allows us to assess the impact of simulated policies on household poverty (a macro model alone would not allow for such an analysis).====Several studies provide information on the role that agriculture can play in reducing poverty and inequality. Indeed, by employing more of the population than any other sector in many developing countries, agriculture remains a lever of choice to reduce inequalities and poverty (Diao, Hazell, & Thurlow, 2010). However, for several researchers, such as Mellor (1996) and Gollin (2010), the agricultural sector can only be a real asset for development if it undergoes profound transformations in transitioning from traditional to modern agriculture. This transformation requires capital investment to stimulate production and facilitate commercialization (Adelman, 2001).====For Pinstrup-Andersen and Shimokawa (2007), improving agricultural productivity requires not only the construction of irrigation systems, the adoption of new farming practices or the financing of inputs to improve agricultural yields and ensure quality production. Rather, the authors also emphasize the importance of the creation of physical infrastructures such as roads, storage areas, markets, and so on to improve producers’ access to markets. This view is shared by Fan, Hazell, and Thorat (2000), who report that in India, the increase in public investment in agricultural research and development and in equipment has led to an increase in yields. Farmers' incomes have in turn increased, leading to a reduction in poverty and inequality. Again, in India, Baba, Saini, Sharma, and Thakur (2010) show that the combined increase in private and public investment in the agricultural sector between 1969 and 2002 stimulated economic growth. However, the unequal redistribution of wealth did not significantly reduce poverty during this period. This study highlights that in addition to the efforts made to increase agricultural production, special attention must be paid to income redistribution. Without a fair redistribution of wealth, poverty and inequality are likely to persist.====Sennoga and Matovu (2013) conclude that public resources directed to sectors that can serve as a base for transferrable skills and that can support the broad-based expansion of economic capacities of both individuals and firms can lead to improved productivity and effectively combat poverty. The authors analyze the Ugandan case and conclude that a reallocation of public resources from nonproductive sectors (e.g., public administration and security) to agriculture as a productive sector leads to a reduction in poverty. This outcome is made possible by strong farming sector linkages within other industries. Benin et al. (2007) reached similar conclusions through their analysis of Uganda’s agricultural modernization plan. In the authors’ view, without the proper integration of the agricultural sector into the rest of the economy, increased investments in the sector will not have a significant impact on the economy as a whole. These findings show that the integration of the agricultural sector into the rest of the economy influences the amplitude of the resulting impacts on growth, poverty and inequality.====Mogues, Yu, Fan, and McBride (2012) note that investment in the agricultural sector can play a key role in economic development through two channels: by improving people’s health and by improving their incomes. According to the authors, investment in agriculture can lead to improved productivity and can improve farmers’ resources. Additionally, such investments lead to a reduction in product prices, which can result in an increase in household purchasing power. Stifel and Randrianarisoa (2006) have shown in the case of Madagascar that agricultural reforms favoring the reduction of the interseasonal price of agricultural products and of the urban-rural market margin reduce poverty reduction. This is made possible when agricultural reforms are based on investments made in agricultural infrastructure, such as storage warehouses and irrigation devices. Although the decline in poverty has affected all households, rural households have benefitted the most, as they are mainly employed in agricultural sectors and have experienced an increase in their income through this reform. In addition, the fall in the prices of agricultural products, which are mainly consumed in rural areas, has led to an increase in the purchasing power of these households.====The studies presented above demonstrate that several tools can be used to improve the agricultural sectors. Depending on these tools, the impact of agriculture reforms on household welfare can vary. In analyzing the impact of agriculture reforms on welfare, Jonasson, Filipski, Brooks, and Taylor (2014) found in reference to Ghana and Malawi that the impacts on households are different depending on whether a reform adopts a subsidy (input price or production subsidy) or a cash transfer, for instance. Although the results differ across countries, the authors conclude that investment policy through input subsidies has the strongest effects on welfare gains. However, this is only the case when input prices do not increase. Matchaya (2020) confirmed this general conclusion in reference to Malawi, Swaziland, and Zambia by demonstrating that increasing investment within agricultural sectors in terms of research and development and production subsidies is key to improving agricultural performance and the agricultural contribution to GDP growth. Irz, Lin, Thirtle, and Wiggins (2001) conclude that a 1% increase in agricultural GDP through public investment leads to an average 1.61% increase in income for the poorest quintile of the population in developing economies. Similarly, a 1% increase in agricultural productivity in developing countries leads to a reduction in the poverty head count ratio of between 0.62% and 1.3%.====Concerning Senegal, Boccanfuso, Cabral, Cissé, Diagne, and Savard (2007) evaluate the impacts of a 10% increase in agricultural productivity on poverty using a static CGE model including a multihousehold model. This methodological approach allows the authors to carry out a more detailed analysis of poverty situations. The authors find an interesting result: The effect of increasing agricultural productivity seems to mainly benefit urban households even though the policy was originally aimed at reducing poverty in rural areas. The authors attribute this result to sources of income for poor rural households decreasing and to the increase in agricultural productivity leading to a reduction in prices, which benefits net buyers but disadvantages net sellers.====Most studies that use a CGE model and incorporate a gender dimension address the impact of trade liberalization on gender (Chitiga et al., 2010, Cockburn et al., 2007, Fontana and Wood, 2000, Latorre, 2016). Few studies address the gender impacts of agricultural policies. Arndt, Jensen, Robinson, and Tarp (2000) show that an improvement in agricultural productivity through the incorporation of new production technologies leads to an increase in farmers’ incomes in Mozambique. Additionally, since women in Mozambique are more heavily engaged in agriculture than men, their incomes increase more significantly as a result, which reduces female poverty and women’s dependence on men and reduces gender disparities in terms of income.====Zidouemba, Kinda, Nikiema, and Hien (2018) analyze effects of the transformation of agriculture on the economic situation of women in Burkina Faso. With the help of a CGE model, the authors show that an increase in investment in agricultural capital has positive effects on employment in general and especially for women. This improvement in employment opportunities positively impacts women’s incomes and enables a reduction in gender disparities in terms of jobs and revenue.====Cockburn, Corong, Decaluwé, Fofana, and Robichaud (2010), following Annabi, Cissé, Cockburn, and Decaluwé (2008), use a sequential dynamic CGE model with microsimulations to analyze the effects of trade liberalization on poverty and gender disparities. The authors’ simulations reveal that rural households benefit more from the liberalization process than urban residents. Regarding gender, the authors find an increase in gender pay disparities, as liberalization is more profitable for sectors that use more male labor. Male-headed households in turn experience much lower less poverty than households headed by women. Thus, while liberalization leads to increased economic growth, this increase reinforces wage disparities as well as differential access to jobs among men and women.====Our study may shed light on the impact of agricultural sector reforms on women's employment, economic growth, poverty and inequality in Senegal and may further fuel the public debate under the PES framework that is currently taking place.","Agricultural economic reforms, gender inequality and poverty in Senegal",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000151,29 March 2022,2022,Research Article,76.0

Different factors such as household income, household size, fuel price, and information spread have been identified as barriers to the widespread uptake of clean cooking systems. However, analyses exploring the dynamic influences of these factors towards accelerating clean cooking from the long-term perspective are limited. Here, we employ a system dynamics modelling framework to simulate how various strategies could affect the adoption of clean cooking systems in Nigeria over time. Our results reveal that clean cooking adoption is a fluctuating process, and the trends present a non-linear behaviour. We found that the adoption of clean cooking energy systems would occur faster early in the simulating year among urban households than in rural households. The results indicate that, at low prices of liquefied petroleum gas, many rural households will switch to clean cookstoves with higher adoption rates than consumers in urban households. Additionally, results from baseline scenario analysis revealed that, without significant policy interventions, not all households would switch to clean cooking. Our analysis further indicates that households with fewer members tend to transition quicker to clean cooking options than larger households. The impact of clean cooking due to communication among households would be more significant among rural households than among urban households. While the model results are perceptive, we emphasise that potent policies are needed to accelerate the diffusion and adoption of clean cooking energy systems in Nigeria and other African countries.","Within the last two decades, various international development agencies, national and local governments, and private sector entities have been working together to improve the diffusion of clean cookstoves and modern fuels among households (Hewitt, Ray, Jewitt, & Clifford, 2018). These efforts are yet to deliver the much-needed results in terms of pace and scale, as both the adoption and the continuous use of modern cooking facilities remain low among households (IEA, 2020). Furthermore, the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has severely limited investment in modern energy systems, thereby pushing countries further away from achieving universal access to clean cooking. If the current trend is not improved, by 2030, clean cooking will still elude about 2.3 billion people, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (IEA, 2017). This scenario shows that the challenge of clean cooking is not equally distributed worldwide. Specifically, rural areas in South America, developing Asia, and SSA are the mostly affected (Bonan, Pareglio, & Tavoni, 2017).====Complexities exist as nations transition to clean cooking energy systems (Kumar, Chalise, & Yadama, 2016) because the systems exhibit unpredictable behaviours as they evolve. Complexities are predominant in the energy sector of emerging economies, primarily due to the dearth of data, lack of infrastructure, weak policy and institutional frameworks, inconsistent implementation of policies and legislation and socio-cultural practices (Jagger et al., 2017). These challenges have affected planning towards evolving energy systems and transition pathways relating to the techno-socio-economic dynamics of emerging nations. Ensuring access to clean cooking in all households in developing countries in the near future will require robust policy reforms (Dioha & Kumar, 2020a). Aside from financing issues, one of the critical obstacles limiting the massive transition to a clean cooking energy system in developing countries is the lack of proper knowledge on the complexities surrounding its diffusion.====This study has taken a closer look at Nigeria – a developing country and the most populous and largest economy in Africa (Dioha and Kumar, 2020b, Dioha, 2020). Despite the plethora of energy resources in the country, about 90% of Nigerian households still depend on traditional inefficient cookstoves for their domestic thermal energy needs (Dioha & Emodi, 2019). The Nigerian government aims to provide its citizens with clean cooking equipment (FGN, 2016). However, such an ambitious goal needs to be informed by a thorough understanding of the complexities surrounding the transition to clean cooking energy systems. Despite decades of existence and experience, the Nigerian energy sector still grapples with ensuring adequate clean cooking systems in urban and especially in the rural areas, thus, suggesting the need for better adoption of clean cooking by the larger population.====Various scholars have inquired into the factors that influence the transition to clean cooking energy systems (Ateba et al., 2018, Bisu et al., 2016, Danlami et al., 2018, Debbi et al., 2014, Makonese et al., 2018, Mensah and Adu, 2015, Nyankone, 2018, Paudel et al., 2020, Rahut et al., 2019, Sana et al., 2020, Soltani et al., 2019). A large percentage of these studies recognised household-level factors such as household size, level of education, household income, geographical location, fuel availability, the gender of household head, and change of seasons (Bisu et al., 2016, Debbi et al., 2014, Soltani et al., 2019, Danlami et al., 2018, Ozoh et al., 2018, Dagnachew et al., 2019, Vigolo et al., 2018). However, a critical assessment of the literature shows that studies employing system dynamics approach towards assessing the nature of clean cooking energy transition are scanty. Also, majority of the studies employ econometric models and survey results to assess the factors affecting clean cooking transition without considering the implications and feedbacks from the long-term perspective.====Here, we aim to advance the frontiers of clean cooking energy transition research by exploring how various factors could influence the transition to a clean cooking energy system using Nigeria as a case study. In this context, we develop and simulate the adoption of clean cookstoves, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), as a modern fuel using the system dynamics Bass diffusion model. LPG is considered a proxy for cooking fuel in the study because of its low emission factors with insignificant impact on health and its significant penetration in the Nigerian household sector. At this juncture, it is worthwhile to state that we do not intend to predict or forecast the evolution of clean cooking adoption in Nigeria. A different and more pertinent purpose of this study is to generate a high-level understanding of how clean cooking energy transition could occur from the long-term perspective in Nigeria.====We introduce one of the earliest case studies on clean cooking energy transition based on a system dynamics model. In the is study, we have embraced a system dynamics modelling approach that allows the exploration of clean cooking energy transitions from the long-term perspective instead of the conventional economic modelling frameworks. Owing to the dichotomy of energy use in the household sector of developing countries like Nigeria, our study accounts for spatial heterogeneity by splitting the households into rural and urban classes. We took a step further by also providing policy implications of our analysis. We believe that our analysis and findings will inform existing knowledge on clean cooking fuels transition in Nigeria and other developing countries.====Section 2 of this paper presents the study’s theoretical framework and methodology.

In December 2019, respiratory illness clusters due to a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, the capital city of the mainland Chinese Hubei Province. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). In addition to the global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an extraordinary disruption in economic activity and has transformed the fiscal outlook.==== The incentives to act quickly in the wake of this crisis have been substantial. Fiscal policy has been highlighted as the best available policy response tool (====After these initial emergency aid programmes, the question of how to rebound economies and stimulate aggregate demand has taken centre stage. Overturning years of fiscal orthodoxy and the so-called ‘black zero’ policy, the German government announced on 3 June 2020 a stimulus package worth EUR 130 billion. This followed a EUR 123 billion supplementary budget passed in March 2020. The centrepiece of the policy was a temporary VAT tax rates cut for six months, from 1 July to 31 December 2020. The regular VAT rate was reduced from 19% to 16%, and the reduced VAT rate from 7% to 5%.==== The aim was to create a future path for increasing VAT taxes by stimulating aggregate demand today.====Upon what does the effect of the adopted VAT tax measure depend? First of all, the economic impact depends on the extent to which the VAT rates cut was passed on to consumers, thereby increasing their real income. The empirical literature shows that the tax incidence varies from sector to sector (====, ====). Moreover, the effect of VAT tax rate variations appears to be asymmetric. In particular, reductions in VAT tax rates are passed on to consumers to a lesser extent than increases (====). On 1 January 2012 the VAT rate for restaurants and catering services in Sweden was reduced from 25% to 12%. The ==== then determined an associated price pass-through of roughly 50%. Matching this, ==== employed register data from Swedish firms to show that the VAT tax rate reduction had a positive effect on restaurant turnover, employment, and proﬁt margins.====The first empirical study on the pass-through of the VAT tax rate reduction in the German fuel market was conducted by ==== observed an average price decline of about 2% in German supermarkets. These results indicate that the temporary reduction in VAT tax rates at supermarket checkouts was almost entirely passed on to consumers. Both aforementioned studies dealt with selected consumer goods. The first assessment of all goods and services in the CPI basket was presented by the ====, pp. 57–59). According to this, 60% of the temporary VAT tax rates cut has been passed on to consumers.====Furthermore, the efficiency of temporary tax rate cuts also depends on the strength of the substitution effect. Provided that the temporary measure is credible, consumers may bring forward their consumption (====, ====).====, ====). The empirical evidence on the temporary VAT rate reduction in the UK between 2008 and 2009 has revealed a resulting short-term economic stimulus, followed by a decline after the measure ended (====, ====). This is compatible with the postulated intertemporal shift in consumption.====Our work relates to recently published dynamic economic models analysing the effects of the fiscal response to the pandemic, including those of ==== using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model framework.

Following a fear of crime model we test for the effect of community context, disorder/safety, and victimization as the critical parameters of these perceptions and evaluations. Empirical estimations involve a cross-section dataset for Greece and multilevel model techniques. Results verify community context, disorder and victimization as important fear and integration predictors that interact with the socio-economic status of individuals and regional crime rates.","Contemporary multicultural societies place increased emphasis on respecting the fundamental rights of minorities and advancing their socio-economic integration. The Roma are the Europe’s largest ethnic minority of approximately 10 (to 12) million people, of which 6 million are citizens of the EU member countries. Furthermore, they are a heterogeneous minority population, involving many sub-groups with different specificities. Thus, the EU uses the term Roma as an umbrella notion to denote diverse groups of people including ‘==== [and] ====’ (EU-COM, 2020: 6).====The socio-economic integration of Roma and the promotion of their fundamental rights is a central pillar of the EU’s equal treatment policies (EU-COM, 2020). Similarly, Greece places increased emphasis on policies and measures to promote equality and the socio-economic integration of Roma (Gypsies) while respecting their ethnic identity, culture and traditions. The Greek Roma are of Indian origin (mainly from the Northwestern Indian state of Punjab), and their presence is manifested in the country since the 14th century (Chatzikonstantinou, 2012). They live dispersed in a number of geographical areas of the country with their bigger settlements located in Attica and Thessaloniki (Triantafyllidis, 2020). As a nomadic population Roma usually live in tent settlements that do not provide appropriate everyday living conditions. This is observed despite the local governments’ Roma relocation plans which in many cases fail either because the Roma do not wish to participate in the local community’s housing plan (e.g. in Thessaly) or because relocation was actually an attempt to force them out of trespassed land (evictions) without having an organized alternative housing plan (Management Organization Unit of Development Programs, 2015, Region of Thessaly, 2015).====The Greek Roma have obtained nationality in the early 1970s (Chatzikonstantinou, 2012) yet official data as to their exact number are not available. Estimates from different organizations vary significantly. The ROM.O network refers to 250,000 persons while the Greek Helsinki Watch raises their number to 300,000–350,000 people (Divani, 2001). The Greek government reports significantly lower numbers. In celebrating the 2019 International Romani Day (April 8), the efforts of the Greek government to enhance the integration of Greek Roma by monitoring their 310 communities and addressing the needs of a population of 110,000 citizens, were mentioned (Laxouri, 2019). The World Bank estimates an average population of 175,000 Roma accounting for 1.55% of the country’s total population (EC, 2013). The majority of the Roma population are Orthodox Christians and speak the Vlachoura-Roma language (apart from Greek) with the exception of the Western Thrace Roma who are Muslims and speak the ‘na-Vlachoura-Roma’ dialect (and Greek) (Divani, 2001).====In the case of Greece extant knowledge reports the long-standing presence of negative stereotypes with regard to the Greek Roma minority while segregation and a growing divergence from the majority population is also present (Close, 2012). Roma are most often victims of prejudice, discrimination, and/or hostility owing to their living (housing) conditions (tent dwellers in occupied land settlements with no sanitary standards), occupational choices (occasional/unstable occupation, and high rates of crime and illegal activities), values and traditions (hostile and antagonistic tribes), low educational levels (high levels of illiteracy and high school dropout levels), high percentages of child labor (and abuse), lack of respect for law and order, etc. (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), 2015, European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), 2016). In a recent EU cross-country survey of Roma stigmatization and prejudice it is reported that 53% of Greeks have negative attitudes towards the Roma population (Pew Research Centre, 2014).====According to Parthenis and Fragoulis (2016), the persistent social and educational exclusion of Roma people in Greece is the outcome of two main factors, namely, the negative social dispositions towards Roma, on the one hand, and the inadequate state policies, on the other. These are the boundaries of the country’s struggle against a bipolar ‘conceptual map’ (Tremlett, Messing, & Kóczé, 2017) about Roma that influences the construction of stereotypes. This bipolar conceptualization relates to what Kóczé and Rövid (2017) describe as the politics of ‘double discourse’ with regard to the treatment of Roma in contemporary European policy level. Using Roma 'child theft' in Greece and Ireland as an example they argue, that the challenge of Roma integration in the European member states is subject to contradictory political discourses that aim to promote integration, respect of fundamentals rights and the equal treatment of the Roma while, neglecting the enduring (and rising) phenomena of structural violence and social insecurity (Kóczé & Rövid, 2017).====Here, we adopt a social identity model and analyze the majority’s perceptions about Roma with regard to fear and integration. We argue that fear of Roma relates to peoples’ everyday living conditions and intervene with the majority’s attitudes towards their integration. Using a country level dataset of 1014 observations we analyze fear of Roma (socio-cultural threat and crimes) and integration (schooling and economic support) attitudes as dependent upon disorder, victimization and the community context. Our findings verify the role of these parameters in sustaining the limits between the two communities (majority Greeks and the Greek Roma minority) and the majority’s reluctance to approve increased economic support (allowances) to Roma population. The presence of an ‘us’ and the ‘others’ division is also reported in terms of the socio-demographic and economic profile of respondents and its effect on fear from, and integration of, Roma. State integration policies ought to acknowledge the existence of these limits and place increased emphasis on alleviating fear through more efficient crime prevention measures. On the other hand, support policies through mainly financial allowances should be (re)evaluated in terms of their efficacy in view of increasing (decreasing) the majority’s potential support (or tolerance) for them.====The study is organized as follows. Following this introduction part, Section 2 provides background knowledge on a) the EU and state level Roma integration policies, and b) on the relationship between fear of crime and social inclusion. The study’s hypotheses are then presented following a brief presentation of the ongoing challenges related to the integration of the Roma minority in the Greek society. Section 3 presents the method of analysis, and the data and variables used. Section 4 presents the results of the study and Section 5 concludes the study.",Fear of crime and Roma integration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016189382200014X,29 March 2022,2022,Research Article,79.0

However, there has never been a coordinated action to address the problem on the global level. Covid-19 virus pandemic is world’s largest public health problem currently.

We determine that obesity is single largest and most common cause of mortality in Covid-19 patients globally based on a sample of 171 countries, while economic variables have no impact. This creates an opportunity to finally address the obesity global epidemic through an effort coordinated on the global level.","Obesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat (====). The World Health Organization (WHO) described obesity as a global epidemic more than twenty years ago (====). The problem remains as continuous global increase of obesity did not subside. In 2016, more than 1.9 billion or 39% of adults aged 18 years and over (39% of men and 40% of women) were overweight (====). Of these, over 650 million adults were obese. That translates into about 13% of the world’s adult population (11% of men and 15% of women) were obese in 2016. In addition, over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 and an estimated 38.2 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight or obese in 2016 (====). Global epidemic implies that the problem exists on all continents and in almost all countries, with a few exceptions in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia (====). It has been long hypothesized and confirmed that globalization is a major contributor to spreading of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases globally (e.g., ====; ====; ====). If we understand globalization as a process by which national/regional economies, societies and cultures have become integrated through a global network of economic, technological, socio-cultural, political and biological factors (====), rather than the trade liberalization only, the possibility of its resulting externalities, including increasing rate of obesity, rises significantly (====).====Overweight and obesity are major causes of many comorbidities which can lead to further morbidity and mortality. For example, increased overweight and obesity have been associated with increased death rates for all cancers combined and for cancers at multiple specific sites (====). Furthermore, increasing body mass index (BMI), as a standard measure of obesity in adults, is associated with glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, kidney failure, and osteoarthritis (====). Moreover, all degrees of obesity are associated with asthma, heart failure, and severe mental disorders. Type II and morbid obesity are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and depression (====).====The WHO has declared the novel coronavirus SARS-COVID-19–2 (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (====). The virus has wreaked havoc worldwide, bringing the life we know to almost a halt. Studies to date show that advanced age and the presence of one or more underlying health conditions are risk factors for increased severity of the disease (====). Many of the underlying conditions considered as the risk factors for increased mortality due to COVID-19 are ones and the same as the comorbidities associated with increased obesity and overweight (====; ====).====We empirically test and demonstrate in this paper that higher obesity rates indeed cause an increase in mortality rates in those infected by COVID-19 globally. Moreover, we also demonstrate that, on global level, high obesity rates are the primary cause of higher mortality rates due to COVID-19. This also holds true across all COVID-19 mortality rate quantiles and after controlling for several other comorbidities or exogenous factors. As obesity is a non-contagious disease, it has always been difficult to establish international standards on how to address the problem. Considering findings on causal linkage between obesity and COVID-19 mortality, we propose more wholistic policies to combat global obesity with the goal to decrease comorbidities and mortality rates associated with both obesity and COVID-19.",The link between the two epidemics provides an opportunity to remedy obesity while dealing with Covid-19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000114,29 March 2022,2022,Research Article,80.0

The nationwide lockdown imposed in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic is used as a benchmark. However, the adopted approach allows an ex-ante assessment of alternative policy responses, in the event of successive pandemic waves, in order to rationalise the policy intervention and reach the best possible compromise between containing the risk of contagion and reducing economic losses. The used approach consists of a non-linear programming model based on a multiregional Input-Output (I-O) table, which guarantees greater flexibility than traditional I-O analysis. It is applied to estimate both direct and indirect losses of GDP and employment produced by alternative policy responses represented by general and differentiated lockdowns. The evidence deriving from the Italian experience shows a sort of ==== through successive waves based on the introduction of increasingly flexible and tailored policy responses to the pandemic.","With many countries entering the fourth wave of the SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic, the respective governments are still struggling to achieve the best possible compromise between two conflicting needs: introducing restrictions to contain the sanitary risk and minimising the economic losses of these restrictions. The often-drastic initial policy response has been progressively adjusted and fine-tuned across the subsequent waves of the pandemic. In fact, this adjustment is still ongoing in order to take into account new developments, such as virus variants and vaccination, as well as the increasing amount of knowledge and expertise accumulated over the previous waves.====Although different models of rationalisation of the policy response have been proposed and adopted, these models are mostly oriented towards the public-health side of the dilemma, that is, the modelling of the spread of the contagion. A detailed representation of economic losses, and of their intersectoral and geographical spread, remains largely disregarded. This paper aims to propose a modelling approach that fills this gap in order to provide decision makers with a suitable tool for taking more targeted decisions in subsequent pandemic waves.====The used approach consists of a constrained non-linear programming (CNLP) model based on a multiregional I–O (MRIO) table. The impacts of restriction measures are computed in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) loss, employment loss and reduction of the risk of contagion in the workplace. By capturing the intersectoral and interregional linkages within the economy, this approach has two main advantages. The first concerns the measurement of direct and indirect effects of the containment measures. Disregarding the indirect effects can misrepresent the real impact of restrictions as well as their distribution. The measurement of these effects together with the direct ones reshapes the controversial trade-off between the reduction of the risk of infection and the minimisation of economic losses, and leads to the second, and more important, merit of the proposed modelling approach. The model is conceived following a decision-making logic since it allows an ex-ante evaluation of the overall impacts of alternative restriction policies. The options analysed in this study consist both in a general lockdown, involving sectors considered as non-essential, and in differentiated and partial closures at sectoral and regional levels to take into consideration the different specificities. The comparison between the corresponding impacts provides information on the possibility of ensuring the same risk reduction by imposing differentiated restrictions that contain the economic loss.====This modelling approach uses the Italian Government's response to the first wave of spring 2020 as a benchmark. Italy was the first Western country to confront with this unexpected event and the first policy reaction was to introduce radical lockdown measures with consequent large economic costs. The adequacy of this political response has been (and still is) at the core of the political debate in Italy. This debate has led to a gradual change in the government’s strategy. With the second wave (October-November 2020), a more flexible approach was adopted by applying constraints more suited to specific sectoral and, above all, regional conditions. However, this policy response was not based on any dedicated modelling toolkit. Therefore, the proposed approach and its results can provide useful suggestions to any decision maker in terms of more tailored mitigation strategies. Although this study focuses on the Italian case, the modelling approach can be transferred to other countries through appropriate adjustments, which include the construction of the corresponding MRIO table.====The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. ==== examines the policy issue as well as recent literature on the subject. ==== details the adopted modelling approach, the way alternative policy responses are modelled, and the data used. ==== reports and compares the direct and indirect impacts at sectoral and regional level generated by these alternative policies. ==== discusses potential applications of the approach and validates the results. ==== provides some policy advice and implications and concludes indicating a few future research directions.",Policy responses to COVID-19 pandemic waves: Cross-region and cross-sector economic impact,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893822000187,2 April 2022,2022,Research Article,81.0

In the economic analysis, the price of oil is one of the fundamental variables used to gauge the dynamics of inflation due to its influence on the cyclical variations of inflation in oil-importing countries (Blanchard and Gali, 2007, Forbes et al., 2018). Changes in the price of oil not only have a direct impact on inflation through the price of energy products but also generate indirect effects when they alter inflation expectations or when wages and capital are indexed to past inflation (Álvarez, Hurtado, Sánchez, & Thomas, 2011; Peersman & Van Robays, 2009).====Traditionally, the ECB has been very sensitive to changes in inflation caused by oil price shocks. Examples of this are its actions in July 2008 when, during the period of liquidity problems in the interbank market prior to the financial crisis, the ECB raised the reference rate by 25 basis points in response to soaring oil prices that reached 132 dollars per barrel; and when, in the midst of the euro area sovereign debt crisis, the interest rate was increased by 50 basis points due to the rise in inflation caused by commodities, including oil, even though core inflation was below the 2% target (Rostagno et al., 2019). These two examples, together with numerous statements by governors in relation to this issue (Trichet, 2006, 2007, 2008; Draghi, 2016) show the sensitivity of the European monetary authority to the inflationary pressures caused by fluctuations in the price of oil; hence, the importance of studying all the factors that affect the relationship between the price of oil and inflation.====The transmission of oil price shocks to inflation depends on several factors, such as the source of the oil price shock (Kilian, 2009, European Central Bank (ECB), 2011), the phase of the business cycle (Donayre and Wilmot, 2016) or the inflationary environment in which the economy finds itself (Sekine, 2020; Garzon and Hierro, 2021). One of the factors affecting the relationship between the price of oil and inflation that has not been studied is the possible indirect effect through the impact of oil price changes on the exchange rate. If increased oil prices trigger a hike in the dollar, the effect on inflation would be amplified by the depreciation of the local currency, and vice-versa. Should the dollar depreciate vis-à-vis the local currency, the impact on inflation would be attenuated. Recent literature finds a positive relationship between the price of oil and the euro/dollar exchange rate (Reboredo, 2012; Thalassinos and Politis, 2012; Reboredo et al., 2014; Thurham et al., 2014), such that this dampening effect may be occurring in the euro area. Indeed, given that oil is traded internationally in dollars, any appreciation of the euro against the dollar will reduce the increase in the price of oil in euros. The impact of oil prices on inflation would thus be lower than if the exchange rate remained unchanged. In addition, an appreciation of the exchange rate generated by the increase in the price of oil may reduce the price of other imported goods invoiced in dollars, thereby generating deflationary pressures on these goods, which would also cushion the initial effect triggered by the rise in oil price.====Although many studies have explored the relationship between the price of oil and the exchange rate of different currencies (see Beckmann, Czudaj, & Arora, 2020 for a survey), its implications for the transmission of oil prices to inflation and for the implementation of monetary policy have received little attention. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by examining the role played by the relationship between the price of oil and the exchange rate in the transmission of oil price changes to inflation in the euro area. This is key to correctly designing monetary policy reaction to oil price shocks.====Figure. 1 displays the evolution of the dollar/euro exchange rate and the Brent oil price, showing the positive relationship between the two variables mentioned above, such that an increase in the price of oil is accompanied by an appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar. This singularity is even more relevant if we take into account that studies exploring the relationship between oil price and the German mark’s exchange rate, the strongest legacy currency of the euro, found a negative relationship between them, such that the mark depreciated in the face of a rise in international oil prices (Amano and Norden, S., 1998aa, Chaudhuri and Daniel, 1998, Chen and Chen, 2007). The same result is also found in Clostermann and Schnatz (2000), who analyse the relationship between oil prices and the exchange rate of a synthetic euro, built from the weighted values of the legacy currencies of the euro before its introduction.====The aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the role of the exchange rate in the transmission of oil prices to inflation in the euro area and to test whether the single European currency has benefited or suffered in terms of the effect on inflation since its creation. For this purpose, based on an augmented Phillips curve framework, including oil price variations, we estimate the impact of the euro/dollar exchange rate on oil price-inflation pass-through using two complementary specifications: first, converting international oil prices into domestic currency, such that its fluctuations include contemporary exchange rate movements; and second, including the euro/dollar exchange rate in the augmented Phillips curve together with oil price fluctuations in dollar terms so as to control for the effects of exchange rate movements on inflation. Finally, we statistically compare the pass-through coefficients to test whether significant differences emerge when including the euro/dollar exchange rate. In addition, in order to consider the possibility of a time-varying relationship, we estimate the Phillips curve through rolling regressions. For comparative purposes, we also estimate the same specifications for the United Kingdom and Japan, two economies with highly internationally traded currencies (BIS, 2019) like the euro, and which therefore might have experienced a similar relationship with regard to oil prices.====The results obtained for the period spanning from 1999Q1 to 2019Q3 show that the euro/dollar exchange rate fluctuations have dampened oil price pass-through into the inflation rate. Thus, variations in the euro/dollar exchange rate are seen to have reduced the impact of oil prices on inflation in the euro area by around 15% during the period studied. Furthermore, this effect has been maintained throughout the period analysed, although it has intensified over time. These results contrast with those found for the United Kingdom and Japan, where no significant relationship was found to exist in terms of movements in their currency exchange rates vis-à-vis the dollar in oil price transmission to inflation.====These results have implications for monetary policy in the euro area. The ECB must consider the reaction of the euro/dollar exchange rate when quantifying the response of inflation to oil price shocks since, should it fail to do so, it might overreact, generating greater volatility in inflation and economic activity with its monetary policy decisions. At the same time, when the ECB analyses the response of inflation to fluctuations in the exchange rate in order to define its monetary policy stance, it must consider the source of the exchange rate fluctuation, in line with the recent literature on shock-dependent exchange rate pass-through (Shambaugh, 2008; Forbes, 2018), since if this is triggered by an increase in the price of oil, inflation will rise while the euro appreciates, showing a pass-through with the opposite sign to that expected after an exogenous exchange rate shock.====The remainder of the work is structured as follows: section 2 provides a review of the literature on the relationship between oil prices, exchange rates and inflation; section 3 explains the methodology and data used; section 4 presents the results, and section 5 discusses the implications for monetary policy, ending in section 6 with the main conclusions.","Inflation, oil prices and exchange rates.

These results bring a two-fold contribution: on the one hand, they may help us to understand differences and similarities among European countries during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and guide future quantitative or qualitative studies; on the other, our findings suggest that with minor exceptions (such as Sweden and Poland), different countries adopted very similar policy strategies, which are likely to be due more to the unfolding of the pandemic than to specific governmental strategies.","2020 is a year that will probably long be remembered for the pandemic that afflicted the world. In its first stages, most countries appeared substantially unprepared to address the issue and were forced to adopt exceptional measures to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. National policies based on so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were accompanied by an intense political debate at the international level regarding the best strategy to adopt. In the event, throughout 2020 countries followed various strategies to reduce the outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) and bring the epidemic under control. Political rhetoric from some national governments as well as anecdotal evidence==== praised the so-called Italian model to fight coronavirus, as opposed to the approach of other countries (====). One and a half years after the pandemic began, although some important conditions have changed, above all the availability of a number of different vaccines, several countries have continued to be forced to adopt severe NPIs.====While some articles in the literature have focused on the effectiveness of certain policies (for instance ==== and ==== on lockdowns; ====, on the policy mix in southeast Asia; ==== and ==== on policies aimed at closing schools), the fact that different approaches were put in place to counter the diffusion of the virus means that it is difficult to compare in a cross-country perspective the unfolding of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the measures adopted to face it.====Understanding the effectiveness of the different responses posed by various countries to COVID-19 seems essential if we are to establish the best route to emerge definitively from the pandemic. It may also be useful for future reference, or to help guide the choices of countries that are facing stages of the epidemic that other countries around the world have already passed. The issue is highly complex. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, even though governments around the world share the same policy objective, i.e. balancing the protection of citizens’ health with an easing of restrictions to favour spending and avoid excessive damage to economies and social spheres, no government has taken the same approach toward the epidemic through the various stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Although the pandemic has afflicted the entire world over the last year and a half, it has ebbed and waned in various places. In addition to institutional and political factors, national governments have modulated their policy interventions depending on the availability of more data on the unfolding of the outbreak, and the outcomes of policies adopted in other countries.====For all these reasons, it seems a daunting task to compare the effectiveness of the different remedies that have been adopted, since it is a problem involving several dimensions at once, for which scholars lack a reliable map. A spatial dimension is certainly involved, since the location of different countries plays a role, due to specificities in terms of climate, geographical borders and vicinity to severe COVID-19 outbreaks. But there is also a temporal dimension, given the fact that in different points of 2020 the virus had different levels of diffusion, leading to policies of varying degrees of stringency being put in place. Finally, there is a governmental dimension, involving the individual choices that each government decided to implement to pursue an optimal strategy for emergence from the epidemic. In this complex scenario, a synthetic map of all these peculiarities would be a useful tool for understanding how much governmental responses varied from country to country along spatial and temporal dimensions, and whether the mixture of policies adopted by each government depended on the evolution of the pandemic.====The aim of the present study is to describe and categorize the different approaches of the largest European countries in the fight against COVID-19. This operation could shed some light on the process that triggered different governments to choose and adopt a certain mix of measures. To do so, we adopt a multivariate approach based on ==== (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA), allowing us to model and group by similarity of reaction (in terms of containment measures imposed on citizens and social distancing policies implemented within national borders, as well as the severity of the growth of COVID-19 cases) the policies enforced by governments of the fourteen most populous European countries (those with more than 10 million inhabitants) during the first wave of COVID-19, i.e. between January and October 2020.====We use data from the Oxford University Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) dataset (====) about the unfolding of the infection rate and the policies put in place by different countries to combat the pandemic.====We think that mapping the response of the largest European states is an important issue, since future studies on the spread of COVID-19, as well as policy evaluations and case studies of remedies and intervention effectiveness, will necessarily require a simplification of the various moments of the first wave all over Europe, in order to distinguish and discriminate between the different situations in European countries during the months of the first COVID-19 wave.====Moreover, given that the pandemic is characterized by a non-linear evolution, so-called ‘waves’, the identification of models in countries’ behaviour during the first wave could be helpful also in providing some explanation regarding the consecutive waves that we have observed in the course of the pandemic. This point may also be useful from a theoretical perspective. Indeed, the methodology proposed in the paper allows us to understand whether certain policy mechanisms are at work when some countries, affected by the pandemic later than others, manage to exploit the advantage of observing the behaviour of countries affected earlier by the virus, in terms of NPI policy choices. On this particular point it is worth noting that, according to the literature, it is possible to detect two principal phenomena: policy diffusion when we are interested in the countries’ choices in term of NPI adoption, and policy convergence if we are interested in the evolution of the output of such policies over time.====From a policy perspective the present paper does not try simply to suggest a model for prediction, but instead offers a methodology that can be used to support the organization of complex information empirically. More specifically, the identification of policy models in the fight against COVID-19 may be a theoretical and empirical aid for conceiving and organizing appropriate policy responses to economic change – i.e. structural shifts, external shocks – and, generally, a support in the search for better socio-economic conditions.====To the best of our knowledge, the most similar approach is that of ====, who study the impact of NPIs on certain epidemiological variables. Nonetheless, while they also employ a PCA, they only consider 9 countries, and only distinguish between NPIs imposed before and after March 17 (only going up to 4 May), thus without considering the monthly mix of policies, and its change over time. The present contribution offers a longer timespan, and includes in its analysis the entire first wave of the pandemic (thereby including a whole period, from beginning to end, and offering the full spectrum of responses to the different stages of the pandemic). We thus consider ours to be an important step forward in mapping the responses of governments facing COVID-19 with NPIs and other policies, and a valuable contribution to the literature that traces and categorizes the different approaches adopted by the largest European governments, a matter of the utmost importance in the more general framework of policy modelling and evaluation (as highlighted by ====; ====).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: after the present introduction, Section ==== introduces the principal literature dealing with policy diffusion and policy convergence.

The results obtained demonstrate the capacity of Google Trends data associated with ,"Given the severe economic crisis and the sudden strong decline in economic activity, the unemployment variable is currently of particular interest to the general public and for scientists. The improvement of macroeconomic predictions has been a continuous concern of forecasters and policy-makers interested in proposing the best solutions in addressing the social and economic issues. The topic is the subject of current economic debates, marked by skepticism – enhanced by the recent global crisis and Covid-19 pandemic – regarding the predictive capacity of quantitative analysis.====The Covid-19 pandemic was an event beyond anticipated in rational expectations models, with phenomena that are never fully anticipated, and that have profound effects at the time and often for years to come (Stiglitz, 2021). It has exacerbated the unemployment issue and has determined increasing concerns related to a new global economic crisis (Arbolino & Di Caro, 2021). Numerous jobless people contribute to decrease in consumption and investment with direct effects on GDP. Therefore, the unemployment rate is one of the key macroeconomic indicators that could signal the beginning of an economic crisis. In this context, unemployment brings serious welfare issues like social exclusion and inequality. From these points of view, the unemployment evolution presents interest for policy makers, firms, and individuals, since this indicator shows the actual and near-future position of the economy. For these reasons, it is essential to correctly nowcast and forecast the unemployment rate to control its evolution, anticipate trend shifts and design the most suitable pro-employment policies (Mulero & García-Hiernaux, 2021). Moreover, more accurate unemployment forecasts allow the adjustment of GDP forecasts that are necessary to improve the economic decisions in business planning, selection of portfolio in finance, design of economic growth policies.====This paper is a contribution to the ongoing revolution in applied economic analysis. There is an ongoing change in economic analysis from official macroeconomic data released late to big data referring to on-line statistics with real-time data. In this context, this article is an application based on Google Trends tool that provides real-time data referring to job searches to forecast unemployment in Spain and Portugal. The utility of these forecasts is related to policy implications: the advantage to authorities of knowing what goes on in real time to anticipate future evolution of unemployment and the benefit in terms of better decision-making.====In general, the values of unemployment are released late and with revised values in time. A recent example is related to the Great Recession from 2008 when the official data did not anticipate from the very beginning the strength of the economic challenge. Consequently, there is a growing request for real-time data to anticipate the changes in unemployment (Fondeur & Karamé, 2013). In our opinion, this challenge might be addressed if we take into consideration the benefits of the digital economy based on a large amount of Internet data that could improve the forecasting process. The “future” of forecasting should take advantage of technological progress that could contribute to more accurate predictions.====The actual international context is favorable to this approach. Even if the Covid-19 pandemic has enhanced the unemployment issue, it has accelerated the digital transformation. Internet traffic increased about 15–20% in only a few weeks since the beginning of the epidemic (Feldmann et al., 2021) and job searches during the pandemic have increased in all the EU countries and the economic sentiment has deteriorated (van der Wielen & Barrios, 2021). The searches for jobs using the Internet grew by 30% during the lock-down in the EU-27 countries compared to the pre-pandemic period (Caperna, Colagrossi, Geraci, & Mazzarella, 2020). Therefore, we can conclude that the delay in releasing unemployment rate as a limit of current approaches is overcome by Internet data used to predict unemployment and explain the companies’ and labour force behaviour (Simionescu & Zimmermann, 2017). Our hypothesis is that unemployment rate forecasts for Spain and Portugal, countries with high unemployment, based on univariate models could be improved by using search indexes provided by GT. Once digitization of industry and businesses will be achieved as a goal of the European Digital Strategy, the predictive power of internet data will increase, ensuring better unemployment forecasts.====In this context, the main aim of the paper is to check if the unemployment rate forecasts based on Google Trends data improve the predictions based only on macroeconomic indicators that are released quite late. This objective of the research is achieved by conducting an analysis at national and regional level. Besides forecasts for national unemployment rate for Spain and Portugal, this paper brings as a novelty for literature the predictions of regional unemployment rate with quarterly frequency in Spain using Google Trends data. The regional analysis is limited only to Spain because of the lack of data availability for Portugal. Our hypothesis is checked for forecasts at both national and regional level for short horizons. The forecast methods are represented by autoreregressive moving average models for national data and dynamic panel data models for regional data. However, the research might be improved to consider longer horizons. These empirical findings confirm the previous results for Spain and Portugal from other studies and prove as novelty the capacity of Google Trends data to improve unemployment in Spanish regions.====After this introduction, the paper described the previous achievements from literature in this field. The next sections make a detailed description of data, methodology and results.

The findings reveal that these countries are yielding to the pressure on the trade sector. Unexpectedly, gross fixed capital formation shrink pollution, excluding in the mining sector. With findings supporting the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, policymakers must pay attention to FDI inflows, ensuring that FDI place high importance on the transfer of green technologies to improve the efficiency. These goals could be achieved through an increase in the stringency of environmental laws within the host countries, especially the ones related to FDI.","Global climate change had been a hot topic of discussion for several decades, with the main concern revolving around carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions. At the same time, phenomena such as globalisation, economic growth, and demographic boom have been linked to environmental degradation. Sustainable economic development should be a goal for all countries, and technologies must be allied to this task. According to UNESCO, the 2030 Agenda presents 17 objectives for sustainable development. To achieve these objectives, significant funding is needed. This is one of the biggest challenges facing countries fighting climate change—but foreign investors can be the sources of this capital.====Foreign investments present a dichotomous path for countries. On the one hand, there is the creation of higher-skilled jobs and the penetration of eco-friendly technology and innovation (UNCTAD, 2017). On the other hand, there is the relocation of pollution-intensive industries from countries with more restrictive environmental laws, to countries with laxer ones. Now that global warming is a world problem, this relocation does not represent any efficiency or environmental improvement, on the contrary, pollution will increase, and the changes that some countries have achieved become insignificant.====Analysing the impact that foreign direct investment (FDI) could have on the environment of host countries is the main focus of this investigation. FDI has different impacts depending on the economic sector under scrutiny because different sectors have different technology and innovation levels. This is the main reason for the analysis of the disaggregating FDI by sector to better understand the effect of FDI in these countries and to produce useful guidance for policymakers. Due to this, it intends to answers the following central questions: (1) What is the impact that inflow FDI has on the pollution level of the OECD countries?; (2) Does that impact differ from one sector to another?; (3) Are some countries transferring their pollution-intensive industries to the OECD countries?====To answer questions 1 and 3, the Autoregressive Distributed lag (ARDL) model was used, focusing on 15 countries which are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). To produce useful guidance for policymakers about this field, to better understand that policies should not be “one-size fits all”, and to answer question 2, three more ARDL models are executed, taking into consideration mining, manufacturing, and services FDI and their impact on CO==== emissions. This specialized analysis can help to fill the gap in the literature, because there is an analysis of the impact that FDI has on CO==== emissions jointly with an analysis of the effect that sectoral FDI has, upgrading with the differences between the impacts in the short- and long-run.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review; Section 3 outlines the data and the methodology; Section 4 reveals the results for the aggregated and disaggregated models; Section 5 exposes a discussion and a comparison between models, and Section 6 concludes.",Do greater amounts of FDI cause higher pollution levels?

However, despite this economic upturn, the region has continued to experience high levels of ==== growth and institutional quality on inequality and poverty reduction in West Africa. Using data from the World Development Indicators (WDI), the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) and the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID), our results show that economic growth remains a necessary condition for poverty reduction and that the overall improvement in the quality of institutions contributes significantly to reducing poverty and income inequality in the long term. This contribution is made in particular through the improvement of democratic institutions, the alleviation of bureaucratic constraints, the quality of the judicial and regulatory system, the control of ","Over the past two decades, the average sub-Saharan GDP growth was 5% per year. It is ranking as the fastest region around the globe. As a result of this dynamic growth, poverty rate has slightly declined to 56 in 1990 and 43% in 2015 (World Bank, 2018). But this decline is far below the target rate which was 28.2 and making Africa the region with highest poverty rates on earth (Senbet and Simbanegavi, 2017). Moreover, over the period 2000–2015, the number of extremely poor people increased by more than 100 million in this region (Barrett et al., 2017). Thus, the growth elasticity of poverty has been quite low in Africa due to high levels of inequality (Odusola, 2017). As long as unfair distribution of growth exists, the poverty alleviation will not be effective.====The West African region is in a similar situation as most countries in Africa in the south of Sahara. The West African region has experienced impressive economic growth over the past two decades. For instance, six of the ten fastest growing economies in Africa were in West Africa (Coulibaly, 2019, chp 2). However, in most countries, the benefits of this unprecedented economic growth have accrued to only a few people. Regional inequality has reached extreme levels in the region, nowadays the wealthiest population account for 1% in West Africa and they own the entire wealth within this region (Oxfam, 2019). While development indicators show a significant growth, income inequality is persistent, and the poor population is significantly growing. As a result, West Africa with the largest population in Africa, has the largest poor population accounting for 30%. These population live in extreme condition with $1.90 a day. This makes West Africa the poorest regional bloc in Africa.====These periods of high economic growth that have not translated into significant reductions in poverty and inequality in West African countries raise the question of why poverty and inequality still remain at such high levels in this region and are falling so rapidly in East Asian and Pacific countries. Numerous studies attempted to answer this question by looking for factors that may block or promote reduction (Avom and Carmignani, 2008). In this perspective, the work of Rodrik (2000), Adams (2004), Ravallion (2007, chp 2), Panagariya (2010) and Dollar et al. (2013), show that without rapid and sustained==== economic growth, there is little hope of significantly reducing poverty in poor countries. The evidence also supports his findings. Indeed, since 1950, the 13 economies==== considered successful in terms of poverty reduction have recorded economic growth of 7% or more over a period of at least 25 years.==== In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa and the Europe-Central Asia region have had the lowest growth and poorest poverty reduction performance (Lin, 2008).====On the other hand, alongside this argument that “sustainable growth is good for the poor”, some argues that economic growth can exacerbate income inequality and therefore impede the pace of poverty reduction (Ravallion and Chen, 2007). In other words, a country can have a high average growth rate without any benefits for the poorest households if income disparities have increased significantly, i.e. the rich have become richer while the incomes of the poor have stagnated or declined. This was the case for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) which despite a long period of relatively continuous and high growth rate and above the OECD average growth rate in the 2000s, became more unequal (Porras, 2015). It is well established in the economic literature that high inequality inhibits the positive effect of economic growth in reducing poverty (Thorbecke, 2013; Basu, 2013; Ncube et al., 2014; Fosu, 2016; Ostry et al., 2018).====Others argue that inefficient and failing institutions in African countries make these economies vulnerable and may explain their economic backwardness (Stiglitz, 2011). This highlights the importance of the institutional framework in the process of reducing poverty and inequality; the quality of institutions can even be seen as the primary determinant of poverty reduction. In this respect, we can mention the work of Dollar and Kraay (2000) and Ravallion and Chen (2003) who argue that in a good institutional policy environment, economic growth can reduce poverty. Also, the work of Acemoglu and Johnson (2005), recognises that poor institutions make activities unproductive, which in turn weakens long-term growth and worsens poverty. In contrast, efficient institutions enable society to move forward properly, by making their citizens more able to invest their time in productive activities. Countries can thus become richer by building institutions that are more efficient in quality. In the same vein, Knack and Keefer (1997) followed by Perera and Lee (2013), reveal that the situation of poor countries is worsening because of institutional failures. Indeed, these authors argue that the poor quality of institutions compromises the security of property rights. This uncertainty about property rights can discourage foreign investment and lead to lower economic growth, which in turn can lower the rate of poverty reduction. Gupta et al. (1998), have shown that the most corrupt countries are affected by sustained poverty and that anti-corruption strategies can reduce income inequality and poverty. The work of Chong and Calderon (2000a) and Chong and Gradstein (2007), reach the same conclusions.====The institutional issue thus has an undeniable relevance insofar as the failure of economic recovery in a context of underdevelopment can no longer be explained solely by economic factors, but also by non-economic factors, in particular the quality of institutions (North, 1981; Jones, 1981). By exploring this new avenue of research, it becomes possible to explain almost entirely the failures of developing countries (Keho, 2012). Thus, the most recent studies attempted to highlight the poverty-reducing effect of institutions (Perera and Lee, 2013). However, these analyses are rarely conducted on samples from developing countries such as those in West Africa. Yet, there are several reasons for investigating this issue in this region with a view to identifying policies that can be implemented to effectively address income inequality and poverty in this area. One of the main reasons for this is that the institutional environment in the West African sub-region has been marked by repeated socio-political crises, armed conflicts and unconstitutional changes, corruption and a host of governance problems that are not conducive to investment. For example, among the issues that occurred in the region, there are post-election crisis in Côte d'Ivoire in 2010/2011, the problem of insurgency in Nigeria with Boko Haram, the issues of terrorism in Mali and more recently in Niger and Burkina, the coups d'état in Guinea-Bissau, etc. These worrying situations have greatly weakened the institutions of the countries in this region==== (Ajide and Raheem, 2016).====These institutional weaknesses could therefore help explain the level of inequality and poverty in this region in several ways. In fact, it is recognised that countries in sub-Saharan Africa suffering from institutional weaknesses are generally characterised by persistent conflict and high levels of political instability, poor governance, insufficient and deteriorating physical infrastructure, low levels of human capital==== etc. All these structural and economic constraints that constitute deep characteristic of institutional fragility could explain the mixed effects of economic growth spillovers on poverty in sub-Saharan African countries in general and the West African sub-region in particular.====Another reason for conducting this research is that this issue has not been previously researched in the context of countries in the West African region. Institutional variables have been largely ignored in explaining outcomes in terms of poverty reduction and income inequality. This study fills this gap and adds to the empirical literature by examining the case of countries in the West African region.====Finally, from the perspective of economic policy, assessing the role of institutions in reducing poverty and inequality would quantify the risk that poor quality institutions pose to the achievement of development goals. The results of the study would thus provide a documented source of information on the real burden of the institutional environment on development efforts and would thus allow for a better consideration of this parameter in designing strategies to combat inequality and poverty in the area with high levels of inequality and poverty. The results of this study will guide policymaker’s actions.====To achieve these objectives, the study uses an estimation technique that is relatively efficient compared to the usual panel data methods. More precisely, we use the Pool Mean Group (PMG) method proposed by Pesaran et al. (1998). The advantage of this estimation method compared to the classical methods is that it introduces heterogeneity in certain coefficients to be estimated==== . Indeed, the PMG method reconciles in the same specification the routine approach imposing fixed coefficients and the one assuming country-specific coefficients. Thus, we can specify that the long-term relationship between the variables is identical for all countries but that each country follows its own dynamics to converge towards this common relationship. This assumption seems reasonable to us for the countries of the West African region that aim at the long-term convergence of their economies.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The second section briefly presents an overview of the existing literature. Section 3 deals with the methodology and variables used to conduct the study. The results of the estimations are analysed and discussed in Section 4.

By combining survey and administrative data with energy accounts and energy prices, we estimate the energy demand elasticity of Italian households and firms at the micro-level and we use this information to simulate the effects of four one-off carbon taxes (corresponding to €50, €100, €200 and €800 per ton of CO====) on their income and profits. To compute if (and how) carbon taxes might affect the share of financially vulnerable agents and the debt at risk, these estimates are employed as an input for the microsimulation models used to monitor financial stability at the Bank of Italy. According to our results, a level of carbon taxation within the range of €50−200 per ton does not have a sizeable effect on the share of financially vulnerable agents. The micro approach allows us to take into account the heterogeneous transmission channels of climate risks and indicates that the financial risks stemming from climate shocks are limited overall and specific to individual households and ====.","The effects of climate change constitute a possible threat to economic activity and the stability of the financial system. In addition, the policies to support the transition will have an impact on the economy and on financial institutions.==== Several governments have set ambitious climate targets, with nine of the ten biggest economies committed to net-zero goals (among them the UK, the EU, the United States and Japan, which have pledged to reach net carbon neutrality by 2050, while China has set up a similar goal for 2060). This translates into an unprecedented change in the way countries transform and use energy. The EU has been at the forefront of the climate debate and at the end of 2019, it pledged to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030 with 1990 as the base year.====Quantifying climate-related financial risks is however a challenging task. Indeed, at least in recent history, there have been no climate or environmental patterns whose implications are comparable with those for the future, which are then marked by high uncertainty, knock-on effects (endogeneity) and non-linearities (IPCC, 2014). Moreover, an evaluation at the individual intermediary level is a complex process, made even more difficult by the lack of detailed data on the exact geographical location, the economics or the carbon content of individual activities and assets (ECB, 2020). Finally, aggregating the estimated risks to assess the implications for the financial system as a whole requires making assumptions on how these risks propagate among intermediaries and on any amplification mechanisms – between connected sectors or countries and also including feedbacks from the financial system to the real economy – or on the effects of risk mitigants (such as insurance or other hedging strategies).====The academic world has been extensively investigating how climate change can affect the macro economy (see Batten et al., 2016; McKibbin et al., 2017; Campiglio et al., 2018; Campiglio & van der Ploeg, 2021) and how financial regulators should consider climate risks (among others, see Dikau & Volz, 2018; Schoenmaker, 2019; Bolton et al., 2020; Robins et al., 2021). In general, analyses of the impact of climate change over a medium- and long-term horizon can help central banks and supervisory authorities in understanding the possible implications for financial stability, but require making assumptions on the evolution of the markets farther into the future.====In this work, we present an alternative to the standard macro-based climate stress tests, by assessing the exposure of the Italian financial system to climate policy risks using a micro-founded approach. Our approach allows us to account for heterogeneity and, consequently, for the differential exposure of households and firms to a climate shock, which is identified as the introduction of a one-off carbon tax. Despite being one of the EU countries with the highest level of energy taxation, Italy has not explicitly introduced such a tax and, given its commitment to significantly reducing GHG emissions in the coming years within the EU Green Deal for Europe, it is a very suitable policy option on which to apply our stress test exercise. Specifically, we consider four possible carbon taxes, ranging from the current price level on the EU-ETS (€50) to an extreme one (€800), which corresponds to the value of the social cost of carbon (SCC, more on this later) in the event of a “Disorderly transition”; here, the transition is postponed, there are only a couple of decades left to achieve net-zero and this requires a strong price signal (NGFS, 2021). According to our results, the overall effect of carbon taxation on financial vulnerability is limited and mostly concentrated on firms. All in all, the exercise suggests that a climate shock would raise the vulnerability of both households and firms, but, even in the extreme case (€800), it would remain below the peak reached during the sovereign debt crisis. With this paper, we contribute to both the strand of the literature on micro-founded analyses of households and firms’ energy demand, including its reaction to price changes, and to the literature on the effect of carbon pricing on financial vulnerability.====More in detail, we start by estimating the energy demand (in energy units) and derive price elasticities for Italian households and firms, exploiting individual data. For households, we follow the methodology of Faiella and Lavecchia (2021), which uses the pseudo panel of the Italian Household Budget Survey (HBS)==== to estimate short- and long-run price elasticities for three different energy services (electricity, heating and private transport fuels). For firms, we exploit firm-level administrative data (from the Cerved database), integrated with Eurostat industry-level data on firms’ energy use, to estimate how energy demand changes as prices change. For both households and firms, the elasticities are estimated for different groups, exploiting most of the granular information available.====We then compute the energy price variations of each energy fuel corresponding to the carbon tax considered (using the carbon emission factors for each fuel). These variations are then translated into a policy shock using the estimated price elasticities. Each group of households and firms reacts according to its own energy mix and price sensitivities. This in turn changes the amount and the mix of energy demanded and affects their energy expenditure correspondingly. The change in energy expenditure then has an impact on the resources available after the introduction of the carbon tax: for households via a reduction in disposable income, for firms through a change in their EBITDA.====We finally feed the estimated changes in the available resources into the definitions and the set of models developed by the Bank of Italy to monitor financial vulnerability (Michelangeli and Pietrunti (2014) and Attinà et al. (2020) for households and De Socio and Michelangeli (2017) for firms). The mechanism is the following: by reducing disposable income for households and EBITDA for firms, a carbon tax could lead to an increase in financial vulnerability as the resources available to service the debt decrease. We compute the change in financial vulnerability driven by the carbon tax using the last year for which data are available as a benchmark (i.e. 2016 for households and 2018 for firms).====Our exercise matters for policy evaluations and recommendations as it relates with financial risks stemming from households as a consequence of a change in the fiscal policy. Here the main results.==== — Without carbon taxation, the shares of vulnerable households and of their debt (i.e. debt at risk) are equal to 1.6% and 10.3% respectively in the benchmark year. Introducing a carbon tax of moderate size (€50) implies an increase of 6 and 50 basis points respectively in the two variables. The highest carbon tax (€800) would raise the two indicators to 1.8% and 12.2%, far below the peak reached during the sovereign debt crisis, when the shares of vulnerable households and of their debt were equal to 2.8% and 19.4%. The households most exposed to the carbon tax are those with a younger reference person (aged 16−39), while the older and larger ones are less affected.==== — In the baseline scenario, the shares of vulnerable firms and of their debt equal 22.4% and 27.4% respectively in the benchmark year. A carbon tax of €50 would raise the two indicators to 32.5% and 30.3%. The impact of the shock is quite heterogeneous. In the baseline, the most vulnerable sectors in terms of debt at risk are construction and energy, whose vulnerabilities increase marginally after the introduction of a €50 carbon tax (by 3.6 and 0.8 percentage points). This tax would have a larger impact on the manufacturing sector, raising the debt at risk by about 5 percentage points, to 26.4%. With respect to the size, micro firms are the most vulnerable ones in terms of debt at risk and are the most exposed to our climate shock. Introducing an €800 carbon tax would raise the debt at risk of micro firms to 54%, a high level but still below the peak reached during the sovereign debt crisis (over 55%).====In our exercise, we only consider the instantaneous impact on households’ and firms’ vulnerability of a one-off introduction of a carbon tax. We abstract from a long-run assessment of the risks, as over time many forces can come into play to mitigate the effects (such as shifting to other activities or technologies) and the results may be subject to a high level of uncertainty. This is a serious limitation of the analysis, but it reduces the amount of hypotheses needed and makes the transmission channels for climate shocks clearer. For this reason, we plan to complement this analysis with a fully-fledged top-down exercise, where a more long-term perspective will be adopted and some adaption mechanisms will also drive the results.====All in all, our model can provides three main kinds of policy recommendations. First, it can be used for macroprudential purposes to identify which households and firms are more vulnerable in the baseline scenario and under scenarios of stress. Second, it informs policymakers showing the distributional impact associated with the introduction of a carbon tax. Third, it provides a modeling framework that can be followed by other countries, with the aim of strengthening comparability and interoperability of approaches to climate shocks.====The structure of the paper is the following. Section 2 presents an overview of the stress tests carried out so far by central banks to assess climate risks; Section 3 explains our choice to use an introduction of a carbon tax as a climate shock; Section 4 describes our data and methodologies for simulating the climate shock. Section 5 shows the set of models used to assess how the climate shock affects households’ and firms’ financial vulnerability; detailed results of the exercise are presented in Section 6.

This study therefore examines the dynamic connection among pollutant emission, energy use and real output per capita in SSA. Owing to cross-sectional dependence, the Prais-Winsten model with panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) alongside the panel spatial correlation consistent (PSCC) approach is applied and key findings are established. First, the ==== hypothesis holds and this is striking for both oil-rich and oil-poor SSA countries. Second, energy use induces pollutant emissions in oil-rich SSA countries but not in oil-poor SSA countries. Third, pollutant emissions and energy use are real output per capita-enhancing in SSA generally and in oil-poor countries. Thus, policy measures to safeguard efficient optimisation of energy use in ensuring a balance as well as developing SSA’s rich renewable energy sources is imperative for long-run growth.","Sub-Saharan Africa’s real growth and energy use per capita averages 3.0% and 612==== ====kW==== ====h respectively (UNEP, 2017). Policymakers within and outside the region considered these statistics very low to engender sustainable real GDP per capita growth in taking a significant number of the population out of the current worrisome poverty trap (UNEP, 2017). This has been a major policy concern especially considering recent global attention on the need for environmental sustainability via reduced pollution emission in the production process (Pal & Mitrab, 2017; Salmanzadeh-Meydani & Ghomi, 2019). While technological advancement is still low in the region, the source of energy for production process is seen to have serious policy implications for pollution emission (Ang, 2008). Thus, an empirical strategy to unravel the dynamic connection among energy use, pollutant emission and real output capita is considered plausible for policy advisory in the region’s oil-rich and oil-poor countries. Currently, global warming and climate change are “twin evils” becoming the greatest threats to human existence and survival in recent times (Acheampong, 2018; Adedoyin, Gumede, Bekun, Etokakpan, & Balsalobre-Lorente, 2020). However, pollution emissions have been identified as the primary source of global warming and climate change and this has attracted global concerns with respect to policies and programmes for mitigating pollution emissions (Adedoyin et al., 2020).====Similarly, it is estimated that the damage attributed to climate change as a result of pollution emission is about 5.0% of global GDP each year going forward and any delay of action will cause a climb of the statistics to 20.0% of GDP (Acheampong, 2018). It is therefore imperative to curb the current trend of pollution emissions globally but this invariably necessitate a reduction in energy use thus threating current global growth trajectories as energy is a crucial production input. These conflicting issues make policies and programmes focusing on spurring growth, energy use and pollution emissions to be at variance with each other (Acheampong, 2018; Nathaniel & Adeleye, 2021; Okoye et al., 2021).====The literature is replete with mixed and imprecise empirical results around four strands of literature. The first are studies focusing on the link between economic growth and emissions (Adeel-Farooq, Raji, & Adeleye, 2020; Ardakani & Seyedaliakbar, 2019; Hanif, Raza, Gago-de-Santos, & Abbas, 2019; Munir, Lean, & Smyth, 2020; Parker & Bhatti, 2020; Yazdi & Dariani, 2019) testing the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, the second strands focussed on the link between energy consumption and real output (Bekun, Emir, & Sarkodie, 2019; Eluwole, Akadiri, Alola, & Etokakpan, 2020; Nathaniel, Barua, Hussain, & Adeleye, 2020; Rahman & Velayutham, 2020; Salmanzadeh-Meydani & Ghomi, 2019; Soytas & Sari, 2006), the third strand of literature are on dynamic relationship among energy consumption, emission and economic growth (Adeel-Farooq et al., 2020; Ang, 2008; Chontanawat, 2020; Hdom & Fuinhas, 2020; Nepal & Paija, 2019; Mikayilov, Galeotti, & Hasanov, 2018; Mensah et al., 2019; Acheampong, 2018; Pal & Mitrab, 2017; Esso & Keho, 2016; Jafari, Othman, & Nor, 2012) and lastly, on the relationship between energy consumption and pollution emissions (Eluwole et al., 2020; Khan, Khan, & Rehan, 2020; Pandey, Dogan, & Taskin, 2020).====A cursory look at the literature showed that most studies that combined energy consumption, real output and emission adopted granger causality approach only to test the causality among the three variables. But, Acheampong (2018) argued on the need to combine two of the strands of literature (energy consumption and economic growth dynamics as well as energy consumption, economic growth and pollution emissions) in a proper empirical specification cum analysis as excluding any of the two will be missing important policy intuition in their dynamic connections. Ozturk and Saygin (2020) also pointed out that the behaviour of the relationship differs across countries. Surprisingly with the plethora of studies on these four strands, there is still dearth of studies especially in a panel of Sub-Saharan African countries examining the two strands in a single study with a view to gauging specific policy advisory. Thus, this study bridges this gap by focusing on examining these two strands of literature to unravel evidence-based policy advisory for Sub-Saharan Africa countries.====A number of policy issues can be inferred considering the current socio-economic statistics in the region. For instance, about 634 million people representing approximately 53% of the population have no access to energy in the region, average per capita GDP is around $1,596 with biomass accounting for more than 80% of the population’s access to energy, and around 40% of the population are in poverty (representing roughly 66% of global extreme poor population) amidst fragile growth trajectories (UNEP, 2017). Unfortunately, the region has diverse sources of unutilised abundance of renewable energy such as solar (10==== ====TW), hydro (350==== ====GW), wind (110==== ====GW) and geothermal (15==== ====GW). The current investment per annum to the energy sector is around $8 billion whereas the region needs roughly $43 billion investment annually from now till 2030–2040 (UNEP, 2017).====Consequently, the study focusses on drawing policy intuition from a more specific dimension by disaggregating Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) into oil-rich and oil-poor countries. This is because energy generation and consumption patterns differ between the oil-rich and oil-poor SSA countries (Adedoyin et al., 2020). Also, growth trajectories and the production complexities differ in these two categories in informing policy advisory. The rest of the study is as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature; sections 3 and 4 focus on the methodology and empirical analysis respectively while section 5 concludes the paper with policy directions.","Pollutant emissions, energy use and real output in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821001022,2 December 2021,2021,Research Article,89.0

In recent years, cultural policy has emerged as an important agenda for policy makers in China.==== Cultural policy covers industries producing services such as motion pictures (movies hereafter), visual arts, music, and theatre. Since the opening up and reform of the economy, which started in 1978 (Coase & Wang, 2012), the Chinese government has played a central role in managing the marketing process of domestically produced movies. Movies are considered as crucial means for political propaganda and public education in China (Zhang, 2004) as well as competitive cultural goods in globalized markets (Berry, 2003). The problem facing China’s movie industry is not very different from other sectors. While, the movie industry is benefitting from partial liberalization, its faces strict cultural and politically motivated regulation. Given the regulation, the movie industry finds it hard to achieve the goal of financial success. In this paper, we investigate the box-office performance of Chinese movie industry. Given the large size of China’s movie market, effective policy-making can improve the standing of China’s movie industry domestically as well as in the global economy (Zhu & Nakajima, 2010).====Movies are generally regarded as experience goods with observable and unobservable heterogeneous attributes. For consumers, the quality and contents of a movie are completely known only after watching it. However, before paying to watch a movie, consumers tend to gather some information about the movie quality and contents. This information is used to determine whether the movie is worth watching. Holbrook and Addis (2008) identify two aspects of the movie quality: (i) the artistic excellence (e.g., critical reviews and industry recognition) and (ii) the commercial success (e.g., market buzz and box office revenues). Information gathered by the consumers on these two quality aspects is used to select the favorite movie, which leads to maximization of the utility from movie watching.====Existing literature such as Elberse and Eliashberg (2003), Elliot and Simmons (2008), Elliott et al. (2017), Holbrook and Addis (2008) and Jung and Kim (2010) examine the impact of the star power, internet media evaluation, internet media buzz, movie awards and budget on commercial success. These studies report mixed results on the relationship between artistic excellence and commercial success. For example, Holbrook (2005) and Holbrook and Addis (2007, 2008) argue that only less than 10% of the variance in popularity or financial performance of movies can be explained by artistic excellence. Peng et al. (2019) also find that these two aspects of the movie quality are not always consistent with each other and sometimes may even be incompatible. In other words, the artistic excellence and commercial success of a movie may provide conflicting information about its quality, which can make the movie watching decision even more difficult. Thus, Cameron (1995), Holbrook and Addis (2008) and Peng et al. (2019) argue that more research is needs to evaluate the influence of artistic excellence on box office revenues to determine whether motion-picture production is a commercial activity or artistic creation.====On the other hand, existing studies suggest that box office performance is also determined by the movie contents. Obviously, consumers can use the movie content ratings to select the movies which they prefer. Moon et al. (2010) and Peress and Spirling (2010) argue that advertising and word of mouth can enhance the effect of movie content ratings on box office revenues. Consumers can identify the movie contents before watching the movie from movie trailers and synopses. Leone and Barowski (2011) report a significant increase in all types of violence (moderate, extreme, rough, and rough and persistent) in top-earning PG-13 rated movies in 1988, 1997, and 2006. Barranco et al. (2017, 2020) argue that, in PG-13 movies, the violent content leads to increased ticket sales. Crane (2014) report that the levels of violence, action, sex and fantasy have steadily increased in Hollywood movies, and producers in other countries have been trying to imitate the same trend on a smaller scale. Garcia-del-Barrio and Zaro (2017) claim that offensive content (such as sex and nudity, violence and gore or profanity) might meet the expectations of many movie watchers. Hence, producers and distributors of movies like to include certain types of content in movies to increase the return on their investment and avoid financial losses.====However, Ravid (1999), De Vany and Walls (2002) and Ravid and Basuroy (2004), among others, argue that movie ratings matter for box-office revenues as viewing is restricted based on the ratings to younger viewers. For example, G and PG rated movies are regarded as more “family friendly” and “family-oriented” and can earn higher average profits than R-rated movies. Peng et al. (2019) provide empirical evidence against the role of genres of love, comedy, action, and other non-mainstream movies in commercial success in China. They show that family-friendly and family-orientated movies, such as animations, are more welcome in the Chinese market. Thus, the mixed nature of existing studies warrants further research to investigate the motivation for the choice of offensive content included in movies.====This paper contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, most existing studies that deal with the effect of movie quality and contents on box office revenues focus on developed countries, e.g., Garcia-del-Barrio and Zaro (2017), Bagella and Becchetti (1999) and Collins et al. (2002) consider the case of the U.S., Italy, and the UK, respectively. We focus on China’s motion-picture industry, which has experienced significant growth over the past two decades. Due to rapid increase in domestic demand and market-orientated institutional reform under its transitional institutions, the motion-picture industry in China is attracting large sums of investment. China’s motion-picture industry is now second largest in the world behind the US (Lang, 2017). The relationship among the movie quality, movie contents and commercial success in China has become even more vague and requires further research, because movie industry-related institutions engrossed in cultural politics struggled to adapt to the market-based economy (Keane 2001; Nakajima 2009; Zhu and Nakajima 2010; Nakajima 2016). By investigating the relationship among the movie quality, movie contents and commercial success of the movies in China, we aim to shed new light on the black box of Chinese institutional reforms affecting the motion picture industry.====Second, the star power, internet media evaluation, internet media buzz and industry recognition are recognized by the motion-picture industry as the most important quality indicators of a movie (De Vany & Walls, 1999; Holbrook & Addis, 2008; Peng et al., 2019). Chinese motion picture industry is subject to strict censorship and regulation, which also deals with category-specific offensive contents. Cultural policies such as the 2006 ==== and the 2017 ==== require strict censorship and regulation of the “core socialist values” of domestic made movies. A movie can fail the censorship process if (a) it includes content which is not in line with the mainstream ideology, morality, and social harmony and/or the movie quality fails to conform to the specified standard (Elliott et al., 2017). The analysis presented in this paper explores the impact of movie quality and contents on box-office revenue by incorporating the cultural polices such as the censorship and regulation.====Finally, to deal with possible non-linearity problem in empirical analysis, Vany and Walls (1999) and Collins et al. (2002) introduced the idea of threshold revenue and applied an ordered logit model to forecast the box office revenue of movies. In this paper, we apply a double-threshold model to estimate the effect of movie quality and contents on box-office revenues. The estimated effect of the movie quality and content may vary significantly across ranges of a continuous measure of movie star power, which can also be viewed as a proxy for the movie budget (De Vany & Walls, 1999; Litman & Ahn, 1998; Ravid, 1999). Thus, we are able to differentiate the varying effects of the movie quality and contents on low and medium star power concentrated movies from high star power concentrated movies. In other words, we are able to differentiate between the small/medium-budget and large-budget movies. To the best of our knowledge, none of the available studies has applied the threshold model for an in-depth empirical analysis of the relationship between the movie quality, movie contents and box-office revenues in China.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. A brief review of related studies is provided in Section 2. The methodology used and data are discussed in Section 3. Empirical results are presented and discussed in Section 4.

Therefore, our goal is to investigate whether the determinants of bank profitability fit these uniform solutions. Accordingly, we explore the profitability of European banks in various settings from 2012 to 2016, which is the period marked by tough reforms. Since a decrease in profit may be treated as a sign of financial difficulties, we model static (i.e., loss) and dynamized (i.e., loss, moderate and severe decreases in profits) indicators of bank situations based on a sample of approximately 6700 bank-year observations. Different patterns of the determinants of profit decreases are found among different types and sizes of banks. Moreover, the determinants of loss events apparently differ from those accounting for profit decreases. These findings underline that a “one-size-fits-all” approach to regulation and supervision is not adequate for market realities.","The global financial crisis (GFC) significantly changed the environment in which banks operate not only because of the changes in regulations but also because of the ultra-low interest rates in many European countries, the bank-sovereign nexus==== and a strong focus on the further harmonization of the banking sector in the EU (so-called banking union). More restrictive regulations have been adopted, especially in the case of bank capital adequacy (with a greater focus on Tier 1 capital and the introduction of capital buffers), leverage and liquidity. Additionally, the space of freedom given to national regulators to adjust solutions to national conditions has been significantly reduced. Regulations are treated as preventive tools that may help avoid severe financial problems of banks in the future. European banks remained resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, which shows that post-GFC reforms allowed the EU to successfully pass a real-time stress test because of capital buffers (see, e.g., Aiyar et al. 2021).====In addition to a set of preventive tools, remedial tools, i.e., the tools used when financial difficulties emerge, have been introduced. These are especially ==== recovery plans and resolution regimes. Recovery plans provide guidelines regarding how to restructure a bank that faces financial troubles. In this plan, triggers to initialize a recovery plan are presented. Triggers are a set of financial ratios with certain thresholds; for example, a return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) or total capital ratio (TCR) below a certain level may initiate the recovery plan. The level of profit directly impacts, among other factors, profitability and capital adequacy, which is one of the crucial determinants of bank safety. Resolution regimes are used when a bank that faces financial troubles cannot be recapitalized by investors, and there is no hope to improve the bank’s financial position. This tool is contrary to a bailout, which was heavily used during the GFC and previous crises. Under the resolution framework, the most important and controversial feature is a bail-in, i.e., covering losses with the use of bank capital and eligible liabilities (i.e., other than deposits protected by deposit guarantee schemes). All of these tools are used in a rather uniform way across Europe, while European banks represent different characteristics. Therefore, it is of high importance to ask whether this uniform approach is the correct way to regulate and supervise banks in Europe.====A loss or a significant decrease in bank profit is a sign of financial troubles and may lead to the use of remedial tools. The scale of financial problems typically depends not only on the risk appetite represented by a given bank in previous years but also adverse macroeconomic conditions. From both the regulatory and managerial perspectives, it is highly important to detect potential problems at an early stage. Therefore, we search for the determinants of decreases in profits, including loss events. This is expected to shed new light on the “one-size-fits-all” approach to bank regulation and supervision (e.g., through the selection of triggers and their thresholds).====Because various types of banks operate on the European market, we differentiate between commercial, cooperative, savings and other banks (e.g., investment and private banks). The strong position of banks outside the commercial sector is specific in certain countries, such as in Austria, Germany, Italy and France (cooperative and savings banks), Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland (cooperative banks), and Norway, Portugal and Sweden (savings banks). Commercial banks focus to the greatest extent on profit-seeking and increasing value for their shareholders. These banks were forced by regulators to deleverage to a large extent, and a side effect of this process was a lower ROE. In an environment of ultra-low interest rates, banks strive to increase non-interest income, which does not absorb capital or increase leverage. The market position of commercial banks has typically been strong in each country. Cooperative and savings banks are more based on relationships with the local communities, which is derived from their origin, and even currently, these banks are less profit-oriented than their commercial peers. Savings and cooperative banks also engage in less sophisticated transactions than commercial banks, except for the largest players of each type.====Against this background, the goal of this paper is to identify the determinants of the decreases in profits (from moderate to severe) and loss events among different groups of European banks according to their type and size by giving attention to balance sheet structures (e.g., the amount of guaranteed deposits, equity capital and risk-free assets) and sources of profits (interest and non-interest margins). The identification of differences is important for policymakers to intervene and bank managers to perform remedy actions at an early stage and to reduce the potential costs of bank restructuring. Moreover, this approach allows us to verify whether a “one-size-fits-all” regulatory and supervisory approach is adequate for market realities.====The broader perspective used here is very important because actual bank bankruptcies and other distress events are not numerous; thus, focusing only on these events is too narrow. Other studies have included cases of bailouts and forced mergers as distress categories (e.g., Arena 2008; Betz et al. 2014; Altman et al. 2015) and events of a bank’s negative equity without any bailout or state aid (Iwanicz-Drozdowska et al. 2018a). This study appears to be the first to analyse the determinants of loss and profit deterioration events. On the one hand, this approach could help bank managers identify potential threats and react immediately to maximize the likelihood of recovery. On the other hand, the identification of the determinants of loss events and decreases in profits could support supervisory authorities in developing a new set of analytical tools that might help detect banks’ potential problems at an early stage to minimize the costs of restructuring.====Compared with previous studies (e.g., Betz et al. 2014; Altman et al. 2015; Berger et al. 2016, Ozdemir et al. 2019), this analysis extends beyond the peak of the GFC and does not cover the bank problems that occurred during this time. Significant changes in the regulatory framework and the situation of financial markets with ultra-low interest rates constitute new operating conditions for banks, and their financial difficulties might arise from different sources than the GFC.====This paper is organized as follows.

A pigouvian tax on CO==== emissions is often presented as the simplest and most efficient policy to reduce CO==== emissions (see the synthesis from Gillingham and Stock, 2018), although, from a welfare point of view, it could be complemented by other policies as for instance regulation and norm setting (see Stiglitz, 2019).====Yet, the economic literature reveals a lack of consensus among economists and policy-makers concerning the impacts of climate change and the appropriate policies to face this risk. Appropriate macroeconomic modelling frameworks have emerged to quantify the economic impacts of climate change, breaking down the different mechanisms at play from fossil energy use to final damage. Amongst them, the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, the Input-Output models, Agent-based models and the Macroeconometric models (for a recent overview of these models see the NGFS Technical Supplement, 2019 and Bolton et al., 2020).====The IAMs describe not only relationships between human activities and environmental processes but also between socio-economic systems and environmental systems. The most renowned IAM is Nordhaus' Dynamic Integrated Climate and Economy (DICE) model (1991, 1994, 2007, 2013, 2018). It consists of a macroeconomic module, modelling the relationship between economic activity, GHG emissions and the costs of their reduction (through an abatement curve) and a climate module, which links the rise in concentration of GHG emissions to the increase in world temperatures (that is, the climate sensitivity). Nordhaus and Yang (1996) and Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) developed the RICE, a regional version of the DICE model with different inputs endowments (in labour, capital and energy) by geographic areas. Other examples of IAMs are the models DART (Deke et al., 2001) with a general equilibrium framework and the inclusion of agricultural productivity and sea level rise, WITCH (Bosetti et al., 2006) that considers non-cooperative behaviour between different regions, MERGE (Manne et al., 1995), PAGE (Alberth & Hope, 2006) and FUND (Tol, 2005; Waldhoff et al., 2014).====On the contrary, CGE models are dynamic general equilibrium models that describe the economy as a system of monetary flows across sectors and agents, solving numerically combination of supply and demand quantities, as well as relative prices to clear the commodity and labour market simultaneously (NGFS technical Supplement, 2019). The OECD ENV-Linkages multi country by Chateau et al. (2014) is one example of a recursive dynamic neo-classical CGE model.====Our contribution proposes a fully transparent and free-access model, the Advanced Climate Change Long-term model (ACCL), with a rich and endogenous modelling of the GDP growth dynamics. This tool is based on a supply-side approach. A major blind spot of the economic literature on climate change is Total factor productivity, which is the most significant determinant of the future path of GDP, but which is sketchily presented, usually as a deterministic trend. We present here a comprehensive modelisation of TFP, including all its major drivers. Moreover, capital intensity is endogenous. Our contribution could be classified in the Macroeconometric models family. It is a user-friendly projection tool====, designed with R-Shiny, which allows the user to run scenario-analysis to identify and quantify the consequences of energy price shocks on GDP. The user can change at will all the hypotheses and parameters.====In this model, we assess the long-run effects of carbon taxation on economic growth through two opposite channels. First, the negative consequences of carbon tax, or any other regulation increasing prices of CO====-emitting energies, on GDP growth via the impact of higher energy prices on Total Factor productivity (TFP). Then, the positive economic impact of limiting climate change consequences, through the abatement of carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions (as the increase in the prices of CO====-emitting energies has a deterrent effect on their consumption).====To address this question, we build an original and extensive database that enables us to estimate or calibrate most of the relationships of the model (18 developed countries and seven emerging countries among the world greatest polluters, plus six regions to cover the rest of the world). We then use these empirical findings to implement-global and local projections for the whole world, decomposed in 31 countries and regions at the 2060 and 2100 horizons, allowing for user-designed scenarios of both climate change and carbon taxation.====Our results illustrate the “tragedy of the horizon” with net GDP losses induced by climate policies in the medium term, but a favourable net impact in the long term. Similarly, we can presume that international coordination is of significant importance since climate change is a global issue. A collective reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions would actually benefit a vast majority of countries. Yet, these social benefits can be neglected by national governments facing high individual costs to implement such a policy and fearing inaction by other emitters. Our simulations do show that for each country, the best individual strategy is a “Business As Usual” (BAU) one and stringent climate policies for others. Hence, the global best collective strategy would be the implementation of stringent climate policies simultaneously in all countries. This coordination problem comes from the fact that a climate policy has a detrimental impact on GDP through TFP decrease in the country which implements it, but a favourable GDP impact through lower environmental damage for all countries.====The rest of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the general framework of the ACCL tool. Section 3 presents the evaluation of the GDP before climate damage. Section 4 presents the endogenous evaluation of the global warming and of GDP damage from climate change. Section 5 proposes several climate scenarios, corresponding to business as usual country behavior or to the implementation of climate policies.

The negative impact of infectious diseases on remittances suggest that while there are downside risks in the wake of current pandemic, the scenario does not seem to be that bleak as the remittances to India are countercyclical with respect to economic growth in the home country and largely decoupled from host country ==== fundamentals. As the remittances act as shock absorbers during the time of low economic growth in the home country, India must further build up a conducive eco system to nurture these valuable foreign exchange in a well directed manner.","The economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be grimmer when observed from the migration perspective. As the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis unfolds, the volume of remittances is projected to decline 14 per cent by 2021 compared to the pre COVID-19 levels in 2019 (Ratha et al., 2020). This effect is going to be deleterious for countries, particularly in South Asia, where remittances act as the lifeline for a large chunk of poor population. India- the largest economy of the region has emerged as the largest recipient of international remittances over the years. Remittances play a vital role in economic development of India through promoting output growth, household spending on health and education, poverty alleviation, financial inclusion and entrepreneurship. The setback to the remittance inflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may therefore offset the progress made on several development indicators during the past few decades. Given the importance of remittances for the Indian economy, it is crucial to understand how the pandemic would influence the flow of remittances in the country. Towards this end, the study employs a gravity model approach to the determinants of remittances with special attention to the impact of infectious diseases in the host countries. Epidemics have always been a part of life and the COVID-19 pandemic is not the first infectious disease with profound economic effects across the world (Cevik, 2020). This offers an opportunity to look at the past experience of India by utilizing the data on the infectious diseases in the host economy.====The present study constructs a database of bilateral remittances from 99 source countries for the period 2000–2018 and combines it with the data on prevalence of infectious diseases (namely, MERS Cov, SARS, Ebola, Meningitis and Nipah Virus) in the host countries to assess the latter’s impact on the inflows of remittances to India.====A systematic analysis of the direct impact of infectious diseases and other macroeconomic determinants of remittances would provide useful insights to the policymakers about the potential disruptions in the remittances in wake of the current pandemic.====The empirical findings of the study suggest that remittances inflows to India respond to the key gravity variables and the outbreak of infectious diseases in the host economy. The study finds robust evidence of an adverse effect of infectious diseases in the host country on the remittances inflows into India. Consistent with the previous studies, both altruistic and self interest motives drive remittances to India. However, the altruism seems to be a relatively dominant factor. The remittances are countercyclical with respect to economic growth in India which suggests that Indian workers tend to remit more during the time of economic hardships at home. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, macroeconomic factors at the host country do not exert any significant effect on the remittance inflows. To sum up, the negative impact of infectious diseases on remittances suggest that while there are downside risks in wake of the current pandemic, the scenario does not seem to be that bleak as the remittances to India are triggered by altruism and largely decoupled from host country macroeconomic fundamentals.====To the best of the author’s knowledge, the study is the first attempt to identify the impact of infectious diseases on flow of remittances. Also, it offers the first application of gravity model in identifying the determinants of workers’ remittances in context of India. The extant empirical literature on the determinants of migrant’s remittances to India has mainly focused either on the microeconomic determinants by employing household survey data, or aggregate remittance flows (see e.g., Gupta, 2006; Gupta, 2010; Navita & Pal, 2020). The present study utilizes a recent approach in remittances literature that combines the microeconomic antecedents on the motives to remit with the macroeconomic data to explore the drivers of remittances.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section “Related literature and empirical framework” discusses the related empirical literature and framework of the study. Section “Data and methods” describes the data and the methods. Section “Empirical analysis and discussion” presents the empirical results of the gravity model and outlines the implications for remittances flow in wake of the current pandemic.

Following the announcement of the framework, there has been some slowdown in balance sheet expansion for O-SIIs relative to other banks. O-SII banks have altered their balance sheet structure, consistent with the incentive given by the O-SII buffer to reduce complexity and interconnectedness. This has been accompanied by somewhat weaker pricing power of O-SII banks, which along with higher capital requirements seem not to have led to higher risk-taking by O-SII banks. No discernible change in risk-taking strategies along with the reduction in the funding cost advantage may have contributed to a decline in profitability of O-SIIs. Overall, the introduction of the structural, non-cyclical higher capital buffers for the key nodes of the euro area ","Bold reforms to limit risks associated with systemically important financial institutions have been implemented following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The Basel Committee, at the request of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), proposed measures to address the systemic and moral hazard risks associated with systemically important banks, and published its frameworks for Global Systemically-Important Banks (G-SIB) and Domestic Systemically-Important Banks (D-SIB) in 2011 and 2012, respectively (BCBS, 2011, 2012). The EU implemented the D-SIB framework by introducing specific rules for “other systemically important institutions” (O-SIIs) in 2013. The additional capital buffers for O-SII banks were announced in most EU member states in 2015, with the phase-in of the additional requirements left to the discretion of the national authorities.==== The designation of a bank as an O-SII depends on its size, importance in lending, collecting deposits, and processing payments, complexity, cross-border activity, and interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system (EBA, 2014).====While the effectiveness of these reforms has to a certain extent been examined for G-SIBs, there is only scarce evidence for other systemically important banks. Very few studies have explicitly examined the impact of post-crisis reforms on systemically important banks across such dimensions as balance sheet size and structure, funding, pricing power, risk-taking, and profitability, with the exception of work done for G-SIBs (FSB, 2020). According to our knowledge, there is hardly any study examining in a comprehensive manner the impact of these reforms on D-SIBs or O-SIIs. Given that these banks are important for their domestic economies (ESRB, 2017), this study intends to fill in this gap by examining the impact of the O-SII framework on euro area banks.

In contrast, ==== and foreign aid were found to increase poverty rate in SSA. These results are robust to the Lewbel two-stage least squares estimator. The practical implications of these findings for post-COVID-19 macroeconomic policies in SSA are discussed.","The agenda 2030 makes it a priority for countries to reduce extreme poverty and reduce at least half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.==== The UN (2020) report on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicates that extreme global poverty declined from 15.7% in 2010 to 10% in 2015. It was estimated that extreme global poverty in 2019 was 8.2% and 8.8% in 2020. The 2020 extreme poverty rate was the first rise in global poverty since 1998 and close to the 2017 level. Thus, with the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 71 million additional people will be living in extreme poverty. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is projected that extreme poverty in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) would be increasing astronomically, with an additional 32 million and 26 million people, respectively, living below the international poverty line (UN, 2020).====Also, the pandemic has exacerbated working poverty across the globe due to workplace closure which negatively affected 81% of employers and 66% of own-account workers in 2020 (UN, 2020). The gender poverty gap has also been widening, and young workers are exposed to poverty more systematically than adults due to inadequate earnings and job deficits. In 2019, 12.8% of workers between the ages of 15 and 24 lived in poverty, compared with 6.3% of workers over 24 (UN, 2020). The working-age poverty gap is expected to worsen by the pandemic. These indicate that the target of ending poverty in 2030 is likely to be missed. Therefore, eradicating poverty requires an understanding of the factors that influence it. Traditionally, policymakers have attempted to alleviate poverty in developing countries through economic growth. However, it is argued that eradicating poverty in developing countries, especially in SSA, requires not just economic growth (Anderson, d'Orey, Duvendack, & Esposito, 2018). Thus, poverty reduction requires other economic factors that cause a structural change in the economy and the significant factors that can cause structural change are remittances and financial sector development. Therefore, it is vital to explore the role of remittances and financial development on poverty eradication in developing countries, especially SSA countries.====Theoretically, the impact of remittances on poverty reduction is ambiguous. For instance, it is argued that remittances can contribute to poverty reduction by improving human capital, economic growth, credit constraint, household disposable income, savings, investment and household’s expenditure on health and education in remittance-receiving countries (Azizi, 2018, 2021; Konte, 2018; Masron & Subramaniam, 2018; Terrelonge, 2014). Contrarily, remittances could worsen poverty if it is skewed, favouring more affluent households’ income (Azizi, 2021). Thus, when remittances contribute to income inequality in remittance-receiving countries, it can spur poverty. Anyanwu (2011) unveiled that international remittance increases income inequality such that a 10% increase in remittance flows is associated with a 0.013% increase in income inequality in Africa. It is also claimed that remittances are not always used for investment purposes; however, most remittances are used for consumption purposes (Acheampong, Erdiaw-Kwasie, & Abunyewah, 2021; Ssozi & Asongu, 2016). This suggests that when remittances are used to finance consumption rather than investment, it can worsen human development and poverty in remittance-receiving countries. In addition, Azam and Gubert (2006) argue that remittances flow can spur poverty for two major reasons. First, the authors argue that migration is a collective decision made by extended family, which involves the strategic sending of offspring away to diversify its risk and build a social network. Because of this, remittances to SSA are to support family consumption in case of adverse shocks rather than investment. Second, the authors contend that remittances involve some moral hazard, as those remaining behind tend to exert less effort to take care of themselves, knowing that migrants will compensate for any consumption shortfalls. Such moral hazard makes those left behind lazy and earns less income.====From the trickle-down theory, it is argued that financial development could contribute to poverty reduction by facilitating economic growth. Thus, as a well-developed financial system contributes to economic growth, the benefits of the economic growth generated—such as job creation, increasing households’ income, reducing income inequality, and provision of tax revenues for funding pro-poor projects—contribute significantly to poverty reduction (Abosedra, Shahbaz, & Nawaz, 2016; Zhuang et al., 2009). Also, financial development can improve poverty since it enables poorer households to have access to credit, which can increase the assets owned by the poor (Abosedra et al., 2016; Jalilian & Kirkpatrick, 2002). On the other hand, financial development can increase poverty, especially in developing countries, when borrowing costs are high, and income inequality increases. For instance, Jauch and Watzka (2016) and Tiwari, Shahbaz, and Islam (2013) indicated that financial development contributes significantly to income inequality.====It is challenging for policymakers to formulate sound policies towards poverty eradication in the face of the conflicting theoretical argument on the effect of remittances and financial development on poverty reduction. Therefore, to inform policies geared towards poverty alleviation, it is essential to empirically evaluate the poverty reduction effect of remittances and financial development in SSA. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of remittances and financial development on poverty reduction using a panel of 44 SSA countries from 2010 to 2019. We focused on SSA since the poverty rate in the regions has been increasing. For instance, about 40% of the SSA population are living below the US% 1.90 a day poverty line in 2018, accounting for two-thirds of the global extreme poor population.==== Also, the available data suggests that international remittances flow to SSA has been below any other region (see Ratha et al., 2020). In addition, remittances to SSA declined by 0.5% between 2018 and 2019 to remain close to $48 billion, and with the COVID-19 pandemic causing many SSA migrants to lose their jobs, remittances were estimated to decline by 23.1% in 2020 to reach $37 billion (Ratha et al., 2020). Also, SSA has a weak financial system compared to other regions, although there have been some improvements recently (Mlachila, Jidoud, Newiak, Radzewicz-Bak, & Takebe, 2016). With these justifications, this study focusing on SSA will add significantly to knowledge and inform post-COVID-19 macroeconomic policies that seek to address poverty in the region.====This study makes three (3) principal contributions to the literature in the following direction. First, this study uses a novel panel data approach to provide new empirical evidence on the impact of remittances and financial development on poverty reduction in SSA. Second, this study examines the effects of remittances and financial development on different working-age population cohorts' poverty in SSA. Third, this paper also extends the literature by exploring the gendered poverty effect of remittances and financial development in SSA. Our empirical results indicate that while remittances increase poverty, financial development contributes significantly to poverty reduction. The results consistently reveal that remittances increase both male and female poverty rates, while financial development significantly reduces male and female poverty rates. Other factors such as economic growth, foreign direct investment, and trade openness contributed significantly to reducing poverty. In contrast, government expenditure and foreign aid increased poverty rate in SSA. These results are robust to an alternative econometric estimator. These results have important implications for informing post-COVID-19 policies for achieving poverty eradication in SSA.====The remainder of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 presents a brief literature review. Section 3 presents data and methodology, while Section 4 reports and discusses the empirical results.

Thus, to help fill this gap, this paper identifies the factors that contribute to improving equality of opportunity and the policies that should be implemented to achieve it. This work is novel in various ways. First, it defines student resilience in a new way using multilevel models applied to two groups of countries. Second, it analyses the determinants of equality of opportunity in the ","Social mobility has been broadly studied from different points of view and disciplines, especially from an education economics perspective. This interest arises because of how vital it is for advanced societies to guarantee equality of opportunity given the high economic and social consequences at stake. There is clear consensus on the importance of education as a social elevator and the need for devising economic policies that increase equality of opportunity in the education of individuals. However, despite this consensus, there is relatively little research that analyses equality of opportunity or provides economic policy recommendations for fostering it. Thus, there is a gap in the literature that our study aims to help fill. In contrast to other studies, our paper does not simply analyse equality of opportunity. It proposes policies, mainly economic ones, that aim to improve equality of opportunity, using, for the first time in this field of study, the concept of resilience defined via multilevel analysis econometric techniques that take into account the varying effect of the socio-economic background of countries.====Education, as the prime mover of the “social elevator”, is key (OECD, 2018a; Ermisch & Francesconi, 2001), especially for upward social mobility (OECD, 2018a), i.e. the rising of individuals to higher social standings than their parents. The premise underlying these studies is that education helps mitigate the negative effects of a student's socio-economic background. It serves as an inclusive tool that fosters personal and academic development, especially across generations (relative social mobility), and helps lessen the differences in the futures of the most disadvantaged students as better academic performance brings with it a higher probability of future success (Hout, 2012; Allmendinger & Leibfried, 2003; Pastor & Peraita, 2010).====In addition to being vital ethically, equal opportunity has major socio-economic impacts. It is one of the goals adopted by the United Nations in its Sustainable Development Goals programme, a principle of advanced societies (Akiba, LeTendre & Scribner, 2007) and a central pillar of the United Nations Human Development Report. A society in which the socio-economic background of parents determines that of their children implies not only inequality of opportunity but also inequality of income and occupation. All of which leads to a lack of personal satisfaction for anyone coming from a disadvantaged background (OECD, 2018a). It is also detrimental to meritocracy. Furthermore, the lack of opportunities means human capital is underutilised (OECD, 2018a; Handl, 1985), with both business opportunities and personal talent being lost. This leads to lower potential economic growth (OECD, 2016; OECD, 2018a). Likewise, the most educated societies become more tolerant (Bynner et al., 2002; Borgonovi & Miyamoto 2010) and open to change and have higher levels of confidence, a greater awareness of equity and less serious problems arising from insecurity (Feinstein, Budge, Vorhaus & Duckworth, 2008; Lochner & Moretti, 2004). Democracy is also stronger in such societies, in which democratic participation is fostered (OECD, 2018a; Pastor Monsálvez, Peraita de Grado, Soler Guillén & Zaera, 2012).====Our study seeks to analyse equality of opportunity in education, detect its determinants and, based on these, propose economic policies for improving it in market economy countries with relatively strong public welfare systems, such as OECD countries. With these objectives in mind, we use the concept of ==== applied to education. A student is considered resilient if, despite their relatively disadvantaged socio-economic background, they overcome adversity to achieve a relatively high level of academic performance. We consider an education system more equitable—i.e. that it guarantees a greater degree of equality of opportunity—the greater the proportion of resilient students it has, in accordance with the OECD (2018b). With the aim of increasing the proportion of resilient students, this study explores the determinants of resilience and outlines primarily economic policies.====Resilience in education is not a new concept and has been used in previous studies (Borman & Overman, 2004; OECD, 2011; OECD, 2018b; Agasisti & Longobardi, 2014; Agasisti & Longobardi, 2017; Agasisti, Longobardi & Regoli, 2017; Wills & Hofmeyr, 2019). In contrast, one aspect that differentiates our study is the use of a multilevel econometric technique to redefine resilience. This technique allows capturing the effect of socio-economic background and how it varies from country to country. It also means we can control for correlations between students in the same country.====Regarding the determinants of resilience and economic policies, there is no doubt that public expenditure is a key tool for states to improve the services provided to the public, including education. The literature has studied in depth the effect that the amount of public expenditure has on the academic performance of students, while the effect expenditure has on equality of opportunity has received less attention (although the measures in each case are not necessarily mutually exclusive====). Likewise, a question arises about economic policies and their effect on equality of opportunity: should OECD countries implement the same expenditure policies regardless of wealth?====Public expenditure can be allocated in many ways, and variations in effectiveness must be analysed. The works that analyse the effects of expenditure on academic performance find that some policies are only relevant in more developed countries (OECD, 2013). Thus, it is important to investigate and verify if proposed policies are valid for all countries regardless of standard of living or if different policies are required according to a country's level of development. This paper analyses these questions to provide economic policy measures that take into account standard of living aimed at boosting equality of opportunity for individuals in OECD countries.====With this objective in mind, we use multilevel probit models that consider the characteristics of students, including soft skills, and their schools, controlling for the differences found in the OECD with resilience as the dependent variable. To obtain results adjusted for the standard of living of countries, the OECD countries are broken into two groups according to income per capita. Using these results, we perform simulations to model potential gains in equality of opportunity in countries if the proposed recommendations were followed and to identify the limits of such gains.====By using multilevel models, we are also able to study the differences between individuals and schools controlling for different levels of development and the varying criteria followed by the expenditure policies of different countries. Thus, our study also examines possible heterogeneities between the two groups of countries at more microeconomic levels (individuals and schools), where soft skills may be of special importance for resilience (Sandoval-Hernández & Białowolski, 2016; García-Crespo, Fernández-Alonso & Muñiz, 2021).====Our study uses the PISA database because, in addition to data on comparable academic performance, it contains information that allows controlling for numerous individual and school characteristics. The database provides highly standardised data, with information on the socio-economic background of families in each wave. Thanks to the long-term nature of PISA, the data can be used to determine the proportion or percentage of resilient students by country and year for an extensive time period (2003–2018).====This paper is structured as follows. Following this introduction, Section 2 reviews the literature, Section 3 explains the methodology, Section 4 describes the results and Section 5 outlines economic policy recommendations that can be derived from the results.

This study aims to analyses case studies through the SEIR model in three Southeast Asia countries including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The SEIR model incorporates two types measures including social behavior and lockdowns as well as hospital preparedness. The SEIR model reveals that Malaysia, despite its relatively low testing capacity but with the application of the national lockdown, can slash the coronavirus transmission while Indonesia has still struggled to contain the COVID-19 flow owing to partial lockdowns. Singapore, at one hand, can successfully contain the coronavirus due to the national lockdowns, and the better healthcare system. With this point in mind, it is not surprising that Singapore has very low fatality rates and significantly low cases after lockdowns. Better preparedness lockdowns, and sufficient testing capacity are keys to controlling the COVID-19 flow, especially if the development of vaccines or distribution of respective vaccines is under progress.","In the past, our humankind experienced many pandemics such as Spanish flu and HIV/AIDS that led to unexpected fatalities (====). Despite our humankind experiences in the past, the COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented impact as it has severely affected almost all continents across the world, leading to multiple affected sectors such as social, economy, and health (====; ====).====It is not surprising that developed countries such as Germany, Italy, and Spain have faced difficulties in managing the COVID-19 flow (====). While developed countries are relatively easier in handling the COVID-19 due to their high-testing capacity and better healthcare management, developing countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, have struggled in providing an appropriate testing capacity and accurate data (====).====The government of Indonesia has never applied lockdowns during the COVID-19 transmission (====). The Indonesian government argues that the best approach during the COVID-19 flow is to balance between economic and the pandemic control. In doing so, the government has never imposed national lockdowns since the first confirmed cases on March 2nd, 2020 (====). After the government announced that two female Indonesians were positively infected by the coronavirus, the government has proposed the partial lockdowns or the large social restriction, so-called “====” (PSBB), to hamper the COVID-19 transmission (====). The government of Indonesia has also permitted the governors to apply PSBB in their own authorities if needed.====Malaysia, compared to its closest neighbor, Indonesia, has more successfully slashed the COVID-19 flow (====; ====). Malaysia differs from Indonesia in handling the pandemic as the Malaysian government has imposed the national lockdowns while the Indonesia only have applied the partial lockdowns, so-called the large social restriction. The Malaysian first confirmed cases were on January 25th, 2020 after a woman and a kid met their male relative who was positively confirmed in Singapore (====). Later, owing to high infected cases, the government had imposed the first national lockdown since March 18th, 2020 until the end of May 2020 (====).====By contrast, Singapore, an Asian developed country, has successfully slashed the COVID-19 flow and even better, Singapore has a very low Case Fatality Rate (CFR) < 0.1 % (====). Owing to the high quality of the healthcare system, Singapore is more advanced and more successful in handling the COVID-19 flow than its neighbors (====; ====). Due to its success, there are several scholars investigated the COVID-19 flow in Singapore. Existing studies reported some issues such as clinical analysis (====), the impacts of the containment (====, ====), and the length of stay (====, ====)====Since most studies about the COVID-19 have focused on areas beyond Asia, there are limited papers dedicated to Asian case studies. Of existing Asian studies, despite their useful findings, only a few studies have focused on the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered (SEIR) model for Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Several studies have investigated issues such as the impacts of the pandemic on Malaysian tourism (====), clinical analysis (====), mathematical models (====; ====; ====; ====), and the society preparedness (====; ====). For Indonesian cases, there are limited studies (e.g., ====; ====) and only one study (====) discussed the epidemic model. That study (====) also did not analyse the impacts of lockdowns and social behavior in the COVID-19 transmission.====With due respect to the aforementioned studies, those studies did not separate the impacts of lockdown and social behavior. Moreover, there are very limited studies providing mechanistic models to reproduce the COVID-19 in Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia. Those studies (e.g., ====; ====), for instance, discussed epidemic models based on statistical fitting which is not useful as statistical fitting models aim to fit models with observed data, lacking capability to conduct policy analysis (====). To the best author’s knowledge, there is no available study that develops a mechanistic SEIR model for each country. Hence, developing a mechanistic SEIR model for each country is important as another study (====) pointed out that mechanistic SEIR models can give users more spaces to explore possible policies.====Moreover, as disseminating information about the COVID-19 flow and its analysis is important, this study aims to develop a SEIR model for three Southeast countries including Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia respectively.

One of the important policy objectives of the Scheme is to curb rural out-migration by guaranteeing demand-driven employment opportunities for 100 days in a year in rural areas. This paper uses a large sample survey-based nationally representative data set and different probability models to investigate how MGNREGS influences individuals’ seasonal rural out-migration decisions. The results reveal that contrary to the policy objective, ====, ==== and ==== from the Scheme increases an individual’s propensity to out-migrate. However, the Scheme serves broader and equally critical socio-economic goals of empowerment through income security and positive network effects. MGNREGS, on the one hand, significantly drives the decisions of aspirational migration of rural individuals, particularly females and the relatively advantaged. On the other, it curbs distress migration of the relatively disadvantaged by providing them with basic livelihood opportunities within the rural areas. Based on the findings, the paper draws several policy implications and discusses key policy imperatives towards expanding the scale and scope of the public-works Scheme.","Public works-based rural livelihood programmes have long been critical public policy tools to address problems of unemployment, extreme poverty, and inequality in rural India==== . In 2005, the Government of India (GoI) launched the world’s largest public works programme – the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (henceforth, MGNREGS or the Scheme), providing social security net to about 15 percent of the country’s population (Sukhtankar, 2016). Under the nationwide implemented Scheme, the scope of objectives that typically governed the public-works programmes was extended further to include promotion of inclusive growth, empowerment of rural women, and reduction of rural out-migration. The expanded scope reflects the importance that policymakers bestowed on MGNREGS to serve the economy’s broader social and rural development goals and how the Scheme could potentially address other emerging public policy challenges in India.====The objective of reducing rural out-migration, by providing employment guarantee and income security through the rural works-based livelihood Scheme, is particularly noteworthy from a policy perspective. It is motivated by the fact that there has been a significant rise in internal migration in the past two to three decades, particularly employment-related migration in India==== . Various push and pull factors have contributed to this trend. Prevalence of extreme hunger and poverty, lack of employment opportunities, rising rural-urban wage gap, fragmentation of rural landholdings and assets, farm mechanization leading to labour-substituting methods of cultivation, debt trap, environmental shocks etc. have substantially increased risk and uncertainty for rural households (de Haan, 2017; Nayyar & Kim, 2018). Consequently, these have led to individuals and households becoming occupationally diverse and spatially mobile, thus reinforcing the phenomenon of rural out-migration (Keshri & Bhagat, 2012; Shah et al., 2018).====High rural out-migration rates, in turn, posed significant challenges for policymakers. On the one hand, it reduced agricultural productivity due to an outflow of human capital and a relatively skilled rural labour force (Deotti & Estruch, 2016). On the other hand, such mobility resulted in additional demand on limited urban resources, worsening the conditions of both the rural out-migrants and the urban poor – posing substantial policy challenges in managing the pace and nature of urbanization (Tacoli et al., 2015; Imai et al., 2017).====Policymakers sought to address both these challenges through MGNREGS, based on the following rationale. The nationwide public works scheme, enforced through an Act of Parliament (called the MGNREGA, 2005), mandated to provide for “====” (Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, 2005). The basic idea of the Act was to provide locally demanded public works in rural areas and establish workers’ legal rights on stipulated minimum wages (unemployment insurance, otherwise) for a certain minimum number of days, in a direct and time-bound manner (Table 1). Policymakers expected that MGNREGS would create a vibrant rural economy by gainfully engaging rural workers, particularly those with a higher propensity to migrate. At the same time, providing employment guarantees and income security for individuals or households in their familiar local (rural) environment could potentially reduce excess demand on limited urban resources by arresting rural out-migration, particularly those driven by the push factors.====After its nationwide implementation in 2008, available evidence indicates that the impact of MGNREGS on curbing rural out-migration has been mixed. One set of studies suggest that MGNREGS demotivated rural out-migration by increasing the rural out-migrants’ opportunity cost since the programme provided guaranteed employment primarily during the off-season of agriculture (Dodd et al., 2017; Imbert & Papp, 2015; Kundu, 2014; Parida, 2016). Further, some studies documented how rural labourers, particularly women, preferred relatively safer employment options provided by MGNREGS in their place of residence or their vicinity vis-à-vis hazardous jobs in urban areas, helping them avoid undue physical and financial risks (Khera and Nayak, 2009). On the other hand, another set of studies found that rural out-migration either increased in states where the Scheme was poorly implemented (Merfeld, 2019) or have had no significant effect on rural out-migration (Bird & Deshingkar, 2013; Khera, 2011; Sridhar & Reddy, 2015).====On the basic question of whether MGNREGS serves the policy goal of arresting rural out-migration in India, relevant scholarly investigations are limited and suffer from some significant limitations. Studies that show a negative or insignificant impact of MGNREGS on rural out-migration mostly have a narrow geographical scope of analysis, and the results are based on small sample surveys limiting their external validity. For example, the study by Das (2015) is based on only two blocks of one district in a state, while Kundu (2014) examines data from only one block of one district in a state. Studies that do use nationally representative data (Imbert & Papp, 2015) examine the phenomenon over a period when MGNREGS was not yet fully implemented across all the states in India.====It is in the above context that this paper makes a significant contribution to the extant literature. ====, as opposed to studies based on small sample surveys with limited geographical scope, we examine the impact of MGNREGS on seasonal rural out-migration decisions based on an extensive, geographically dispersed, nationally representative sample survey - the Indian Human Development Survey-2 (IHDS-2)====, a publicly available and academically validated data source. Thus, the results obtained in our study are more generalizable in the Indian context. ====, though we investigate, following Das (2015), the effects of ====, the ==== and ==== in the MGNREGS programme on the decision to migrate on a short-term (seasonal) basis, we control for various other socio-economic drivers of migration, not considered in the extant studies. ====, using rigorous quantitative analysis, we check for various interaction effects of those factors with MGNREGS participation, and whether they influence an individual’s decision to migrate. The analyses lead to new and interesting insights, hitherto unavailable in the extant literature.====Our study throws up several insightful results. After controlling for the known drivers of migration and state-level fixed effects, the study finds a ==== impact of MGNREGS on rural out-migration decisions of individuals, the effect being particularly strong in the case of females. Additionally, the analysis suggests that by providing basic livelihood, MGNREGS helps reduce distress migration of relatively disadvantaged strata of the rural society. In contrast, MGNREGS helps realize the aspirations of the marginal labour (coming mainly from the relatively advantaged strata of the society) by providing them with the economic resources necessary to mitigate the risks associated with out-migration.====Based on the novel findings, the paper argues that while the core policy goal of arresting rural out-migration through MGNREGS may not be served, the government needs to look at the impact from a system-wide and intertemporal perspective, ====., the broader and equally critical socio-economic objectives that are served as a result. As the study suggests, MGNREGS does facilitate female (economic) empowerment, reduce distress migration of the economically challenged rural individuals, and promotes aspirational migration of the relatively advantaged rural populace by mitigating the income risks associated with migration. These insights, therefore, help us to draw more nuanced policy conclusions. As a supplemental goal, the paper provides a more grounded and evidence-based policy guidance to the government concerning the expansion path of the country’s largest public works scheme.====The paper adopts the following structure. The next section reviews the extant literature and discusses how our study attempts to address the gaps identified in the literature. Section 3 describes the data and methodology adopted.

Hence the policy variables employed in the study are inclusive development, military expenditure and political stability. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) with forward orthogonal deviations. The paper reports three main findings. Firstly, military expenditure and inclusive development are substitutes and not complements. Secondly, it is more relevant to use political stability as a complement of inclusive development than to use inclusive development as a complement of political stability. Thirdly, it can be broadly established that military expenditure and political stability are complementary. In the light of the sequencing, complementarity and substitutability, when the three policy variables are viewed within the same framework, it is more feasible to first pursue political stability and then complement it with military expenditure and inclusive development.","A number of reasons motivate this study on complementarities between inclusive development, military expenditure and political stability in the fight against terrorism in Africa, namely: growing levels of terrorism in Africa; the tragedy of poverty in the continent; debates revolving around the impact of military expenditure on terrorism; controversies on the relationship between terrorism and political governance; debates surrounding the effect of ‘poverty and human development’ on terrorism and shortcomings in the literature. The motivating factors are discussed in detail below.====Terrorism has been increasing in Africa due to ethnic and tribal tensions, state failures, endemic corruption and religious fundamentalism (Fazel, 2013; Alfa-Wali et al., 2015; Asongu, le Roux et al., 2017; Asongu, Tchamyou et al., 2017). When compared to the Middle East, the continent is not receiving the scholarly attention it deserves (Clavarino, 2014). Some of the notable examples of terrorist organisations that have been affecting livelihoods on the continent include: al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, al-Shabab in Somalia and the Boko Haram in Nigeria. According to a recent publication by the Global Terrorism Index (GTI, 2015), in 2014 the Boko Haram of Nigeria was the deadliest terrorist movement causing 6644 deaths compared to the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) which caused 6073 deaths. Such conflicts have contributed substantially to slowing the path to meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Stewart, 2003).====According to a World Bank (2015) report on achievement of MDGs’ extreme poverty reduction targets, extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa where about 45% of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are considerably off-track from the MDGs extreme poverty reduction target (Tchamyou, 2019, Tchamyou, 2020). This poverty co-exists with more than twenty years of growth resurgence in the continent that commenced in the mid 1990s and questions the overly optimistic narrative of ‘Africa rising’ (Leautier, 2012; Pinkivskiy & Sala-i-Martin, 2014).====This inquiry interrogates whether inclusive development mitigates terrorism by examining whether non-inclusive development experienced by the sampled countries over the past decade is a fundamental cause of terrorism.==== This position complements a recent stream of literature that is questioning World Bank claims about Africa’s growth resurgence by focussing on the non-inclusive character of Africa’s development experience, and arguing, therefore, that a paradigm shift to ‘soft economics’ (or human development) is necessary to understand and confront the continent’s poverty tragedy (Kuada, 2015).====Conflicting views exist on the effect of military spending on terrorism, notably because some consensus has been established in the literature on the counter-effects of military expenditure on terrorism (Feridun & Shahbaz, 2010, p. 195). This consensus argues that counterterrorism policies provide more fuel to terrorist attacks, instead of mitigating and preventing them (Sandler, 2005). Moreover, such counterterrorism policies are ineffective, in part, due to the absence of internationally recognised, comprehensive and long-run policies in the battle against terrorism (Omand, 2005). It is argued, for example, that the United States’ policies in the fight against terrorism are not effective because they boost the chances of terrorism reoccurring (Lum et al., 2006). Feridun and Shahbaz (2010) have established a uni-directional causality from terrorism to military expenditure. We believe that the intuition underpinning the negative relationship between military expenditure and terrorism is still open to debate.====Moreover, there are very conflicting positions in the literature on the relationship between terrorism and governance (Lee, 2013). There is a branch of studies which argues that democratic institutions mitigate resentments towards the management of a country and, therefore, reduce the possibility of recruitment by terrorists’ organisations (Windsor, 2003; Li, 2005). A second strand argues that democratic institutions are not useful in reducing terrorism because the interests of terrorist organisations are not properly enshrined in democratic political institutions (Gause, 2005). In addition, nations with solid political institutions may be associated with high levels of non-inclusive development (see Bass, 2014). A contemporary example that illustrates this perspective is the one relating to European-born and educated youths leaving Europe to join ISIL because of social exclusion (Foster, 2014). In essence, terrorism can be harboured in nations with strong democratic institutions because of a multitude of direct and indirect factors that promote grievances: civil liberties, freedom and access to media and freedom of speech in the expressions of dissatisfaction and disagreement (see Ross, 1993).====The empirical literature on the nexus between poverty, human development and terrorism is very conflicting. Some of the varying conclusions include: a negative relationship between terrorism and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (Li, 2005); no nexus between terrorism and GDP per capita (Krueger & Maleckova, 2003); the absence of causality from human development to terrorism (Piazza, 2006); an increased likelihood of terrorism in poor nations (Abadie, 2006); a positive relationship between terrorism and GDP per capita when the views of victims are considered (Gassebner & Luechinger, 2011); a positive relationship between GDP per capita and transnational terrorism (Blomberg et al., 2004) and economic discrimination of the minority communities influencing domestic terrorism (Piazza, 2011; Singh 2002). With a few exceptions (Piazza, 2011; Li & Schaub, 2004), there has been very little empirical support for the positive nexus between poverty and terrorism.====In particular, there is a need to focus on Africa which is not receiving the scholarly attention it deserves in spite of increasing terrorism levels on the continent and to contribute to the debate on the conflicting roles of military expenditure, inclusive development and political governance by assessing their complementarities in the fight against terrorism. African-oriented literature in the fight against terrorism has focused essentially on: assessing the role of freedoms and poverty on terrorism (Barros et al., 2008); the role of global warming (Price & Elu, 2017); investigating the influence of competition between military companies on the rate at which conflicts are resolved (Akcinaroglu & Radziszewski, 2013); examining the influence of externalities like geopolitical fluctuations (Straus, 2012) and exploring the mission of multilateral institutions by the African Union (Ewi & Aning, 2006).====This inquiry is particularly relevant for sustainable development in the post-2015 development agenda because terrorism threats may create an uncertain economic outlook owing to increasing ambiguity both from local and foreign actors who have been documented to prefer ambiguity-safe economic strategies (Kelsey & le Roux, 2017, 2018). Terrorism has far-reaching consequences such as infrastructural damages, reduction in savings and economic output, higher insurance premiums, trade losses and increasing investment costs (Singh, 2001, 2007; Efobi et al., 2015).====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 engages with the theoretical and empirical underpinnings, while Section 3 discusses the data and methodology.

For the purpose, the current paper uses ==== to understand the impact of OFDI for 14 emerging economies in the period 1981–2019. We supplement the cross-country evidence with a ==== for India, given that FDI outflows from the country have been steadily increasing over the years. The results confirm the positive effect of OFDI on economic growth, but the substitution effect for domestic investment. This indicates that the OFDI positively affects growth through its effect on trade and other positive ====, rather than domestic investment. However, in case of India, the findings support the complementary effect of OFDI on domestic investment.","Over the past few decades, there has been an increase in outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) from emerging countries. In 1995, OFDI from developing countries constituted just 4% of global FDI flows, while in 2014 this share had reached a record 27% (Stephenson & Perea, 2018). OFDI enables such countries to access new markets, resources, technology transfers, knowledge and skills. Firms in developing countries are also exploring new locations for reducing their costs of production, diversifying their investment portfolio to mitigate risks and getting integrated into global value chains. All these positive spillovers can contribute to the economic growth of the investing countries. However, there has been considerable debate whether OFDI is always beneficial to the home country as OFDI from capital deficient countries may reduce domestic investment and thereby, growth. The debate whether OFDI has complimentary or substitution impact on growth and investment is imperative for policy concerns, particularly in the case of capital deficient countries. This is especially important given that the world economy has been experiencing low rates of investment (Sachs, 2016) since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).====The exact impact of OFDI on the home country’s economy tends to vary with the prevailing economic conditions in such countries, depending upon their business environment, financial sector development, absorptive capacities of domestic firms and international linkages. The 2007–08 GFC followed by the debt crisis lead to volatility in the growth experiences of different countries. This in in turn affected their prospects of returns on investments, availability of financial resources and, access to global markets. Such developments have had an effect on the usual channels through which OFDI impacts the economy of the investing country. It is hypothesized that the changing conditions may have altered the direction and magnitude of OFDI’s impact on domestic investment. Understanding OFDI’s implications for domestic investment has become imperative, as the latter remains the focal point for not only raising productivity growth or overcoming secular stagnation, but can also lead to improved future prospects (Eberly, 2020). As a result there has been renewed interest among policymakers to settle the current debate on the OFDI-growth nexus. In this backdrop, our research seeks to address the following research questions: (i) whether OFDI leads to the complementary or substitution effect on domestic investment and, (ii) whether OFDI can contribute to the economic growth of the investing country. Addressing such questions can help in making key policy decisions about resource allocation and financial liberalisation policies pertaining to OFDI.====The last two decades have witnessed a dramatic rise in cross border investment activities by enterprises in developing countries from a broad spectrum of industries (Khan, 2012; Nayyar & Mukherjee, 2020; Sauvant et al., 2010). According to Narula and Nguyen (2011), Asian countries including newly industrialized countries (Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), Malaysia, Brazil, Russia, India and China have remained the key sources of OFDI.==== This phenomenon warrants an empirical study establishing the relationship between OFDI and domestic investment and economic growth for countries actively involved in OFDI activities. Hence the present study relies on a sample of 14 emerging economies, to understand the relationship between OFDI and economic growth in the wake of changing global dynamics, especially post-GFC. To be specific, the paper uses panel data analysis to empirically investigate the effect of OFDI on domestic investment and economic growth for these countries in the period 1981–2019.====In addition, it also applies time series analysis to analyse the country specific effects of OFDI on India during the same period. India has been no exception to the changing landscape of OFDI, as its outward investment has increased from US$ 0.7 billion in 2000–01 to peak at US$ 18.5 billion in 2007–08 and, finally settle at a moderated level of US$ 12.6 billion in 2018–19 (Joseph, 2019).==== Interestingly, India’s domestic investment rose constantly in the beginning of 21==== century and peaked at 35.8% of GDP in 2007, but slowed gradually to 28.9% in 2018 (WDI, 2019). Hence India has been included as a special case study in the current paper, given that the investment outflows from India have been steadily increasing over the past two decades, though moderated in recent years, while its domestic investment rate has slowed since 2007–08. Therefore, assessing the impact of OFDI on its domestic investment and economic growth under a long run equilibrium framework can contribute towards the ongoing debate and has useful policy implications.====As such, the paper is divided into six sections. The next section gives a brief overview of the broader trends with regard to OFDI across the 14 emerging Asian countries. This is followed by a section presenting a literature review of earlier studies analysing the impact of OFDI on domestic investment and growth. Section 4 discusses the panel data methodology and empirical findings for emerging economies. Section 5 describes the India specific empirical findings.

We draw on the theory of long-run competitive equilibrium to estimate the effect of subsidized crop insurance on farm output and number of farms in the U.S. Results show that the subsidy led to fewer and larger farms. To the extent that larger farms benefit disproportionately from other farm subsidies, known to increase farm size, subsidized crop insurance can only contribute to further farm consolidation, with consequences for sustainability and depopulation of rural communities. These unintended effects could make the case for reverting to ad-hoc disaster payment programs.","In the U.S., taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance is now the largest government-provided safety net program. The program represents a culmination of a series of legislative acts, beginning in 1980 with the Federal Crop Insurance Act, followed by the Federal Insurance Reform Act in 1994, and the Agricultural Risk Protection Act (ARPA) in 2000, all aimed at encouraging producer participation through increased premium subsidies and enhanced coverage options (OECD, 2017).====While subsidized crop insurance is not unique to the U.S. (Severini, Biagini, & Finger, 2019; TCS, 2014), it is “the only country providing billions in subsidies for publicly-subsidized gold-plated based insurance which can kick in even after a bountiful harvest,” inevitably producing unintended consequences (TCS, 2014). Economists have identified and examined several unintended consequences with the crop insurance program, such as moral hazard and adverse selection (Mieno, Walters, & Fulginiti, 2018), disincentive to adapt to climate change (Annan & Schlenker, 2015), water use (Deryugina & Konar, 2017), environmental externalities (Weber, Key, & O’Donoghue, 2016), and a host of others (OECD, 2017). The identification of unintended consequences can be helpful to policymakers in rethinking future crop insurance policy design.====One unintended consequence that has been largely overlooked in the literature is farm consolidation, whereby farms are bought out using rents acquired from subsidized insurance and consolidated into larger farms. In theory, the economic mechanism linking subsidized insurance to consolidation is straightforward. A legislative rise in premium subsidies, as was the case through ARPA in 2000, raises expected returns to participation in crop insurance. To the extent that an increase in expected returns induces individual participating farmers to increase crop supply (e.g., Yu, Smith, & Sumner, 2017), they may collectively see their benefit from insurance offset by declining market revenue and non-participating farmers may incur losses as well. That is because the increase in aggregate crop supply induced by participation in subsidized insurance, in the face of inelastic crop demand, results in declining market prices (Young, Vandeveer, & Schnepf, 2001).====By affecting market returns for participating and non-participating farmers alike, subsidized crop insurance may also affect the farm industry's structure in the long-run through changes in farm numbers in response to the interplay between market returns and expected returns from the subsidy. Positive net returns to program participation may give a strategic financial advantage to insurance participants over non-participants. Program participants may outbid financially strapped non-participants in land purchase and rental markets (Roberts & Key, 2008). More importantly, after a rare and adverse event such as a drought, which generally triggers indemnity payments, those with insurance can better compete in the land rental and purchase market due to a substantially better-off financial position. Non-participants in a poor financial position who are losing shares in the land rental and purchase market may exit the industry. These points provide the basis for the question we pose in this paper: Does subsidized crop-insurance affect farm industry structure?====We address the question by drawing on the theory of long-run competitive equilibrium (LRCE) to formulate and empirically implement an economic model that incorporates returns of subsidized insurance participation into producer profit and drives profits to zero in the long run. We use the comparative statics with respect to an increase in the crop insurance premium subsidy through ARPA in 2000 to generate predictions about how changes in the subsidy influence the number of farms and farm output in the longrun.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews related literature. Section 3 lays out the LRCE model and its comparative statics. Section 4 presents the empirical version of the model. Section 5 describes the data.

In a second stage, the model is used to compare the impacts of counterfactual policy scenarios on the Tunisian ====. The results show that the economy could perform much better, in relation to a battery of macroeconomic indicators (economic growth, unemployment, public external and domestic debts, current account, fiscal balance) under alternative economic policies. The most insightful results are obtained under the scenario of a total factor productivity’s growth progressing at its average level of 2001–2010. Indeed, this could generate an average yearly gain in terms of GDP growth of 3.45 percentage points and a reduction of the average unemployment rate by 7 percentage points over the same time horizon.","Tunisia is a lower-middle income country with a small open economy. Since the 2011’s revolution its economic performance is weakening due to various internal and external shocks. The short-term foresight of the macroeconomic management of the Tunisian economy during the period 2011–2018, resulted in the decline of the average economic growth from 4.6% during 2001–2010 to 1.5% over 2011–2019 and the deterioration of the macroeconomic fundamentals==== . The successive governments since 2011 increased social spending and massively hired in the public sector to cope with the rising social unrest and youth unemployment. Conversely, there was no clear progress in undertaking most of the structural reforms related to the business environment, the State owned enterprises (SOEs), the pension system, the huge subsidy budget, the fiscal policy (Nabi, 2019). The current political instability, and the recent crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic are exacerbating the structural weaknesses of the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals.====The successful experiences of the developing countries that achieved higher economic growth over 10–20 years highlights the importance of the efficient public policies in the following five dimensions==== : (i) leadership, governance and inclusion, (ii) accumulation of physical and human capital, (iii) innovation, (iv) efficient functioning of the markets, and (v) macroeconomic stabilization. The present paper aims to provide the policy makers with quantitative arguments showing the importance to undertake the macroeconomic stabilization, and to favour the investment (public and private====), the entrepreneurship, and the growth of the total factor productivity. Firstly, I experiment rebalancing the government expenditures towards more public investment instead of increasing the public wage bill demand and the social transfers. This is done by simulating the scenario of keeping the structure of government expenditure over 2011–2018 similar to that of the reference year 2010. Secondly, I delve into the impacts of different mix between the domestic and external financing of the public deficit. Thirdly, and most importantly, I experiment invigorating the Total factor productivity (TFP) in the Tunisian economy, which represents the main driver of the long-term per capita income growth (Aghion & Howitt, 2009). Indeed, the growth rate of the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) decreased from about 1.7% over the period 2001–2010 to around −1% during the period 2011–2018. This was mainly due to the weak dynamism of the private sector. Indeed, the percentage of the Tunisian firms which invested in innovative products and services decreased from 28% in 2013 to 14% in 2019. This lower investment was accompanied with higher deceleration of their productivity passing from −4.5% in 2013 to −5.1% in 2019 (World Bank, 2020).====The paper contributes to the existing literature using financial CGE models to analyse the impact of various economic policies in a developing country. These models incorporate financial markets and enable the interactions between the financial mechanisms and the real side of the economy (Robinson, 1991). Despite their usefulness for policy makers, there are only few financial CGE models, given the difficulty to construct a Financial Social Accounting Matrix (FSAM). Among the first models, one can cite Bourguignon et al. (1992) which combines the real side of a CGE model with asset portfolio behaviour of macroeconomic models in Tobin's tradition, in order to analyse the impacts of policy changes on the distribution of income and wealth. Yeldan (1997) constructs a CGE model with financial markets to analyse the effects of the external financial liberalization in Turkey on the real economy. The model is used to generate counterfactual and comparative static simulations experiments covering the following issues: (1) the impact of the mode of financing of the fiscal deficit through debt instruments or monetization; (2) the effects of deregulating the rules of issuing the public debt instrument on the financial markets; and (3) the implications of the exchange rate devaluations and external debt servicing. Bennour and Abdessalem (2010) proposes a general framework of a recursive dynamic general equilibrium model, with real and financial parts. It analyses how various modalities of public deficit financing (bonds; seignorage) affect the real economy and income distribution. While the real part of the model generates the saving of each agent, the allocation of saving among the financial assets (modalities) determines the money market equilibrium. In this model, investment does not automatically adjust to savings, and is financed by domestic and foreign borrowing (determined by the financial part of the model). Haqiqi and Mirian (2015) constructs a generic real-financial CGE model incorporating multi-investors, multi-assets, and multi-sectors for policy analysis of a small open economy with imperfect capital mobility. The financial side includes a central bank, commercial banks, deposits, loans, equities, bonds, and foreign currency. The present paper also contributes to the rich literature (e.g. Bchir et al., 2005; Bchir et al., 2010; Chemingui & Thabet, 2007; Konan & Maskus, 2006; Marouani, 2008) having developed CGE models to analyse the impact of various economic policies (trade, agriculture and services liberalization; fiscal reforms) on unemployment, wages and poverty in Tunisia. However, the CGE models developed in the above cited papers do not consider explicitly the financial flows while taking into account the central bank’s role (through the money creation and the policy rate) and its interaction with the financial intermediaries’ role in financing the government and the non-government sector.====In order to realize the objectives of the paper I update and extend the financial dynamic general equilibrium model of de Melo et al. (1989) that was used during the structural economic program undertaken by Tunisia in 1986 under the auspice of the IMF and World Bank. In addition to its calibration using six flow-of-funds accounts representing the Tunisian economy in 2010, a new version of the model is suggested to reflect the evolution of the economic structure during the recent period. The extension is made from several perspectives. First the calibration is made so that the model reproduces the main macroeconomic fundamentals of the Tunisian economy during the period 2011–2018. By considering this calibration approach, this paper has commonality with Condon et al. (1985) and Lovo et al. (2018). Condon et al. (1985) uses a computable general equilibrium model to analyse the growth path of the Chilean economy during 1977–81. During that period the liberalization reforms lead to large macroeconomic imbalances and Chile experienced an abrupt and severe recession in 1982. The study simulated a benchmark path to estimate the magnitude and pattern of growth and productivity change during the 1971–81 period. Then the authors generated counterfactual simulations to assess how Chile's economic performance would have differed if external events and foreign capital inflows had been different. The analysis suggests that the macroeconomic imbalances that led to the crisis in 1982 were exacerbated by the large capital inflows and the real exchange rate appreciation that resulted from the use of the exchange rate as a stabilization device. Lovo et al. (2018) develops a regional dynamic general equilibrium model for the Italian region Valle D’Aosta, using historical calibration over 40 years’ period. As they noted, the CGE model with this calibration approach provides a powerful tool for historical counterfactual analysis not available using standard dynamic general equilibrium models. Lovo et al. (2018) compares the growth path followed by the region with a counterfactual scenario to evaluate how the region would have performed in the case of a contraction of the transfers from the national government to the regional government and the families.====The remaining of the paper contains four main sections. In section II we present the main characteristics of the Tunisian economy. In section III, we present the model specification. Section IV presents the main results of the simulations.

Common challenges of the existing programs remain, including inaccurate target the poor and lack of complementarity between programs. An exercise using a dynamic ","Poverty eradication has been a major global challenge for decades. Countries have agreed on the global agenda of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the aim for “no-poverty” has become the primary goal of the plan (U. Nations, 2015). The agenda suggests eradicating extreme poverty in every country by 2030, in all its forms and dimensions. As the fourth most populous country globally and as a middle-income country, Indonesia should strongly support the agenda.====The Indonesian long-term poverty rate declined from 40.1% to 11.3% between 1970 and 1996. In 1996, BPS-Indonesia Statistics updated the poverty calculation method, under which the new poverty rate became 17.47%. When the 1998 Asian financial crisis hit the economy hard, the poverty rate increased again, to 24.2%. Afterwards, it decreased from 24.2% in 1998 to 9.4% in 2019. Strong economic growth over the past decades mainly contributed to this achievement (Balisacan, Pernia, & Asra, 2003; Dollar & Kraay, 2002).====The challenge of poverty reduction continues to increase as the pace of poverty eradication has slowed in recent years. From 2008 to 2015, the poverty rate declined at an annual rate of 0.8%, while between 2015 and 2019 the declining rate was only 0.31% annually. Suryahadi and Izzati (2018) find that economic growth in Indonesia has become less pro-poor in the last few years. Poverty reduction is becoming more challenging as the poverty rate rests at the lower level. Cruz, Foster, Quillin, and Schellekens (2015) emphasize that it is harder to reach the remaining poor populations due to the structural characteristics within this poorest group. The most significant challenges in poverty reduction might arrive as Indonesia faces its first economic recession in over 20 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Suroyo & Diela, 2020). The pandemic will cause a social dislocation in which millions of people could fall into poverty. Thus, the existing poverty eradication programs should be evaluated to keep pace with the increasing challenges.====Against this setting, this study explores the progress of and challenges to poverty eradication programs in Indonesia, including the social assistance programs and subsidies.==== It aims to trace how the programs have evolved, the challenges faced by each program, and areas for improvement. Consequently, this study proposes reforms for improving the effectiveness of the programs in reducing poverty. It also analyzes the impacts of the proposed reforms on socio-economic indicators using a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model.====This study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, this study provides the most comprehensive analyses of poverty eradication programs in Indonesia to date. It covers not only social assistance programs (including conditional cash transfer, school assistance for poor students, health insurance for poor people, and food assistance) but also subsidies, including the Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), electricity, and fuel subsidies. Previous studies mostly covered only parts of the poverty eradication program; for example, Timmer, Hastuti, and Sumarto (2016); Tabor and Husein Sawit (2001), and Hastuti, Sumarto, Madi, and Prama (2008) analyzed the effectiveness of the food assistance program in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Lee and Hwang (2016); Nazara and Rahayu (2013), Cahyadi et al. (2018), and Arif, Syukri, Isdijoso, Bambang, and Soelaksono (2013) explored the conditional cash transfer program in Indonesia.====Other previous studies by Nugroho, Amir, and Wargadalam (2015) and Clements, Jung, and Gupta (2007) explored the distribution impact of Indonesia’s energy subsidy policy. Dartanto et al. (2015) and Agustina et al. (2019) discussed health insurance contribution assistance. As has been demonstrated in the mentioned literature, any individual program assessment could lead to an upward bias in analysis because the outcome variables may be affected by more than one single program (Tohari, Parsons, & Rammohan, 2019). Thus, evaluation of complementary programs holds an advantage over assessment of individual programs.====Although researchers attempt to analyze complementary programs in Indonesia (see Tohari et al., 2019; Daly & Fane, 2002), they ignore some key poverty alleviation programs in Indonesia, such as the conditional cash transfer program. Their analyses are also missing subsidies, which constitute the most lavish poverty program in the country. According to Maulidia, Dargusch, Ashworth, and Ardiansyah (2019), the Indonesian government’s expenditure on fossil fuel subsidies in 2014 was 31 times greater than their health expenditure.====Second, this study reflects Indonesia’s recent development, making it a realistic case study. Budget allocation for poverty eradication programs has progressively increased, but the rate of poverty reduction has slowed in recent years. The Ministry of Finance (2019a) stated that the government intends to improve spending quality so that the existing poverty eradication programs will be more effective. Besides, because the country is facing a recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the existing poverty programs can also serve as social safety nets to protect vulnerable household groups. Countries that provide more significant social spending record a lower detrimental effect of poverty during a crisis (Kiendrebeogo, Assimaidou, & Tall, 2017).====The third contribution of this study is that it provides the first attempt to exercise reform on complementarity poverty elimination programs in a large developing country using a general equilibrium framework. To the best of our knowledge, no literature has attempted this work before. The proposed reforms are exercised using a recursive dynamic CGE as an improvement over static CGE models. Anderson, Cockburn, and Martin (2011) mention that the CGE models without any dynamics feature could provide misleading results.","Poverty eradication programs in Indonesia: Progress, challenges and reforms",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821000661,30 June 2021,2021,Research Article,118.0

On the one hand, the authors identify the benchmarks and main drivers of judicial inefficiency, while, on the other hand, they show how incorrect model definition may mislead policy makers tackling this reform process, based on an analysis of the Directional Distance Function with and without bad outputs. According to the results, incorrect model definition causes a type I error equal to 17.99% and a type II error equal to 25.18%. As for the determinants of court performance, the current staff structure and civil procedures are the main drivers of inefficiency and, consequently, the areas in which policy makers could successfully take action. In view of the EU’s recovery fund aimed at alleviating the economic impact of Covid-19, policy implications concern the opportunity to adopt these results and the collected benchmarks to drive one of the most important structural reforms in Italy, by leveraging the financial resources of the Next Generation EU package. Such a reform might be able to improve courts’ technical efficiency, while also maintaining the public budget under control.","Public systems in Western Countries are based on ex-ante budget authorizations, whereby governments decide the expenditure levels of public bodies and then, accordingly, these bodies achieve the expected social targets. This mechanism is a fundamental step to maintain public expenditure under control and to support financial sustainability, and its control dynamics are even more relevant in the European Union (EU), where member states have adopted fiscal rules and treaties to limit their debts (De Grauwe, 1996). The crises of the last decades (the global financial crisis in 2008 and the pandemic crisis in 2020) have amplified these problems. Indeed, these crises have pushed the public system to dramatically increase its expenditure in social interventions, shedding new light on the necessity to improve institutional efficiency to contain expenditure and to avoid dramatic, but necessary, trade-offs between interventions. In particular, policy makers could be tasked with correctly identifying the main determinants of inefficiency and the key criteria that may steer the reorganisation of those public interventions, as well as clear efficiency benchmarks, able to provide a picture of the current organisational structure (Gupta & Bolia, 2020). Today, the European policy makers have the incredible opportunity to implement all the necessary structural reforms to support economic growth by adopting the EU’s recovery fund designed to alleviate the economic impact of Covid-19 (Arbolino and Di Caro, 2021). Nevertheless, clear benchmarks are necessary to lead the policy makers in successfully implementing these reforms and making the most of this last opportunity to make Europe once again competitive on the global market.====In this work, we focus on a specific case study, i.e., the Italian judicial system, and on how to shape a policy reform aimed at increasing the efficiency of the courts, taking the externalities created by the production process into account, i.e., considering the additional costs borne by courts to settle cases (i.e., budget externalities). On the one hand, we identify the benchmarks and main drivers of inefficiency, while, on the other hand, we show how incorrect model definition may mislead policy makers in the reform process. In particular, we adopt operations research techniques to estimate efficiency and examine how the results gathered may support this policy reform. The literature on policy modelling proposes several case studies with these techniques to investigate the performance of public institutions such as, for instance, public historical archives (Guccio et al., 2020), healthcare units (Rajasulochana & Chen, 2019) and courts (Gupta & Bolia, 2020). Moreover, the same techniques have been adopted to investigate private SMEs (Yang, 2006; Sahoo & Nauriyal, 2014) and the educational attainments of students (Lagravinese et al., 2020).====The judiciary is a relevant case study since, according to the current literature, an efficient judicial system can support entrepreneurship (Chemin, 2009; Falavigna et al., 2019), as well as companies’ access to the capital market (Ponticelli & Alencar, 2016; Brown et al., 2017) and their investments (Fabbri, 2010; Giacomelli & Menon, 2017). This is even more relevant if we consider that our case study concerns the Italian judiciary, which is one of the most inefficient systems in the European Union (CEPEJ, 2016), clearly in need to improve its institutional environment to support national economic growth (Esposito et al., 2014).====The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the current literature on judicial efficiency, describing the main models adopted by academia in its estimation. Then, assuming that policy makers are interested not only in supplying justice but also in minimizing additional public expenditure, we identify the key elements in the model definition for the benchmarking of judicial courts. Section 3 sets out the methodology adopted to estimate ==== technical efficiency scores (i.e., Directional Distance Function, with and without bad outputs) and applies it to the case study under investigation (i.e., the Italian judicial system).

AP and LAC are predominantly middle-income regions which are at broadly at similar income and development levels. While LAC was substantially richer than AP a few decades ago, AP’s sustained rapid growth has greatly reduced the income gap. Although at broadly similar income levels, the two regions are also marked by significant differences. For example, while AP largely enjoyed macroeconomic stability and pursued outward-looking export-oriented growth strategy, many LAC countries suffered macroeconomic instability and followed inward-looking import substitution growth strategy.====An often-overlooked factor which may have contributed to AP’s superior economic performance vis-à-vis LAC is innovation, which is a key ingredient of economic growth and development (Aghion and Howitt, 1992).==== AP is home to well-known innovative tech giants such as Alibaba, Samsung Electronics and Infosys. On the other hand, one would be hard-pressed to name innovative tech companies from LAC. In this regard, the central objective of our paper is to analyze and compare innovation in the two regions. Our approach is different from most empirical analysis of the determinants of innovation that have delved into advanced economies that are at or near the global technological frontier. Relatively little analysis delves into innovation patterns and determinants in the catch-up economies, and even less about differences in innovation patterns among developing economies.====Going forward, innovation holds the key to productivity growth, which assumes a larger role in economic growth at middle income (ADB, 2017). The transition from low income to middle income is based largely on deployment of more factors—i.e. capital and labor. However, the transition from middle income to high income requires both factor accumulation and productivity, which is inherently more difficult. The success of Korea and other NIEs in moving up to high income underline the central importance of innovation and productivity growth. Fig. 1 illustrates the relationship between innovation (as measured by patents) and GDP per capita growth in the two regions. These variables are positively associated, which suggests that AP and LAC economies need to innovate to sustain economic growth.====Overall, the stylized facts indicate that AP innovates more than LAC. AP countries invest more in innovative activity and produce more innovative output. Therefore, the data lend some support to the notion that greater innovation helps explain why AP economies outperformed LAC economies. However, there is a lot of heterogeneity across countries and subregions. High and upper-middle income countries play a disproportionate role in innovation in both regions. Our empirical analysis of the determinants of innovation indicates that research and development, human capital, infrastructure access, and financial development has a positive effect. In particular, our evidence points to the central importance of human capital in innovation.

The extent of the (positive or negative) effects is very much related to whether the structure of production (i.e., sectors’ weight in GDP) of the different economies is similar to (and therefore more easily crowded out by) Chinese booming sectors.","Many governments seek policies to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and try to take part in global production networks. FDI has played a vital role in moving the center of manufacturing from the North to the South (Chen & De Lombaerde, 2014; Baldwin, 2016). The rise of China as a production center and engine of world growth, as well as, the huge FDI inflows it has received has raised many discussions (Lin, 2016). In this paper we provide quantitative evidence on the main mechanisms by which FDI inflows accruing to China interact with global production networks. We focus on flows going to manufactures, that have for long dominated Chinese FDI inflows and given rise to “Factory Asia” (Baldwin, 2016; Baldwin, 2011). We aim at replying to relevant policy questions such as: Should countries engage in global production networks? Which are the determinants of the failure or success in taking part in those networks? What are the main micro and macroeconomic outcomes of FDI inflows accruing to China? What does, then, the ʻMade in Chinaʼ really mean? What can other regions expect from it?====Most of the analyses on production networks and trade regionalization have been carried out using gravity models, intensity indices or network analysis tools (Iapadre & Tajoli, 2014). By contrast, in this paper we use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, which considers the interplay of six regions in which the world economy has been split and has a long tradition as a prominent tool for policy analysis (Dixon & Rimmer, 2016). The six regions are: China, East Asia, Japan, EU28, the U.S. and the group of Emerging and Developing Economies (EMD)==== . This technique allows us to model the impact of FDI, which has seldom been modelled using CGEs (see Latorre, 2009; Tarr, 2012; Fernández-Pacheco et al., 2018).====By means of our CGE model we can combine the interaction of a wide set of macro and microeconomic variables. In addition, several aspects of FDI and production networks can be studied, such as its differential impact across networks, sectors, countries or regions, depending on technologies of production, export orientation and import reliance, among other factors. Our approach incorporates the real data on total costs and production in the different sectors of the regions we consider, and their multiple foreign trade connections through networks, which underlie their corresponding results at higher levels (such as GDP growth, aggregate foreign trade and welfare). In this sense, we go beyond the approach taken by the few multi-country general equilibrium models which explicitly consider FDI (such as, Arita & Tanaka, 2014; Burstein & Monge-Naranjo, 2009; Costas et al., 2013; McGrattan & Prescott, 2009; Ramondo, 2014; Ramondo & Rodríguez-Clare, 2013) and fail to offer any impact across sectors in the economy. Their analyses have relied in most cases on aggregates of manufacturing sectors, which we disaggregate, while we also cover services sectors and the entire economy.====The model, thus, captures the presence of Asian production networks, together with the main destinations of final and intermediate goods produced by China. Lin and Wang (2018), using the datasets of ‘valued-added exports’ derived in the global input-output analysis of Johnson and Noguera (2012) and Johnson (2014), obtain that imported intermediates to China keep increasing and that China has become more and more integrated in a global production network. However, in this paper, we go beyond the data describing the presence of networks and try to quantify the consequences of the particular linkages of each region, country and sector with the Chinese economy. This should be of interest for the policy maker.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the role of the different regions as production centers, intermediate suppliers and final markets. Section 3 presents the model and simulations.

While macroprudential policies are critical for financial stability and are targeted at making the financial system safer (Duca, Popoyan, & Wachter, 2019; Kashyap, Berner, & Goodhart, 2011; Nakatani, 2020), one externality of such policies is a likely fall in the number of households entering homeownership (Basto, Gomes, & Lima, 2019; Whitehead & Williams, 2017). The salience of this access to credit issue is accentuated by the recovery observed in both house prices and rents across many markets post 2013, which pose considerable challenges to would be borrowers.====With macroprudential regulations being a new and permanent reality for the housing market, there is a clear requirement to better understand credit access and the various constraining factors across the entire pool of potential homeowners. In particular, are potential first time borrowers unable to access credit because they are inherently high credit risk, or are they constrained by current macroprudential and interest rate stress test regulations or is their inability to source mortgage credit due to traditional credit constraints such as borrower discouragement or credit rejections?====To address this question, in this paper, we use a microsimulation model of current rental households in Ireland to quantify the impacts of credit constraints more broadly, as well as macroprudential policies, on the full pool of potential borrowers. This can be thought of as an examination of credit access at the extensive margin, rather than the more common intensive margin approach. The results of the microsimulation model are then used to test the effectiveness of both a public mortgage and an equity scheme policy intervention on improving access to credit. Finally, we extend our method to test the impact of our proposed instruments on house prices.====The Irish case is of interest for several reasons. A significant credit bubble which preceded 2007 subsequently gave way to a significant contraction in lending after 2008. The implementation of stringent macroprudential regulations in the Irish market resulted in applicants who would typically be deemed creditworthy being rejected for credit by Irish financial institutions (McCoy & Wachter, 2017). This reduction in lending in the mortgage market, highlighted by Kelly and Mazza (2019) and Gaffney (2019), has also been accompanied by significant rental price inflation since 2014 (RTB, 2019). The significant affordability challenges faced by those in the private rental sector (Corrigan, Foley, McQuinn, O’Toole, & Slaymaker, 2019) increases the salience of the access to credit issue.====While we deploy our approach on the Irish case, we feel the methodological structure we proposed here could be calibrated to any market once survey data is available at the household level and time series data on house prices, credit and incomes at an aggregate level. For example, any EU country who collects data from the European Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) could easily replicate our framework.====Our approach uses a novel survey of potential first-time buyer mortgage demand to characterise which households currently in the Irish private rental sector have a latent demand for homeownership. Then, by matching on observable characteristics, we merge this likelihood of credit demand to the Irish Survey on Income and Living Conditions. This enables us to test whether current rental households with mortgage credit demand would qualify for a mortgage based on their credit risk, wealth, income, affordability and regional house prices. Our method follows Kelly, McCann, and O’Toole (2018) and assigns each household a potential borrowing amount and house price, given how their savings, income, and other characteristics interact with the Central Bank of Ireland’s macroprudential policy and regional house prices.====This method separates the latent demand for credit into three groups: a) “bankable” demand of potential borrowers who could feasibly obtain credit given current regulations and current house prices; b) the level of demand from those who are unable to borrow due to macroprudential regulations on loan-to-value, loan-to-income or repayment capacity limits; and c) the proportion of the market that would not be feasible to lend to under a prudent credit risk assessment. Aggregating across all households with bankable demand gives a micro-based measure of potentially serviceable credit demand in the Irish economy. Comparing this with aggregate levels of credit approvals allows us to examine whether there is evidence of a credit gap. Finally, we then test the extent to which two policy interventions, a public mortgage or an equity scheme, could be effective in improving credit access. Naturally, as any increase in the number of mortgage credit loans approved would increase the level of credit in the economy, using a fully modified OLS macroeconomic model of credit and house prices, we assess the extent to which the interventions would lead to house price inflation.====Our work is most closely related to Allen, Grieder, Peterson, and Roberts (2020) who use a microsimulation model to examine the impacts of macroprudential policy changes on first time borrowers’ behaviour in Canada. The study is the first in the existing literature to consider a micro-data based framework which separates credit access issues into banking constraints, macroprudential rules and poor credit risk for the entire pool of potential first time buyers. The method addresses a key policy issue in the housing market and provides a replicable model to consider policy interventions to address credit access issues.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the specific policy issue we address and the modelling framework.

We used the generalised method of moment panel vector ","This study investigates the dynamic causal relationship between institutions, economic growth, renewable energy, and CO==== emissions for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Recently, research on the environment–energy–economic growth nexus has become a hot topic in energy and environmental economics because of its associated policy implications. Climate change continues to be the biggest threat to human and economic development (Acheampong, 2019; Farzanegan and Markwardt, 2018; Oh & Lee, 2004; Sethi, Chakrabarti, & Bhattacharjee, 2020). Unless immediate action is taken to mitigate the effects of climate change, the overall cost has been approximated to be a permanent 5% loss of global GDP forever,==== but be as much as 20% if a broader range of impacts and risks are considered (Stern, 2007). However, many scholars are drawing attention to the costs of climate change, arguing that about 1% of GDP would need to sacrifice. Sacrificing GDP to that extent could be damaging the current global economic position and slowing down future growth (Apergis & Payne, 2010b; Apergis & Payne, 2014; Bhattacharya, Awaworyi Churchill, & Paramati, 2017; Bhattacharya, Paramati, Ozturk, & Bhattacharya, 2016). To mitigate climate change and global warming, there has been a call to reduce carbon (CO====) emissions. Thus, there is high and increasing interest in CO==== emissions mitigation by international organisations and nations (e.g. small island nations in the Pacific region and elsewhere) to control and reduce the adverse impact of climate change and global warming (Jafari, Othman, & Nor, 2012; Tamazian, Chousa, & Vadlamannati, 2009).====Despite desperate attempts by international organisations to reduce CO==== emissions, global emissions are increasing astronomically. The International Energy Agency (IEA) (2018) report indicate that in 2017, global CO==== emissions increased by 1.4%. Thus, globally, CO==== emissions rose by 460 million ton (Mt) in absolute terms and reaching an unprecedented high level of 32.5 gigatons (Gt), after a three (3)-year period of stagnation. Climate scientists have been warning the world over the past two to three decades about the need for a sharp reduction in CO==== emissions to meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change (IEA, 2018). The consistent increase in global CO==== emissions suggests that current efforts by policymakers are insufficient to meet the objectives of the Paris agreement on climate change (IEA, 2018).====It is argued that the greatest offender in the rising level of global CO==== emissions is fossil fuel consumption (Dong et al., 2018; Jardón, Kuik, & Tol, 2017; Vlachou, Vassos, & Andrikopoulos, 1996). Therefore, to reduce CO==== emissions, replacing fossil fuel energy with an alternative energy source that is clean is critical for sustainable development. Renewable energy has been the most effective and optimal alternative to fossil fuel and widely accepted pathway towards the mitigation of climate change (Apergis & Payne, 2010b, Apergis & Payne, 2010c, Apergis & Payne, 2011, Apergis & Payne, 2014; Bhattacharya et al., 2017, 2016; Dong et al., 2018; Sadorsky, 2009). Furthermore, the global concerns associated with the rising prices and the volatility of fossil fuel energy supply have not only make renewable energy the pathway to address climate change but also the best strategy to improve energy security, efficiency, and accessibility (Menyah & Wolde-Rufael, 2010). These merits associated with renewable energy have made it received much attention in the sustainable development debate.====Because of climate change, energy security, energy accessibility and energy efficiency awareness, the goal of most economies is to achieve a balance among three critical policy objectives. These critical policy objectives include (1) to achieve energy security by increasing the share of renewable energy sources in the total energy mix, (2) to lower CO==== emissions by giving priority to renewable energy and discourage the use of fossil fuel energy and, (3) to work towards sustainable economic growth (Bhattacharya et al., 2017; Soytas & Sari, 2006).====Balancing these policy objectives in an integrated framework is a challenge to both policymakers and analyst. However, researchers have begun utilising an integrated approach to investigate the dynamic causal relationship between renewable energy, CO==== emissions and economic growth==== (for instance, Acheampong, 2018; Apergis & Payne, 2014; Bélaïd & Youssef, 2017; Ito, 2017; Lu, 2017; Menyah & Wolde-Rufael, 2010; Zeb, Salar, Awan, Zaman, & Shahbaz, 2014). Although these studies are relatively few and still at the infant stage, the empirical findings remain contradictory (see Adewuyi & Awodumi, 2017; Ito, 2017; Lu, 2017; Ozcan, Tzeremes, & Tzeremes, 2019). For instance, Arminen and Menegaki (2019) indicate that with the limited studies and the contradictory findings, further research is needed to reconcile or advance knowledge on the dynamic relationship between energy, CO==== emissions and economic growth. Furthermore, little is known about the dynamic relationship between energy, CO==== emissions and economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa (Adewuyi & Awodumi, 2017). Additionally, as institutions are found to shape economic growth (Acemoglu, Gallego, & Robinson, 2014; Acemoglu & Johnson, 2005; Acemoglu, Johnson, & Robinson [hereafter AJR], 2005), the environment and energy (Abid, 2016, 2017; Bhattacharya et al., 2017; Omri, 2014; Cadoret & Padovano, 2016; Stern, 2012), it is important to incorporate institutions in the energy–CO==== emissions–economic growth nexus (Bhattacharya et al., 2017; Arminen & Menegaki, 2019).====With these knowledge gaps, this paper extends the limited literature by using an integrated framework approach to investigate the dynamic causal relationship between institutions, economic growth, renewable energy, and CO==== emissions for 45 SSA countries for the period between 1960−2017. Using the integrated framework to study the causal linkages between institutional quality, energy, economic growth, and CO==== emissions help to avoid the problem of misspecification and present important policy recommendation (Acheampong, 2018; Ang, 2007, 2008; Soytas & Sari, 2009; Soytas, Sari, & Ewing, 2007). In achieving the goal of this study, two important questions are addressed by this paper. (1) What is the impact and direction of causality between institutional quality, renewable energy, economic growth, and CO==== emissions in SSA? (2) Do the dynamic causal relationships between institutions–renewable energy-growth–CO==== emissions differ between countries with different historical/institutional legacies in SSA?====This study is focused on SSA because the region contributes less to global CO==== emissions but pays/bears the highest cost associated with climate change. While SSA is the minor emitter of CO==== emissions globally, CO==== emissions from this region have been rising recently, and this has raised concerns among policymakers (Acheampong, 2019). It is suggested that if pragmatic policy measures are not taken to limit the growth of CO==== emissions in SSA, it will stymie its economic development. Furthermore, SSA is at the forefront of the implementation of the Sustainable Energy for All (SEE4ALL) goals, which includes improving energy efficiency, energy accessibility, and increasing the share of clean and renewable energy. The IEA (2014) report indicates that only 290 million people out of the entire SSA population of 915 million have access to energy while people without access to energy have been increasing. The report also suggests that increasing the share of renewable energy in the SSA total energy mix could potentially increase energy accessibility and energy efficiency while mitigating CO==== emissions. Although SSA is renewable energy-rich region, renewable energy has been a standstill in the region. Economic growth in SSA has been weak, and observation indicates that the region’s economic growth has been recovering, thereby increasing its GDP per capita. It is also argued that SSA countries have weak or extractive institutions, which have rendered most of their policies inefficient (AJR, 2003, 2001). Therefore, results that will emanate from this study would help guide policymakers in designing future economic, energy and environmental policies as well as institutional reforms. These reasons make it prudent to study the dynamic causal relationship between institutions, economic growth, renewable energy, and CO==== emissions in SSA.====This study makes several distinct contributions to the literature. First, this study augments the economic growth–renewable energy–CO==== emissions nexus with institutions, and such augmentation prevents variable omission bias. Second, this study utilises the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct a composite measure for institutions using the six governance indicators (voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, the rule of law and control of corruption). Third, the institutional economics literature argues that the rate of economic growth, renewable energy adoption and the level of CO==== emissions differ between countries with different institutions (Acemoglu, Johnson, & Robinson, 2001, 2002; Bhattacharya et al., 2017). Despite this argument, previous studies fail to consider institutional origin or heterogeneities among countries when studying the dynamic linkages between economic growths, energy, and CO==== emissions. In this regard, this study further conducts sensitivity analysis by disaggregating the full sample into three main sub-samples based on the countries’ institutional origin/colonial heritage to examine the variation in our results. Finally, this study employs the recently developed generalised method of moment panel vector autoregression (GMM-PVAR) estimator to investigate the dynamic relationship between institutions, economic growth, renewable energy, and CO==== emissions. The results from the GMM-PVAR, which is a sophisticated econometric technique, are efficient and robust as it employs the GMM approach to estimate the relationship and test the causality between the variables. This econometric technique prevents endogeneity and further makes its estimates consistent and robust.","Renewable energy, CO",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821000533,24 May 2021,2021,Research Article,123.0

First, the paper addresses a concern of (what is now becoming known as) “financial stability policy” whose monitoring framework rests heavily on simple indicators of a descriptive nature that are far from being perfect. Second, it explores the issue of measuring financial intermediation in a comprehensive manner. The connection between these two directions is the loan-to-deposit [LTD] ratio, a structural indicator used to capture potential risks associated with liquidity and funding of commercial banks. There are views that macroprudential policy should be built around the LTD ratio (European Systemic Risk Board, 2014; Satria et al., 2015; van den End, 2016) and there is also evidence that the LTD ratio is an apt indicator of financial fragility (Jordà et al., 2021). Nonetheless, this evidence also suggests that it fails to be an early warning sign, which leaves regulators with the task of reviewing the LTD ratio for a given moment. This paper argues that the LTD ratio alone is a descriptive indicator and that it lacks the normative function. The reason being, it omits information about missed potential in financial intermediation [FI] in spite of the fact that FI is the raison d’être of the financial system with both beneficial and harmful effects. As to the former, there is a long-standing debate about the role of finance for economic growth, the so-called finance-growth nexus (see, e.g., Levine, 2005, pp. 888–921; Hassan et al., 2011, pp. 89–90; Popov, 2018). As to the latter, FI in conjunction with financial development [FD] can trigger financial imbalance in emerging market economies (Demekas, 2019, p. 7). Hence, there is an undiminished need of financial stability policy and regulatory practice to employ and have available some handy quantitative descriptors of financial systems and of their development. Although regulatory and academic texts swarm with the emphasis put on FI, it continues to be measured by the simple LTD ratio, which as a metric of liquidity (mis)match appertains to banking financial intermediaries and is perhaps most apposite for bank-based financial systems or for the banking part of a financial system.====The paper offers financial stability policy a non-trivial instrument that is yet simple in construction and that improves considerably upon the descriptive LTD ratio by providing information whether there is scope for improvement in FI. Since FI is the quintessential and primal role of finance in an economy, the consideration is that a financial system should accomplish FI at the best of its abilities so that discrepancy or residue between funds collected from surplus agents and funds dispersed among deficit agents be minimal. Toward this end, a metric for measuring FI is proposed, referred to here as the financial intermediation measure (FIM), being computable from data on financial systems made available to the general public and updated by the World Bank as part of its research activities. Two data sets are useful in this regard: the Global Financial Development Database [GFDD, see Beck et al., 2018] and the Financial Development and Structure Dataset [FDSD, see World Bank, 2019]. The reliance of this metric upon structural data by the World Bank makes it fully replicable at discretion.====Grounded in a framework of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and tailored to the needs of financial stability policy, the FIM is defined as a factor by which the actually observed LTD ratio must be adjusted to reach the greatest attainable value with respect to an upper-bound required to exclude too risky levels. The benchmark value of the FIM is one and other values should be interpreted as suboptimal: greater values signifying poorer FI, whereas smaller values pointing to suspiciously high amounts of loans made in comparison to amounts of deposits collected. A sheer advantage of the FIM over a number of structural indicators (such as bank deposits to GDP, bank credit to GDP, bank liquid reserved to bank assets etc.) is that the FIM is more informative, renders them redundant and supplants them effectively as one number. A drawback of the FIM is that it focuses upon banking FI and thus its description is less relevant for market-based financial systems. The usefulness of the FIM is demonstrated with panel data sourced from the World Bank’s FDSD. The demonstrational case study covers 48 financial systems of the world classified using four distinct criteria and is elaborated for the period spanning from 1993 to 2016. The demonstration is designed to touch some important choices necessitating the use of the methodology behind the FIM.====A first endeavour to measure FI is, however, owing to Boďa and Zimková (2018, 2020) who devised indices for use with (cross-section or panel) micro-data on individual banks in order to measure their specific attainment in FI, and these are not directly applicable to financial systems.====The remainder of the paper is organized into four more sections.

This result supports the hypothesis that policies that create social value, such as the reallocation to social-driven organizations, are more effective than those targeted to public and political institutions.","Organized crime is a pervasive and global threat. It is one of the biggest winners of globalization whose influence has diffused within the economic and social realities of our society. Its widespread influence encompasses a variety of activities, including trafficking of drugs, people, weapons, and money-laundering.====Criminal activity at a global scale challenges the international community both in different realms (e.g. academics, policymakers, and practitioners), and at different levels (supranational, national, and subnational). However, despite the global efforts, the results are still rather unsatisfactory. A critical issue in this respect lays on the lack of information and analysis. Of course, once considered the peculiar nature of criminal activity, this does not come as a surprise. Indeed, by nature, criminal activity is hidden and very difficult to measure, despite the massive recent improvement in data quality and availability. These difficulties, in turn, have a negative effect on the way economic (quantitative) analysis has contributed to the cause. Machin and Marie (2014), referring to sociology and psychology, talk about historical ====. In addition, since the policy is more and more required to be evidence-based, the limited empirical results on crime unavoidably impacts both the design and the implementation of effective anti-crime policies. For the United Nations.====Such an evidence-based policy, on the economic side, calls for a higher emphasis placed on quantitative methods. Methodologically, this mainly builds upon the use of natural and field experiments in order to develop a deeper understanding of both causes of crime and the efficiency of different policy tools (Cook et al., 2013). This is particularly relevant for the case of money laundering and alike. Since criminal activities are generally carried without a clear political agenda, they are ====, in the sense that the economic motive is somewhat their unique driver (Costa, 2010).==== Hence, the economic profitability and the yields generated by illicit assets are pivotal aspects both in terms of analysis and policy. Put differently, if money laundering is of critical importance because it enables the criminal to enjoy the resulting profits without jeopardizing their source, more generally, preserving the source of income is a crucial aspect of the illicit business. Tackling this issue is of foremost importance in designing anti-crime policies,==== and the relevance of this perspective is recognized in Article 31 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which states that====The same Convention encourages also collaborative activities at the international and regional level, promoting the measures contained in Article 31. The exchange of information on both policy implementation and evaluation is unavoidable in order to improve the effectiveness of anti-crime strategies. This, in turn, will improve the ability to prevent criminal organizations from benefiting from illicit proceeds and to release the pressure of criminal business on the legal economy. Such an issue became especially relevant in recent years as a result of the growing process of liberalization of capital circulation among countries, which facilitated the spread of illegal capital flows all over the world. Not surprisingly, we trace the rise of more targeted policies toward organized crime only in the late ‘80s. Before that, criminal policy was mainly considered as a matter of private law in restoring the victims of crime, while penal intervention was intended to prevent the development of crime (Kilchling, 2014). The first powerful policy against organized crime was the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, passed in the USA as part of The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (its widespread use began in the late 1970 in New York City, where five mafia “families” had established a monopoly in the construction industry).==== The RICO Act allowed FBI agents to use the tool of asset confiscation for members of mafia-type organizations. Then, in 1990, the Council of Europe Convention encouraged the confiscation with the purpose of fighting criminal activity. The main insight was that, when dealing with criminal organization, it is less effective to punish the criminals (who can easily be replaced by others) rather than the organization itself. The rationale of this new paradigm departs from Becker’s (1968) idea of making criminal revenues less profitable by increasing the likelihood of punishment for wrongdoers, and involves not only the international cooperation, but also the system of confiscation rules as a preventive deterrent for crime. This paved the way to a modern finance-related strategy of crime control based on the acquisition of wealth and properties.====A predominant role in this new anti-criminal strategy is played by the banking system and financial intermediaries, through which illegal revenues are cleaned up and invested in legal areas. National and supranational systems must be efficient enough to be able to detect and prevent money laundering schemes. The Financial Action Task Force, established in 1989, and active in more than 200 countries, provides a set of 40 recommendations, periodically updated, to protect the global financial system from criminal infiltration. The two main issues are represented by the access to bank and financial records and the obligation to report suspicious transactions. The global and complex network of financial transactions and money flows makes it extremely difficult to prevent the cleaning of illicit proceeds. Moreover, anti-money laundering policies are not uniformly implemented in all countries. While a strict financial regulation is required, policy interventions may end up being ineffective if they are designed to address the symptoms and not the causes of illegal transactions (Ferwerda, 2009; Barone & Masciandaro, 2011; Chong & Lopez-De-Silanes, 2015).====Our research focuses on those policies targeted to seizure, confiscation and management of assets derived from organized crime. Different regulatory and legislative approaches are currently used in various countries depending upon the law system (civil or common law), the type of organized crime to punish (most of the policies are mainly targeted to fight drug trafficking or terrorism financing), and the legal models that extend or limit the confiscation policy.==== We direct our focus to the last step of the confiscation policy, and thus on the subjects who ultimately benefit from the intervention. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2017) specifies six categories of beneficiaries: state or general revenue funds; special or dedicated funds; law enforcement agencies; recovery programs; crime victims; social reuse. In the USA, the main confiscation fund is primarily used for operational and investigative purposes against criminal organizations. In other countries, such as South Africa, Mexico and Australia, revenues are devoted to prevention activities and to the support of the victims.====Italy is the country with the longest experience with the use of confiscation policies. One of the peculiar features of the Italian mafia is the strong engagement with local and national politics, to the extent that their relationship appears to be embedded in what might be called a “culture of corruption” (Corrado & Rossetti, 2018). Specifically, we analyze the impact on electoral competition in Sicily of two anti-mafia policies: the dismissal of municipal councils for mafia infiltration (DC policy), and the seizure and reassignment of assets owned by the mafia (SR policy). Our underlying hypothesis is that the strong connection between the mafia and politics in Sicily is evidenced by the degree of vote concentration at the municipal level. “Criminals use weapons and violence, but also money and bribes to buy elections, politicians and power” (Costa, 2010, p.650).====We consider the two anti-mafia policies separately in order to disentangle the effects of the one with a strong political content (DC policy) from those of the one with more economic content (SR policy). If the main drivers of the mafia are of social nature, we should observe at least a more pronounced effect of DC policies. In terms of political economy, this would be read in favor of the well-known Polanyi’s argument that the economy is to be embedded in social relations and not the contrary (Polanyi, 1947), and this would also apply to the mafia phenomenon. Conversely, if the presence of the mafia is mainly based upon a strict economic motive, we should empirically observe a stronger effect of SR policies.====The main results of this paper are that: ====) DC policies have no significant effect on the concentration of votes at the municipal level; ====) SR policies significantly reduce the concentration, but only if the assets and property are reassigned to local communities. The underlying intuition seems to be that the best way to deal a serious blow to the mafia is an intervention that poses a threat to its economic and financial interests. This is in line with the insight of public prosecutor Giovanni Falcone, who suggested that, in the fight against the mafia, we should ""follow the money"" (""====""). But, more specifically, we find here that, as far as electoral competition is concerned, positive results are obtained only by reassigning mafia assets to social purposes.====In the analysis, we make the implicit assumption that the electoral outcomes can be manipulated by the activity of criminal or, more generally, powerful interest groups. This activity is one of the distinctive features of the “culture of mafia” in Sicily, and part of its pervasive role in the whole territory. The data published in 2016 by the Italian Anti-mafia Investigation Department (DIA), illustrated by the shaded areas in Fig. 1, confirms the persistent presence of families and organized groups whose members (are suspected to) belong to the mafia in Sicily (sadly, the light areas mostly correspond to Mount Etna and Madonie and Nebrodi natural parks).==== Providing an overview of the countless number of Sicilian politicians involved in illicit or criminal activities is beyond the scope of this paper. Here, we only call the reader’s attention to the fact that two Sicilian governors have recently been sentenced for their involvement with organized crime: Salvatore Cuffaro for mafia association in 2012, and Raffaele Lombardo (sentenced in first instance and currently before the trial of appeal after the referral of the supreme court) for electoral fraud in 2017.====Hence, based on the above arguments, the pervasiveness of the mafia across Sicilian communities raises the opportunity for an empirical investigation about its potential relationship with the electoral momentum, on the one side, and the effectiveness of anti-mafia policies, on the other. It is worth stressing here, explicitly placing it at the forefront, the circumstance that our analysis shares with other studies concerning the mafia: attempting to measure something that by definition, and deliberate mission, does not want to be observed and measured by any institutional statistics. This does not translate, of course, in the mafia not being willing to manifest itself as an informal institution (Helmke & Levitsky, 2004). However, departing from the approach based on ==== assessment, its measurement by any forms of primary and secondary data is necessarily made by ==== somehow trying to capture its effects and empirical manifestation rather than its presence ====. To what extent this poses a limitation to the current and similar studies is an element we acknowledge we cannot assess. Nonetheless, we can argue that our results that only the reassignment of assets to social purposes represents an effective policy are interpreted according to the paradigm of the extant literature, and they are robust to different econometric specifications.====In the literature, it is well established that organized crime can use violence and intimidation both to manipulate the political outcomes ==== an election (Daniele & Dipoppa, 2017), and to alter political selection ==== an election (Alesina et al., 2018; Pinotti, 2013). More in detail, with specific reference to Sicily, Alesina et al. (2018) argue that====On a more empirical basis, the five main implications drawn from their theoretical model (especially assumption P3, “==== p. 471)==== are consistent with the assumption on vote concentration. On a similar premise, in their attempt to explore (the causes and) the consequences of the Sicilian mafia, Acemoglu et al. (2020) argue that its impact on the concentration of votes has been strong and persistent during the time sample represented by the latter part of the 20th century. In their work, they find====As for the institutional channels through which this process operates, the mafia can infiltrate directly into political parties, and shift votes to select or support candidates, so as to have trustworthy middlemen when it is time to talk business (see Bandiera, 2003). There is both empirical and anecdotal evidence showing the mafia is heavily involved in a shadow market for votes, especially in Sicily. For example, De Feo and De Luca (2017) focus on the relationship between the Sicilian mafia and electoral results in Italy in the period 1946–1992. They show that the mafia supported the ==== (Christian Democratic Party) in Sicily, in exchange for economic support, to strategically weaken the ==== (Italian Communist Party).==== Analyzing the period 1994–2013, Buonanno et al. (2016) report a strong association between the share of votes received in the national elections by the party ==== (founded by Silvio Berlusconi) and mafia activity in Sicilian municipalities. As argued by the authors, mafia organizations have the adverse ability to collect votes through threats or small rewards to citizens, and offer them to (local or central state) politicians in exchange for public jobs or contracts and favorable legislation. And, of course, buying and selling of votes is not a is not a unique feature of the Sicilian mafia, as emphasized for instance by Baland and Robinson (2008) for the pre- and post-secret ballot in Chile, and by Acemoglu et al. (2013) for the violence monopolists in Colombia.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical work investigating the relationship between anti-mafia policies and electoral competition, and the first analysis that disentangles the effects of different reassignment policies. The literature on anti-mafia interventions, although steadily growing in recent years, is rather sparse. Daniele and Geys (2015) report that DC policies have a positive effect on the average level of education of Italian politicians. Esposito and Ricci (2015) analyze SR policies in Italy to evaluate how public disvalue (that is, public value destruction) generated by the mafia activity can be turned into public value. Operti (2018) finds that the seizure of mafia firms has contrasting effects on regional new firm entry rates, which may even decrease in the absence of a well-functioning State. Ferrante et al. (2019) show a positive relationship between the mafia and the degree of concentration in the construction sector in Sicily and argue that SR policies can increase competition.====The rest of the paper is as follows.

Our results are robust to alternative model specifications and highlight the importance of financial inclusion and informality in influencing inclusive growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.","In the last two decades, despite tremendous efforts globally to reduce extreme poverty, Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries continue to experience rising poverty levels (International Monetary Fund [IMF], 2020a; World Bank, 2020a). Since the 2007–2008 global financial crisis (GFC) and intermittent shocks, coupled with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the economic growth trajectory has fluctuated in both developed and developing countries. This has led to increased volatility of economic growth across countries, especially in SSA, and has impacted on economic activities. In particular, since the GFC, there has been a considerable increase in the number of informal jobs, which serve as a source of employment in low-income countries (Golub & Hayat, 2015; Heintz, 2012; International Labour Organization [ILO], 2002; IMF, 2020a, 2020b; Oosthuizen et al., 2016). These events have led to renewed debate about the role of economic growth in reducing poverty (see Barro, 2000; Dollar et al., 2016; Fosu, 2009; Kraay, 2006; Ravallion & Chen, 2003). Thus, the failure of countries to reduce poverty has been attributed to the lack of inclusiveness of growth policies implemented to improve the economic wellbeing of the citizenry (see Aoyagi & Giovanni, 2015; Dinda, 2014; Mlachila et al., 2017; Oosthuizen et al., 2016; Stiglitz, 2016). In this paper, inclusive growth is defined as growth within an economy that creates opportunities and ensures equitable distribution of income to the populace (see De Haan, 2015; McKinley, 2010; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2014).====A growing number of studies has emerged explaining the role of inclusiveness in reducing poverty (African Development Bank [AfDB], 2013, 2016; Ali & Son, 2007; Anand et al., 2013; Dinda, 2014). Despite their theoretical and empirical contributions, the conclusions of previous studies have been complex and unresolved. Some attribute differences in empirics to how inclusive growth is measured (McKinley, 2010; Ranieri & Ramos, 2013; Rauniyar & Kanbur, 2010). In particular, while some authors have used income-based measure (Anand et al., 2013; Aoyagi & Giovanni, 2015), others have used non–income-based measure (Klasen, 2010; McKinley, 2010). This has meant that policy prescriptions have often been contentious.====The inclusive growth literature suggests that informality is a key determinant of inclusive growth (see Heintz, 2012; Oosthuizen et al., 2016). In a 2008 report by the Commission on Growth and Development inclusive growth constitutes equality of opportunities, protection in the market, employment transitions, and equity, which are essential for achieving a successful growth trajectory (see Ianchovichina & Lundstrom, 2009). Consequently, productive employment has become a key feature for measuring inclusive growth (Ianchovichina & Lundstrom, 2009; McKinley, 2010; World Bank, 2020b). Hence, a fundamental approach advanced in the inclusive growth literature to measure informality is the level of informal employment (see Heintz, 2012; La Porta & Shleifer, 2014; Oosthuizen et al., 2016). This measure is important because a large proportion of the labour force is in the informal sector (ILO, 2016; IMF, 2020a; Kanbur, 2009; World Bank, 2020a). Further, in SSA, most youths are either vulnerably employed or informally employed in the formal sector (AfDB, 2016; Heintz, 2012; ILO, 2017). For SSA, an estimated 74.1% of the labour force is in vulnerable employment (see AfDB, 2016; ILO, 2017; World Bank, 2020b). Most informal jobs are currently characterised by a lack of protection, non-payment of wages, and a lack of social benefits; this tends to inhibit productivity (see Todaro & Smith, 2015; Ulyssea, 2010). Consequently, most governments have implemented policies aimed at improving employment conditions in the informal sector (see Brock, 2015; La Porta & Shleifer, 2014; Saraçoğlu, 2020).====Few studies have examined the impact of informality on inclusive growth. As argued by Heintz (2012), failure to account adequately for informality, which captures jobs that lack social protection and regulatory oversight, may bias the impact of informality on inclusive growth (see also Chen et al., 2002; Oosthuizen et al., 2016; Traoré & Ouedraogo, 2020; Tumen, 2016). For Oosthuizen et al. (2016) and Oviedo (2009), the prevailing economic condition in a country may influence the impact of informality on inclusive growth. One economic condition highlighted in the literature as influencing informality is financial inclusion of those in the labour force (Aryeetey, 2015; Brock & German-Soto, 2017; Field, 2012; Golub & Hayat, 2015; ILO, 2016, 2017; La Porta & Shleifer, 2014). Although several studies (see Bittencourt et al., 2019; Ibrahim & Alagidede, 2018; Kim, 2016; Nam et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2019; Swamy, 2014) have identified financial inclusion as a vital source of development and inclusiveness, financial intermediaries tend to limit funding to informal workers as a result of increased risk and cost of financing (IMF, 2020a, 2020b; Kim, 2016; Nguyen et al., 2019). For Canelas (2015) and Gibson and Kelley (1994), the impact of financial inclusion on the informality–inclusive growth nexus remains inconclusive (see also Allen et al., 2014; Kim, 2016; Sahay et al., 2015; Soedarmono et al., 2017).====This paper aims to extend the literature by empirically investigating the linkage between informality and inclusive growth, and exploring the moderating role of financial inclusion in the informality–inclusive growth nexus. This paper makes three major contributions. First, using a comprehensive and recent dataset spanning the period 1990–2018, we provide new empirical evidence that the impact of informality on inclusive growth varies according to the measure of inclusiveness and informality. Second, our results show that financial inclusion exhibits an inverted-U-shaped relationship with inclusive growth; that is, we find that an increase in financial inclusion increases inclusive growth up to a threshold and thereafter declines. Third, the results show that the moderating role of financial inclusion in the informality–inclusive growth nexus is mixed, and depends on the level of financial inclusion, and measures of informality and inclusive growth. Overall, our results are robust to alternative model specifications.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology and data. Section 3 reports and discusses the empirical results. Sections 4 concludes and draws some policy implications of the empirical findings.",The impact of informality on inclusive growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: Does financial inclusion matter?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016189382100051X,19 May 2021,2021,Research Article,126.0

The integration of Palestinian and Israeli labor markets is unique, as it differs from international ","The four fundamental economic freedoms are the free movement of goods, services, labor and capital (Stephenson and Hufbauer, 2010). Over the last five decades, tariffs have been sharply reduced and several trade agreements have been signed to facilitate the free movement of goods (Orefice, 2017). Similarly, the number of bilateral investment treaties and trade agreements is growing at a rapid pace to ease capital and services movement (Stephenson and Hufbauer, 2010). In contrast to the other three economic freedoms, free movement of labor has been most restricted internationally. One of the reasons for the reluctance of countries to allow for international labor mobility is the political sensitivities associated with the risk of permanent settlement of immigrants, fears for cultural identity, problems of assimilation and risks of replacement of domestic labor in the market (Winters et al., 2003).====From the perspective of the sending countries, remittances are an important aspect of labor mobility. Remittances refer to transfers by migrant workers who are employed in a foreign economy in which they are residents. By remitting part of their incomes, workers contribute to welfare improvements of their families back home. While remittances associated with labor mobility may improve household welfare, the sending economies may see their Gross National Product (GDP) decline due to the departure of part of their labor force (Stephenson and Hufbauer, 2010). Often, the remittances are large and can offset the GDP losses.====In this paper, we distinguish between labor migration and temporary labor movement. Both are relevant in the context of trade, especially trade in services, as most services need to be provided at the place of consumption. However, in contrast to international labor migration, the temporary movement of workers poses less cultural or integration challenges. With the temporary movement of labor, problems associated with the permanent settlement of unskilled labor and drains on the public purse are not relevant (Winters et al., 2003). In this paper, labor mobility is understood as the movement of workers to carry out employment in another country for a limited time period.====The temporary movement of labor is generally subject to considerable restrictions. Restrictions mostly target the low and semi-skilled workers, through quantitative regulations (e.g. quotas of workers), rules for obtaining work permits, and inefficiencies linked to the processing of work permits (Cattaneo et al., 2010). While temporary labor mobility is politically sensitive, it can generate economic and welfare gains that benefit both high-income (labor-receiving) and low-income (labor-sending) countries (Winters et al., 2003). The gains could be particularly high for developing countries that are labor abundant. Liberalizing labor mobility, and especially the temporary access of low-skilled labor to high-income markets for providing services, would allow such developing countries to make use of their comparative advantage.====A substantial body of literature on labor mobility between low-income and high-income countries has focused on remittances (Di Giovanni et al., 2015, Stephenson and Hufbauer, 2010, Egger et al., 2012) and the threat to domestic labor (Winters et al., 2003). We take a different perspective, in which migrant workers from a low-income region are employed in a high-income region, in which they are not residents and where they hardly compete with the domestic labor. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economy-wide effects of labor mobility between the West Bank and Israel. The choice of the Palestinian====-Israeli labor market relations reflects three considerations. First, the West Bank labor markets are an example of dual markets with employment opportunities in both domestic and Israeli markets. The proximity between the two economies allows labor to commute on a quasi-daily basis. Hence, most of the income earned in the receiving economy (Israel) is repatriated in the sending economy (West Bank), since there is no shift in residence. Second, Palestinian access to the Israeli labor market is administered. This is similar to other examples where temporary labor mobility is permitted under license, e.g., temporary workers schemes for South Asian employment in the construction sector in the Gulf States (Fargues, 2011) and seasonal agricultural workers schemes in Germany and the United Kingdom for Central and Eastern Europeans (Augère-Granier, 2021). Accordingly, Palestinian labor hardly compete with domestic Israeli labor, as work permits target sectors, where the domestic supply falls short of demand. In this respect, the study contributes to an enhanced understanding of the economic implications for low-income economies when high-income economies temporarily attract labor into low-skill employment. Third, the effects of Israeli labor policies on the Palestinian economy are an intensively debated topic in policymaking and in civil society. Volatility of Israel’s policies has marked consequences for labor markets in the West Bank.==== As such the study contributes to this debate, using a new and comprehensive database for the West Bank.====This paper is organized as follows: section two provides a discussion on the Palestinian-Israeli labor markets and policies.

However, partly due to the damages associated with the pandemic and the ensuing euphoria over vaccines’ arrival, some of the challenges are mostly being ignored or are not recognized. This paper identifies some pitfalls and drawbacks in vaccine delivery. We argue that the somewhat unique tension between the speed of vaccine delivery and its scale can create opportunities for corrupt behavior that are often at odds with effective means to check abuse. While data on instances of abuse will emerge over time, it is useful to point out different avenues of abuse so that some preventive government actions can be undertaken. Specifically, we argue that the potential for out of turn delivery of vaccines and the stockpiling by unauthorized agents creates incentives for ====, with the public or bureaucrats initiating corrupt transactions. An understanding of the potential avenues for corruption should guide the formulation of appropriate corruption-control policies and similar challenges that will be faced by policy makers in addressing future pandemics.","The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic saw a glimmer of hope in early 2021 with the arrival and testing efficacy of a number of vaccines.==== The public and policymakers around the world have sighed a collective relief, although the delivery and dissemination of the vaccines to meet global demand that already stands at 10 billion doses remains a formidable exercise.==== Recognizing the logistical challenges, numerous efforts are being undertaken to ensure timely delivery of vaccines, prioritize vaccinations across population groups, and minimize any wastage.====). More specifically, in the development of new drugs, firms could bribe the regulator (e.g., the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) in the United States) to expedite the approval process and/or alter the allocation of a drug between prescription-only or over-the-counter sale classifications.====Despite the relatively recent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a body of formal research is emerging examining various (economic and other) aspects, although some data are either unavailable or coming out with a lag (see ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ====); ====). The aspects related to corruption in the vaccine rollout process have not yet been formally examined. Broadly speaking, this research ties to the corruption of science (====; ====).====While one could defer to the findings of that line of investigation in studying the rollout of the coronavirus vaccines, there are some unique aspects related to vaccine dissemination that warrant renewed and somewhat special attention. In particular, there is another layer of government intervention related to vaccine availability in addition to the testing phase; here, the government is also directly or indirectly involved in the delivery phase of the vaccine. Since the testing and delivery arms of the government are mostly separate, there are a number of potential avenues for corruption that we will discuss below.====Even at a cursory glance at the global vaccination landscape, evidence for systemic vulnerabilities to corruption abounds and the implications of corruption are dire.==== The global rollout of approved vaccines proved to be—at least in the initial stages—much slower than had been promised by central authorities.==== Different groups have been lobbying to get preferential administration of the vaccine,==== and there are reports of related scams emerging.==== These abuses need to be checked not just for fairness and equality, but any abuse, given the nature of the disease, can amount to unnecessary loss of life. Vaccine nationalism, arguably a form of international corruption, has also created vastly different COVID-19 realities in different parts of the world. While Western nations race towards fully inoculating their populations by the end of summer or fall 2021, less wealthy nations are left struggling to source vaccines for even their most vulnerable. For example, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the continent aims to vaccinate about 35% of its population by the end of 2021 and another 25% in 2022; at such a pace, the African continent would not reach herd immunity until 2023 or later (====). Moreover, corruption in the delivery and distribution of vaccines would compound existing misinformation and distrust of vaccine safety and efficacy; without faith in the process, the public may be less likely to comply with public health guidelines and therefore less likely to collectively achieve herd immunity. Consequently, the potency of vaccines in containing the COVID-19 pandemic is as tied to their physical formulation as it is to the public’s faith in the process through which they were developed, distributed, and administered, and safeguarding against abuses during vaccine rollout is a critical public health matter.====Each stage also introduces its own unique challenges and considerations, the tradeoffs of which are of direct relevance to the vaccine rollout. Regarding the balance between scale and speed, the invention and development stages of the vaccines policymakers are most concerned with speed (e.g., speed development and testing a vaccine), while the diffusion stage is where the tension between scale and speed comes into play, with potentially some unique implications for corrupt behavior.====In certain innovations, the government intervenes before the innovation is marketed to the public (e.g. before the diffusion stage) to ensure safety and reliability (see ====).==== Examples include the testing of automobiles for their crashworthiness, testing of drugs for their side effects, etc. In one sense, the regulatory approval stage associated with coronavirus vaccines is similar to the one faced by other drugs to ensure adverse side effects are accounted for, the public informed accordingly, and whether the drug/vaccine is to be available only through a doctor’s prescription. However, with worldwide deaths attributed to COVID-19 standing at more than three million and new daily cases continuing to spike upward at the time of this writing (====), there is an unprecedented urgency to develop and disseminate suitable vaccines to check the spread of the disease in as timely a manner as possible (see ====).==== While some nations like Israel have been successful in vaccinating a substantial proportion of their population, most developing nations face challenges in procuring and administering vaccines. The challenge is further complicated as the virus mutates into new strains, calling into question whether or not vaccines originally developed to combat the disease are still effective,==== and questions about potentially adverse side effects of taking vaccines remain.==== As a result, the vaccine rollout faces another layer of regulatory oversight in ensuring smooth delivery, minimal wastage, and orderly delivery of the vaccine. This additional layer of government intervention, one that is likely to be performed by different government agencies than the ones that granted regulatory approval for dispensation, warrants that the coronavirus vaccine dissemination process be analyzed somewhat differently than that for other drugs.====The goal of this paper is to point out possible corruption opportunities that can occur at the various stages of the vaccine development and dissemination stages. These should help policymakers design some proactive stances that could mitigate such corrupt occurrences. Furthermore, experts predict more frequent and deadlier pandemics going forward. A better understanding today of potential corruption “pressure points” of future campaigns to fight these threats should also prove useful (see ====).

Thus, this study examines EPU's impact on the bank's earnings opacity of the Chinese ==== ====, using the two-step system GMM estimator and the time covering 2011–2018. Our finding shows a negative and statistically significant relationship between EPU and bank earnings opacity, implying that the Chinese ==== sector decreases earnings opacity in times of high EPU to earn trust and show good banks’ financial image. Moreover, our finding reveals that the effect of EPU on earnings opacity relies on the banks’ financial strength. This study recommends that a policy to reduce earnings opacity should be in place and also the supervisory capability and financial regulation should be strengthened. Moreover, the regulators should be more vigilant while making economic policies during high economic uncertainties.","Banks are integral parts of economic growth. Good banking policies positively contribute to the country's economy and, on contrary weak banking policies can be detrimental to the economy. In an opaque business such as banks, policy risks are higher during uncertain times. In other words, during high economic uncertainty, the effect of economic policy shock is less predictable in the banking sector; therefore, policy-making is more prone to error. In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, policymakers worldwide promoted new rules and institutions to reduce earnings opacity of the financial system (Granja, 2018). Reducing bank earnings opacity is the first step to make the policy-making process more transparent. Furthermore, disclosure helps to design good policy, identify growing risks, and take action that investors and customers worldwide are demanding.====Uncertainty in economic policy reflects the possibility that economic policy will vary in the next period and impact macro and micro-level activities (Jiang, Pittman, & Saffar, 2017). China has implemented several economic policy reforms subject to different uncertainty shocks (Huang & Luk, 2020). For instance, the stimulus package introduced in response to the global recession of 2008 widen the capital misallocation in the Chinese economy and leads to high policy uncertainty (Johansson & Feng, 2016). Moreover, the introduction of RMB's market-based pricing mechanism in 2015 through currency devaluation proved unsuccessful. Likewise, the unsuccessful launch of the “circuit-breaker” mechanism in 2016 on Chinese stock markets is another failed policy. Furthermore, the US-China tit-for-tat trade war, which started in 2018, knocked down China's GDP growth rate. Besides, Covid-19 is creating economic uncertainty in China and the rest of the world and changing countries’ policy framework (Kumar, Priya, & Srivastava, 2020; Samadi, Owjimehr, & Halafi, 2020). Unfortunately, the policy response to manage the financial and economic shocks caused by COVID-19 did not provide the intended goal (Rizwan, Ahmad, & Ashraf, 2020). Generally, the government's economic policies frequently confuse market participants and provoke governments to take a stance against the original purpose of a policy that leads to uncertainty shock (Chi & Li, 2017).====Earnings opacity is the intrinsic difficulties that prevent outsiders (investors) from perceiving and assessing banks’ activities and resources (Dewally and Shao, 2013, Kozubovska, 2017, Petrella and Resti, 2013). In other words, since banks are more opaque than non-banking industry, opacity in earnings can cause uncertainty for investors regarding the values of banks, weaken market discipline, and allow banks to suppress adverse information (Bushman, 2016). Also, managers manipulate the bank's financial statements to keep away from the regulatory requirements (Andreou, Cooper, Louca, & Philip, 2017). Furthermore, the Basel III banking regulatory reform places great importance on transparency and disclosure in the worldwide banking industry (Fosu, Danso, Agyei-Boapeah, Ntim, & Murinde, 2018).====Even though the Basel agreement was fully implemented in the Chinese banking sector, the importance of transparency practice is rarely discussed (Bashir, Yu, Hussain, Wang, & Ali, 2017). As banks are prone to uncertainty and risk-averse, the actions of commercial banks can be affected by EPU (Chi & Li, 2017). For instance, EPU negatively affects credit growth (Bordo, Duca, & Koch, 2016; Gozgor, Demir, Belas, & Yesilyurt, 2019), raises the prices of banks’ loans (Nadeem & Shen, 2019) and results in lower bank valuations (He & Niu, 2018). As per our knowledge, no previous empirical studies have assessed the relationship between earnings opacity and EPU in the Chinese banking industry. Therefore, this study aims to examine the impact of EPU on China's banking sector's earnings opacity.====Our study contributes to the existing studies in the following ways. First, prior studies on EPU focus primarily on developed economies, particularly the US, and empirical studies in emerging economies are still scarce. The impact of the EPU depends on the stock market size, economic strength, and country (Christou, Cunado, Gupta, & Hassapis, 2017). As an emerging economy, the developed nation's finding may not apply to China because China's political and economic system is different from developed nations. Furthermore, unlike the developed nations, the Chinese government participation in the financial institution is pervasive. Thus, this study adds to the literature on banking and EPU in emerging economies. This study also brings policy implications for the Chinese banking industry and lessons for the banking sector concerning the EPU and earnings opacity. Second, emerging countries’ banking structures are more vulnerable to uncertainty changes (Nguyen, Le, & Su, 2020). Thus, examining the impact of EPU on the banking sector of the emerging country is worthwhile. Third, in this study, besides the index developed by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016), we used alternative EPU measures developed by Davis, Liu, and Sheng (2019). The alternative EPU index used two leading mainland newspapers (Renmin Daily and Guangming Daily). These newspapers are Chinese government mouthpieces and may thus reflect mainland China policymakers’ uncertainty. Mainland newspapers have a fair proxy for the EPU in China (Davis et al., 2019). Fourth, our research on the impact of EPU on bank earnings opacity would benefit policymakers and regulators. Prior research seldom explores earnings opacity stemming from policy uncertainty, including its relevance to Chinese banking industry transparency. Finally, to control endogeneity concerns, this study applied the Instrumental Variables (IV) method. Our finding signifies that an increase in EPU decreases bank earnings opacity, and this negative relationship is more evident in strong commercial banks. Besides, our result is almost the same as our baseline result when we use alternative EPU measures and alternative sample construction.",Does economic policy uncertainty affect bank earnings opacity?

RCGE models can provide comprehensive information, which make them more desirable analytical models for many researchers. Yet, RCGE models have not yet become a “go-to” for ==== practitioners when they are developing regional public policies. This paper reviews the current state of regional CGE models, describes their features, contributions and limitations and surveys some applications of the main three classes of RCGE models: region-specific, bottom-up, and top-down models. This paper concludes that the applications of RCGE are quite variable and flexible, with a new and more complex type of application to be developed with the advancement of computation economics. The paper offers recommendations on the micro, meso and macro conditions that are necessary to increase policy practitioners’ utilization of RCGE models.","Standard Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are commonly developed at the country level. CGE are very popular class of economic models that are used for analyzing a wide range of polices such as international trade, fiscal reforms, and environmental regulations (de Melo, 1988). The wide interest in using CGE modeling approach to analyze wide range of policies can be explained by its five features: (i) it captures the direct and indirect impacts associated with shocks of implementation of a policy reform; (ii) it is theoretically consistent: CGE models are based on the economic theory and have a microeconomic foundation, whereby the production and demand functions for all agents in the economy are explicitly calculated and taken into account, thus ensuring that the analysis is based on a correct theoretical understanding of how economies work; (iii) CGE models were built on an equilibrium system where income and expenditures have to match, therefore any shock (e.g., trade policy changes) can be quantitatively measured; (iv) it can measure changes in aggregate sectorial welfare, which is particularly important when policymakers are concerned about understanding the impact of a policy on a specific sector. As a result, this framework can help to answer questions such as “who are the winners and losers?” resulting from changes in a policy; and (v) CGE models are not restricted to perfect competition markets; imperfect or other market structure can be factored into the analysis (Piermartini and Teh, 2005, Borges, 1986, Kehoe and Kehoe, 1994).====The standard CGE model starts by assuming that the economy is in equilibrium for the selected year. This is labelled as the benchmark equilibrium of the economy and is used to calibrate the model. Once that is accomplished, the effects of any policy change (called a counterfactual equilibrium) are compared to this equilibrium. The model is then used to simulate the policy change by altering the relevant parameters, and calculating the new equilibrium (Petersen, 1997). Once the data set is selected, an appropriate functional form must be used to reflect the nature of demand and supply in an economy. For instance, the households are represented by equations that depict its source of income and demand for goods, while each industry is represented by equations modeling its supply and input demands. Then, the equilibrium is determined by matching supply and demand with inputs and outputs (Rodriguez, 2007). The functional forms must be consistent with economic theory, analytically tractable and congruent with how the researcher introduces elasticities into the model. This explains why many researchers often use general functional forms, such as Cobb-Douglas (C-D) and Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES), where the key parameters values, such as income and price elasticities, can be accurately incorporated while allowing for tractability. The results can then be used for policy appraisal by comparing the benchmark to counterfactual equilibrium (Shoven & Whalley, 1984; Bohringer, Rutherford, & Wiegard, 2003).",Regional Computable General Equilibrium models: A review,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821000442,28 April 2021,2021,Research Article,132.0

The study concludes with a list of policy lessons as the country seeks to make further changes to its GST. While there is a significant literature on harmonization of indirect taxes across countries that belong to a single economic grouping such as the EU, there is no such literature between regions within a large heterogeneous country. The present study on tax harmonization between the states in India attempts to fill this gap.","The introduction of the GST in India in 2017 attracted considerable national and international interest in academic and policy circles. While not the first country to introduce the GST, never before has any country of India's size and diversity implemented such a large nationwide role of a system of indirect taxation that is of relatively recent vintage.====The principal motivation of this exercise is to examine the GST rates in India by comparing them with counterfactuals. These counterfactuals are based on preference based optimal commodity tax rates estimated by taking into account regional diversity in prices and spending. Two hypotheses have been examined in this context: (i) whether uniform tax rate for a commodity is applicable across states and (ii) whether uniform tax rates are applicable across commodities and states. Both comparisons endorse a picture of heterogeneity in the indirect tax settings.====While the exercise is policy driven, the study also makes methodological contributions by (a) showing how the standard Ramsey-Samuelson-Diamond-Mirrlees analytical framework can be used as the basis for the empirical exercise, thus, providing a bridge between the two, and (b) proposing a method to fill gaps in the data if the available information does not meet the requirements. Point (b) is particularly important since a policy focussed analysis is only as useful as it is allowed to be, by the available information. The procedure to circumvent the data hurdle in providing evidence on variation in the ‘optimal commodity tax rates’ in India will be of use in future investigations as they grapple with the handicap of the missing regional price information until the required data are available. The proposed procedure is also useful in other countries with heterogeneous preferences, as the issue of subnational tax rates within an overall centralised set up becomes an issue that will attract increasing attention. Examples are Federal countries like Brazil, Indonesia (among emerging economies) and Canada, USA (among developed market economies). While there is now increasing evidence on ‘subnational PPPs’, i.e. the same unit of currency having different purchasing power in different regions in the country, there is hardly any evidence on ‘subnational optimal commodity tax rates’. The two are interlinked since heterogeneity of preferences within the country is the basis for both: a spatial variation in cost of living indices and a spatial variation in optimal tax rates. The absence of regional price data poses a hurdle for both. Underlining this link is the result in the ‘optimal tax literature’ that the optimal commodity taxes (i.e. tax design) and tax reforms are crucially dependent on prices and preferences. Hence, if there is large spatial variation in prices within the country, it translates to a spatial variation in the optimal tax rates as this study confirms. Therefore, one requires detailed prices at subnational level that is rarely available. The proposed procedure avoids this and the empirical evidence presented later on both spatial prices (i.e. subnational PPPs) and subnational tax rates confirms its double-edged usefulness.====In course of comparing the prevailing and counterfactual (i.e. optimal) commodity tax rates incorporating regional diversity in prices and preferences, we also examine the redistributive impact on the welfare levels of the individuals. The indirect tax system has a strong redistributive role that our evidence on tax progressivity sheds some light on. This has acquired importance in the Indian context in view of the evidence of Chancel and Piketty (2019) that inequality in India has been increasing sharply and, as Kulkarni and Gaiha (2021) pointed out recently, this has implications for poverty as well. Though we do not address the further question of how much redistribution the set of commodity tax rates actually achieves, the present study sets up the basis for that further investigation. To underline the policy importance of the principal question posed above on the progressivity, or otherwise, of the various commodity tax rates in India, we should point out that the indirect system is the principal fiscal redistributive mechanism in India because of its wide reach. Through a policy of large price subsidy (i.e. negative commodity tax) on items of necessity that are consumed mainly by the poorer households balanced by large tax on luxury items consumed primarily by the rich to ensure revenue neutrality in the optimal tax framework, indirect taxes can play a strong redistributive role. In contrast, direct taxes have a limited reach - for example, in the assessment year, 2018–19, there were only 80 million income tax assesees (out of an employed adult population of 848 million). While the bottom half does not pay income taxes, the most affluent households are not in the income tax net either since they rely on non-income sources of earnings. Unlike indirect taxes, the direct tax net is therefore largely restricted to the middle-income households providing it with limited scope for redistribution.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. To provide a background for this study, a short history of the GST in India is presented in Section 2. The optimal commodity tax framework is presented in Section 3. This section also contains the description of the tax progressivity measures used in this study. Section 4 describes the data including the proposed methodology for generating the spatial prices required to estimate the optimal tax rates for comparison across states.

It will take several years of persistent investment efforts to restore the pre-pandemic level of capacity and put global output back to potential. By using a production function based on the incremental capital-output ratio, we estimate the loss of production capacity for the global economy and for the two main world locomotives, the U.S. and China. To do this, we estimate the production capacity implied in our current recession baseline and the capacity that would have existed in the absence of the pandemic (precrisis scenario). The difference between the two estimates is defined as the loss of capacity generated by the pandemic. The results also allow us to extract some policy implications in terms of mitigation measures and investment requirements.","Economic contractions are always accompanied by a degree of lethality in terms of businesses, infrastructure and employment. The ==== of businesses not only reduces physical investment but also restrains investment in human resources, thus affecting multifactor productivity. If the stock of capital falls, then production capacity diminishes and leaves the economy with less potential to grow. Restoring the level of capital resources takes time after a crisis, and so does restoring the economy’s capacity.====The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the world economy severely. Paralysis in a number of activities took a heavy toll on individual economies during the first half of the year. Particularly affected were economies with weak fundamentals, close ties with China and the U.S., and those with less-prepared health systems. The consensus forecast shows that the global economic contraction will be deeper than that in 2008–2009, and the data already available confirm the downward trend.====Our current baseline==== captures the global downturn because of the availability of first-quarter GDP figures for several countries. Based on the severity of the recession, it is evident that the global economy will suffer a reduction in production capacity given the destruction of investments in physical and human capital. Given the loss of capital generated by the crisis, one way to compute the potential loss of production capacity is by estimating a production function based on the change in capital stock. Using the production function, we compute the production capacity implied in our central scenario that includes the most probable recession outcome—the June baseline. We also extract the production capacity that would have existed in the absence of the virus crisis—which was our March baseline. The comparison of these will give us an estimate of the loss of capacity generated by the crisis.

In an important “jobs” speech in Monessen, Pennsylvania, on June 28, 2016, he foreshadowed his policies. “If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,” he said.====On that, Trump kept his word. His administration imposed tariffs on imports from China under each of the legal authorities mentioned in that speech. However, Trump did not follow through with other policies he promised to implement, including some involving the World Trade Organization (WTO) outlined in that same June 28 speech. He also said, for example, “I am going to instruct the US Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China’s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.” His administration did not bring any meaningful WTO disputes against China, nor did it make any policy progress addressing China’s subsidies, even with the US-China Phase One agreement, signed to much fanfare in January 2020.====The Trump presidency changed US trade policy toward China. Measuring that change and identifying its causes and effects will keep researchers busy for years. Doing so will also require carefully distinguishing between the Trump administration’s rhetoric and its policy actions. At the same time, making sense of the Chinese government’s policy response will prove equally challenging, as its actions were often less transparent and more difficult to measure, albeit for different reasons.====This paper has two main purposes. The first is to clarify how the Trump administration period resulted in new tariffs suddenly covering more than half of bilateral trade. It uses, and makes publicly available, detailed data on the timing and size of trade policy actions (tariffs imposed and trade covered) throughout the trade war, as well as the trade outcomes arising under the first year of the Phase One agreement. The second is to characterize other trade policy changes that occurred during the Trump period that have received less attention from researchers to date. Including these changes may be needed to provide a more complete and accurate political-economic assessment of what happened and why.====The paper thus makes four main contributions. First, after establishing the starting point, through a brief description of US–China trade relations before the Trump administration, the paper identifies the timing, definitions, and scale of products subject to the tariff changes affecting US–China trade from January 20, 2017 through January 20, 2021. On the US side, in addition to the Section 301 tariffs, it includes protection imposed via presidential discretion, including the US safeguard law (Section 201) and the US national security law (Section 232). These are the tariffs that most research has focused on when examining their impact on economic activity. By January 20, 2021, actions under these laws had raised the average US tariff on China to over 19 percent, up from 3 percent before the trade war.====On the Chinese side, the analysis begins with its trade war counter-tariffs. But the first complication to the Chinese story is its significant reductions in applied Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariffs undertaken during the trade war period. Indeed, while China’s retaliation to US actions led it to increase its average tariff on US exporters from 8 percent to more than 20 percent over the course of the trade war, China ==== the average duty facing imports from the rest of the world from 8 percent to 6 percent by the end of 2020.====Second, the paper introduces two additional channels through which US and Chinese tariffs imposed on each other changed during this period. These channels are more challenging to measure and have received less attention, despite their potential to affect many avenues of political-economic interest.====One is the temporary product exclusions each side periodically granted to the trade war tariffs imposed on the other. At some point between 2018 and 2020, for example, the United States excluded products covering an estimated 4 percent of its imports from China that it had hit with new tariffs. It refunded, or excluded from tariff application, about 9 percent of the $96 billion of estimated revenue collections for the Section 301 tariffs from 2018 through 2020. China, on the other hand, is estimated to have excluded roughly 16 percent of the US imports it had hit with counter-tariffs. Yet, even these exclusions do not include an important but opaque set of product-specific exemption opportunities the Chinese government created for Chinese firms starting in 2020, in order to perhaps facilitate their purchases under the Phase One agreement. The sliding nature and uncertainty of each country’s exclusions and exemptions, as well as their potential retroactivity, requires careful consideration of how to interpret them, as well as their implications for economic activity. (The US exclusions may even affect economic analysis, given that the US Census has revised key data series in light of their retroactivity).====Trade remedies are a second channel through which tariff barriers also changed over this period. Unlike the other policies, use of antidumping and countervailing duties was not new. (Before the trade war, for example, US antidumping covered nearly 8 percent of US imports from China.) US use of such tariffs largely continued on its pre-Trump trend between 2017 and 2021, climbing to cover an additional 2.5 percentage points of imports from China. China also adjusted its tariffs through trade remedies during this period, albeit to a lesser extent. But failure to consider these policy instruments in an analysis of the trade war may lead to mismeasured estimates of the impact of other tariffs on economic activity or mischaracterization of why the United States or China chose to impose trade war tariffs on some products but not others.====Third, the paper provides an initial assessment of the first full year of purchases that China made under the Phase One agreement. The deal was announced in December 2019, signed in January 2020, and implemented in February 2020. The headline of the agreement was a Chinese commitment to purchase an additional $200 billion of a subset of US goods and services split over 2020 and 2021. China fell more than 40 percent short of the 2020 targets for goods purchases, and a deeper look at a number of products helps explain why. It is not as simple as blaming the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.====Fourth, the paper identifies some additional policy actions the Trump administration implemented over 2017–21 that could also continue to affect US–China trade into the future. They include banning imports to address forced labor in Xinjiang; no longer considering Hong Kong an independent customs territory for purposes of US imports and exports; and imposing new export controls, including on semiconductors, equipment, and software.",The US–China trade war and Phase One agreement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821000363,22 April 2021,2021,Research Article,135.0

Sustained infrastructure and education spending can help counter headwinds to the long-term outlook. However, the fact that government borrowing rates are at extremely low levels does not imply that the very high debt, especially short-term borrowing, is a free lunch. Real borrowing rates are likely below long-term trend, and there is no guarantee that any future adverse shock can only lower ====. Massive underfunded old-age transfer and support programs are a form of hidden non-market “junior” debt.","The worldwide pandemic has already led a massive increase in government debt, on the order of 14% of GDP for advanced economies, 6% of GDP for emerging markets and 2% in developing economies.==== The out-sized response has been necessary given a short-term output collapse far deeper than the 2008 financial crisis. Disaster relief fiscal spending has helped cushion the immediate effects on the populace and will help to reduce long-term economic scarring. Going forward, sustained spending on infrastructure, health and education will be needed to counter long-term headwinds to growth post-pandemic.====However, with massive deficits on the one hand, and collapsing growth on the other, debt to GDP ratios throughout the world have soared. As 2020 ends, gross public debt is already averaging over 125% of GDP in advanced economies, 62 percent in emerging markets and 49% in low-income developing economies. And, of course, the crisis is far from over.====What, if any, are the limits? The short answer is that in a natural catastrophe of this magnitude, the standard textbook response is to the win the war, and then worry about paying for it afterwards. Whatever the costs of dealing with very high debt, including possibly reduced flexibility in responding to future shocks, they are likely significantly smaller than the immediate risks the governments are responding to, where markets permit. But that should not be taken to mean that very high and rising debt is a free lunch, and in particular it would be incautious to argue that countries ought to plan on remaining in wartime finance mode in perpetuity. Policies need to balance risk and return. This is particularly true for short-term borrowing given that global real interest rates were likely well below long-term historical trend at the end of 2020, even if the long-term trend exhibits a gentle decline on the order of magnitude found by Schmelzing (2020). A trend decline of 2.3 basis points per year cannot explain the more than 300 basis point drop in the inflation-adjusted 10-year US Treasury bill rate that has taken place from before 2008 financial crisis until the end of 2020.====Much of the basis for the view that debt is non-issue for advanced economies revolves around the observation that for most countries, the growth rate of the economy typically exceeds the interest rate on government debt (albeit this was certainly not in 2020).==== If a positive growth/interest differential can be counted on to hold indefinitely with high probability, then countries ought to be able to handle much larger debt/GDP ratios than the historical norm. As long as growth outstrips the interest rate on debt, then over time, debt to GDP levels will eventually stabilize or decline as long as the primary deficit to GDP ratio is capped at some level. If another crisis hits, so the logic goes, it does not matter because the borrowing rate will only go down and the government will be able to borrow even more.====We will argue that this view is pollyannish, even for advanced economies, first and foremost because historically, not all adverse shocks make interest rates go down. The fact this happened in 2008 and 2020 should necessarily be taken as evidence that shocks can only make rates go down in the future. Even if a global conventional war is unlikely, other adverse shocks that might lead to a sustained spike in government spending, for example climate and health shocks, have become much larger. Alternatively, it is possible that that strong Asia growth over the next couple decades pushes up global real rates, even as US and European growth stagnate. Second, recent research shows that growth interest differentials have been the norm over the past two centuries (e.g., Mauro & Zhou, 2021), but this has not always led to falling debt/GDP levels. Politicians have long learned how to spend more than the growth interest dividend, and negative r==== ====−==== ====g differentials do not appear to imply a significantly lower risk of crisis. Third, policies to that aim to overly leverage the growth interest differential, as are widely be discussed, can often lead to higher interest rates, lower growth, or both. Indeed, countries with very high debt levels appear to enjoy (on average) shorter spells where the growth interest differential is positive. Fourth, as Rogoff (2020) emphasizes, conventional measures of “senior” marketable public debt miss the larger body of “junior debt” embedded in old age pensions and medical care.==== As such, market measures of risk to interest rates may miss the effects of high debt on risks to pensions and other “junior” debt.====To be clear, advanced economies face a very different risk/reward calculus to higher debt levels than do most poorer countries. Over the next few years, the risks of default in emerging market and developing economies will likely remain very high even as the pandemic recedes. Emerging markets are facing all the same health problems as advanced economies, and many are having to do so in the face of much tighter fiscal constraints, on top of a global recession; many came into the pandemic already carry high public and private external debt loads. The risk of a wave of emerging market and developing economy defaults in the aftermath of the pandemic is a very real one, albeit not the focus here.

We construct a novel sectoral measure of retaliation using daily bilateral data on TTB responses in 1220 subsectors across a panel of 25 advanced and emerging economies over 1989–2015. We use this measure to present novel stylized facts and patterns suggesting that strategic considerations may be more important (in terms of intensity and frequency) than commonly understood from the existing literature, which has tended to ignore within-year responses. Our evidence indicates that retaliation actually often consists of responses across many sectors and indeed that same-sector retaliation is far from being the norm.","As tariffs have come down all over the world, demand for protection has increasingly been satisfied through recourse to other trade barriers. Notably, temporary trade barriers (TTBs), which take the form of anti-dumping (AD) duties, countervailing duties, and global or China-specific safeguards, are permitted by the WTO in order to protect a specific industry from foreign competition in exceptional circumstances.====TTBs have increasingly been used as reported in Fig. 1. The average number of new TTB investigations per year peaked in the period following China’s WTO accession. Advanced economies were initially large users of these measures but use by emerging economies has increased—Fig. A1 reports the total number of new investigations initiated per country; Fig. A2 reports the average number of new investigations per type.====While the WTO legitimizes these measures to counter unfair practices centered on particular sectors, a fear is that they may be used for strategic reasons. This concern has given rise to a literature assessing the use of TTBs for strategic motives. However, empirical evidence on the use of TTBs for strategic purposes is mixed. Blonigen and Bown (2003) use AD data for the US to test the impact of retaliation threats. Using data for 645 decisions by the US AD authority, they find that an industry is more likely to file an AD petition the greater the import penetration and the lower the exposure to retaliation. Prusa and Skeath (2002) find evidence to support both economic and strategic motives for AD filings. Using industry-level data, Feinberg and Reynolds (2006) find that the likelihood of a country filing a case is higher against countries that targeted it in the previous year. Moore and Zanardi (2011) show that retaliation variables help explain the probability of observing an AD petition except for developing countries that have become heavy users of AD. In contrast, Boffa and Olarreaga (2012) find no evidence of retaliatory motives driving protectionism during the GFC and show that a protectionist measure imposed by a trading partner reduces the probability of a measure imposed by the home country. Tabakis and Zanardi (2017) develop a dynamic game where two competing importers can impose AD measures on a third country, and document that AD echoing—different countries sequentially imposing AD measures on the same product and exporter—is common among users of AD.====We argue that a potential reason for this inconclusive evidence is the way the key explanatory variable that measures retaliation (the “retaliation variable”) is constructed. In the literature, typically, the measure consists of a dummy variable that takes the value of one in year ==== if country ==== filed a TTB against ==== prior to year ==== (e.g., Prusa & Skeath, 2005; Boffa & Olerreaga, 2012; Feinberg & Reynolds, 2006). A key problem with this approach is that retaliatory measures that take place within a year will not be captured, and nor will the intensity (the number of TTBs—TTB count) of retaliation. A second issue concerns the use of aggregate country-level data. TTBs are initiated at the product or industry level, so it stands to reason that an understanding of the factors affecting such decisions should rely on industry-level data. Moreover, in a country-level analysis it is impossible to control for all the macroeconomic factors affecting the decision of a country to impose a TTB and therefore approaches reliant on aggregate data are vulnerable to the criticism that impacts attributed to retaliation may instead reflect other unobserved macroeconomic shocks.====In this paper we make a first effort at addressing these issues. We start by reconsidering the definition to retaliatory TTBs. Our definition encompasses those actions (TTBs) taken by country ==== that are not too distant from TTBs taken by a trading partner ====, where not too distant is formalized by not more than ==== days, where ==== is the median response time (in days) between ====’s actions and those of all its trading partners. We apply this definition on an extensive sample of TTBs, recorded at daily frequency and covering 1220 subsectors across 25 advanced and emerging economies over 1989–2015—(the World Bank’s TTB Database; Bown, 2015). The high frequency of the data is key to capturing the TTB actions by countries ==== and ==== and use of sectoral data allows us to disentangle same-sector versus cross-sector retaliatory measures. In a formal empirical analysis, it also allows to control for macroeconomic shocks (using country-time fixed effects).====We present stylized facts from our new retaliation data, highlighting differences between advanced and emerging economies, and large and small economies. Our preliminary investigation provides suggestive evidence of the use of TTBs for strategic motives. At the same time, we find wide dispersion across countries in their recourse to TTBs for retaliatory purposes, with smaller and emerging market economies retaliating less than larger or more developed countries. Recourse to retaliatory TTBs has increased over time, peaking in the early 2000s and after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). We also show that retaliation typically consists of responses across many sectors and that same-sector retaliation is far from being the norm. This suggests that retaliation may be driven more by perceptions of unfair foreign policies than specific sectoral injuries. Finally, retaliation is more acute during periods of weak growth and high unemployment. Furceri, Ostry, Papageorgiou and Wibaux (2021, forthcoming) subjects this descriptive evidence to formal empirical tests and a complete set of robustness checks.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

A recent paper by Jones and Summers (2020) suggests that the rate of return from international spillovers from research and development (R&D) expenditures could be very large. R&D is often a driver of innovation and a focus area for industrial policies. This paper summarizes the recent literature on how innovation spillovers are thought to work through the global economy, particularly with respect to trade as a vector to transmission of those spillovers. The paper also looks at how with the rapid growth in digitization, with increased interest in digital technology as a facilitator to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, might change how governments and trade negotiators think about industrial and innovation policies in this digital age.====In the decade since the global financial crisis, government intervention in the economy has come back into fashion. Over 110 countries had articulated “new industrial policies,” “Industry 4.0,” or “digital transformation” plans by the end of 2019. The overriding theme of “new industrial policies” is to encourage technological upgrading, digitalized production and digital innovation (whether new in the world or new in the country). Countries at all levels of development have policies geared to support innovation and the digital transition. The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted certain aspects of the digital economy, as social distancing and lockdown measures imposed a massive use of digital solutions in a world temporarily characterized by the immobility of persons but mobility of goods. COVID policy responses have been also increasing previous trends to accelerate the transition of domestic resources towards digitization of goods and processes, and to focus on innovative solutions to regain domestic capabilities with the aims of reducing dependence on trade for emergency related goods and services.====The change in heart over industrial policy making has been the outcome of conceptual evolutions on the nature and content of policies over the past decades. As early as the 1990s, industrial policies embraced open economy requirements such as improving competitiveness through skills upgrading, acquisition of technological capacity, reduction of business and trade costs, infrastructure development, as important medium-term objectives. With this background, open trade and investment policies were regarded as essential in meeting these objectives, notably through global value chain integration. While governments also introduced strong horizontal, or cross-sectoral, objectives aimed at providing the infrastructure for economic growth, the horizontal focus did not completely displace sectoral policies, which remained a prominent feature of industrial policies. By the turn of the millennium, the concept of “industrial” policies extended beyond the manufacturing sector, and evolved towards a model of greater strategic collaboration between the private sector and governments, characterized by the relatively large presence of public-private partnerships and programmes to boost research and development (R&D).====In parallel, authors such as Romer (1990); Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Coe and Helpman (1995), for example, had emphasized the key role of innovation and related domestic and international spill-overs in driving growth in ""new growth"" theories. Aghion, Harris, Howitt, and Vickers (2001) further explained the two opposite effects of increased competition on innovation and growth: first, an escape competition effect whereby more intense competition stimulates innovation (to escape competitors), and second, a Schumpeterian effect whereby more intense competition reduces innovation rents and thereby discourages innovation. Subsequent work by Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Griffith, and Howitt (2005), showed that if starting at a low level of competition the “escape competition effect” dominates, whereas if starting at a high level of competition the Schumpeterian effect dominates.",Trade and innovation policies: Coexistence and spillovers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821000375,21 April 2021,2021,Research Article,140.0

Commitment is especially difficult in a contestable democracy with disputed values, and in a world of deep uncertainty. Indeed, as the previous discussion highlighted, in the absence of a complete set of markets and contracts, it is almost inevitable that some plans will not be fulfilled—and some agreements broken. The same applies to government. It may be impossible in some states of nature for governments to fulfill commitments that they make (e.g. that the exchange rate be maintained at a given level). The recognition that this is so undermines the credibility of commitment in the first place; and when the seeming commitment is broken, the credibility of the government making the commitment is further undermined. The pandemic has highlighted these issues: commitments of governments not to run deficits beyond certain levels have been broken by those governments that could do so.====The pandemic has also highlighted the ==== in society, with people at the bottom of the income ladder much more adversely affected than those at the top, both by the disease and its economic aftermath.====I highlight the implication of these new understandings for future policy in Section ====, while Section ",Lessons from COVID-19 and Trump for Theory and Policy (Paper),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821000314,18 April 2021,2021,Research Article,143.0

This paper investigates what has happened to the ,"From a historical perspective, the sovereign bond market of the countries of the European Monetary Union (EMU) has been characterized by two different periods. The first period involves the years after the adoption of the single currency (1999), where a rapid convergence of the interest rates within the euro-area is observed for most countries. This outcome has been considered a natural consequence of the adoption of the Euro as, on the one hand, it prevented devaluation risks at single-country level and, on the other hand, it benefited from the direct control of inflation and price stability assigned to the European Central Bank (ECB). As a consequence, since the beginning of the EMU and until the first half of 2008, sovereign bond yields have not changed significantly, with an average bond spread over the German bund close to zero. Frömmel and Kruse (2015), for example, give support to the convergence hypothesis for countries highly involved in the European integration policies (Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Italy) in the period from August 1983 to August 2007.====The beginning of the second period, to some extent, can be dated back to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Indeed, from mid-2010 onwards, a non-negligible divergence of the yields started to emerge, with debt markets experiencing a severe stress in Greece and in other financially vulnerable euro-area countries, in particular in Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus, Spain and Italy, which has been only partially compensated by policy tools.====In this framework, the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic is playing the role of a ‘game changer’; while affecting the global economic activity since early 2020, it introduces new and unpredictable elements in the market of sovereign bonds. Indeed, even though the long-term socio-economic effects of Covid-19 outbreak cannot be known, significant economic slowdowns of national economies around the world are already observable (Fernandes, 2020). The Eurozone is not an exception, as the spread of the virus has required severe measures that may undermine the economic and financial stability at least of some member states. In order to face this symmetric shock and to avoid even harder consequences, the ECB has been massively involved in shielding national economies, especially those of the most indebted countries. In particular, on the evening of 18 March 2020, the ECB has decided to implement the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), ==== a new temporary asset purchase programme of public (and private) sector securities, with an initial endowment of 750 billion of euros, later increased to 1350 billion on 4 June 2020 (first reinforcement) and to 1850 billion on 10 December 2020 (second reinforcement), and thought to last until the coronavirus crisis will be over, in any case not before the end of March 2022.====The intervention of the ECB, among others objectives, is aimed at easening the tensions on the interest rates on the public debt that member states has to issue to face the economic crisis. To some extent, this programme would benefit more countries where the ratio between public debt and GDP was already at critical levels before the pandemic crisis. But the pandemic crisis, in its own, may harden the situation of those same countries notwithstanding the intervention of the ECB, as such a massive intervention will not last forever. In this respect, easening tensions may be a palliative; higher level of public debts that will emerge at the end of the pandemic crisis will almost certainly require the reverse to restrictive fiscal policies and will leave the most indebted countries with an increasing difficulty to issue public debt because of possibly increasing interest rates.====In order to understand whether the public policy is moving towards this scenario, the paper will address some fundamental policy questions raised by the intervention of the ECB. In particular, has the involvement of the ECB been effective until now? Has its impact been symmetric across European countries? Is there any signal that the most indebted countries may face increasing tensions and can we expect long-run differential responses of bond yields in different countries? In this context, it should be kept in mind that the ECB reacted promptly to the Covid-19 crisis, especially if we compare the latest monetary policy interventions with those implemented during the previous crisis (the financial crisis of 2008 and the sovereign debt crisis of 2010 and 2011); in the latter cases, the ECB reacted with an extremely cautious gradualism and acted with delay in relation to other central banks (Morelli & Seghezza, 2020).====The analysis performed in this paper considers the changes that have occurred in the government bond markets of selected Eurozone countries by comparing 2019 with 2020. At this regard, it is important to underline that the first six months of 2020 represents a crucial moment for two main reasons: on the one hand, they can be considered the “first wave” of the pandemic crisis which found most European countries largely unprepared; on the other hand, the main policy responses of the ECB, which delineate our core research question, are concentrated right in this period. In any case, the whole 2020 has been considered in a three-step procedure in order to take into account the subsequent developments and to strengthen the data resulting from the first six months. In this context, both the 10-year government bond market and the related Credit Default Swap (CDS) market have been considered, in order to investigate the presence of a different path of two strongly related markets before and after the crisis. In fact, the link between CDS and government bond markets is complex, and in times of crisis it can be made even more complex by dissimilar degrees of liquidity associated to government bonds of different countries, by market imperfections and by speculative movements. Yet, the evolution of the difference between the CDS premium and the bond yields might provide additional information on possible asymmetric consequences of the pandemic symmetric shock in the medium run, especially because of their different reaction to the information available in times of economic distress.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the issue. Section 3 shows the empirical methodology to estimate trend dynamics in the period that follows the spread of the disease and to assess the relationship between the sovereign debt market and the CDS market, testing for structural breaks at several points in time corresponding to different announcements from the ECB. Section 4 provides and discusses the main results. Section 5 concludes and provides some important policy implications driven by the results.",The asymmetric impact of the pandemic crisis on interest rates on public debt in the Eurozone,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821000223,10 April 2021,2021,Research Article,145.0
Martins Pedro S.,"Queen Mary University of London, UK,NovaSBE, Portugal","Received 12 January 2021, Revised 25 February 2021, Accepted 25 February 2021, Available online 24 March 2021, Version of Record 24 September 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpolmod.2021.03.004,Cited by (1),"In many countries, jobseekers are entitled to unemployment benefits (UBs) only if they have previously worked a minimum period of time. This institutional feature creates a sharp change in the disutility from unemployment at UB eligibility and may distort the duration of jobs. In this paper, we evaluate this eligibility effect using a regression discontinuity approach. Our evidence is based on longitudinal social security data from Portugal, where jobseekers are required to work a relatively long period to collect UBs. We find that monthly transitions from employment to unemployment increase by 10% as soon as the eligibility condition is met. This result is driven entirely by transitions to subsidised unemployment, which increase by 20%, as non-subsidised unemployment is not affected. The effects are even larger for the unemployed with high UB replacement ratios or those who meet the eligibility condition from multiple short employment spells. These transitions deserve greater attention from UB agencies and public employment services.","Unemployment benefits (UBs) are an important labour market institution, as they provide income insurance against negative employment shocks, support aggregate demand during downturns, and may improve the quality of new employment matches (Acemoglu & Shimer, 2000; Card, Chetty, & Weber, 2007; Chetty, 2008). However, UBs can also, in some cases, lead to moral hazard, erode human capital, and increase unemployment by delaying transitions back to employment (Lalive, Van Ours, & Zweimuller, 2006; Meyer, 1990). The latter negative effects can be particularly important when UBs are too generous and or not coupled with appropriate activation practices.====This paper examines an additional potential negative effect of UBs on the labour market: the duration of employment spells prior to unemployment. The effect arises from the minimum prior employment duration requirements for the unemployed to be entitled to UBs, as applicable in most countries. For instance, according to Venn (2012), in France, an unemployed person is only entitled to benefits if she worked four months over the previous 28 months. In Germany and Japan, the requirement is of at least 12 months of work. In the UK and the US (its seven largest states), the average requirement is of 26 or 27 weeks over the previous two years or four quarters, respectively.====Such potential provision of UBs, once the applicable eligibility conditions are met, can impact negatively on the duration of employment spells. In fact, a worker that just meets the employment duration threshold for UB eligibility will see her unemployment outside option improve dramatically, from zero to a potentially large value determined by the applicable replacement ratio. This abrupt change will potentially create an important additional moral hazard margin complementary to the far more researched effects on the job search of the unemployed. If empirically relevant, this mechanism has considerable policy relevance. For instance, UB agencies and or public employment services may find it useful to pay more attention to these cases, particularly if eligibility is also conditional on involuntary separations (dismissals or layoffs but not quits), as is the case in several countries.====Given that job matches are subject to positive duration dependence (due to some combination of human capital and selection effects), eligibility effects may diminish considerably or even disappear under more demanding UB requirements. In other words, when benefits are only available after long employment spells, the remaining matches at that stage are likely to be of high quality and therefore less sensitive to the UB incentive. On the other hand, if eligibility effects are still sizeable under long employment spells, their economic consequences may be more negative. Indeed, in this case, more productive employment matches, of greater potential maximum duration, will be terminated early because of the unintended incentives created by UBs. Another dimension concerns the incentives prompted by UB eligibility in terms of the creation and duration of bad matches from the worker's perspective. In other words, some jobseekers may be more inclined to accept some jobs so that they can later qualify for UBs.====From an empirical perspective, this potential shortened employment effect has been confirmed in a number of studies, although focused almost exclusively on the case of Canada (Baker & Rea, 1998; Christofides & McKenna, 1996; Green & Riddell, 1997; Green & Sargent, 1998).==== Identification in these studies is based on changes in minimum employment duration requirements across Canadian provinces in different periods between 1986 and 1990, in some cases focusing on adjustments in requirements presumably unanticipated by economic agents. Using survey data, the studies find significant increases in the employment hazard exactly when the eligibility requirement is met.====This paper contributes to this literature by adopting a novel approach, inspired on a regression discontinuity design, that can be both widely applicable and highly transparent. Instead of considering cross-sectional or time (reform-related) variation in eligibility conditions, we infer the impact of UB eligibility from the intrinsic discontinuity that such requirements entail. Indeed, as indicated above, employed workers with employment durations up to the applicable threshold are not entitled to UBs. This ensures a considerable contrast of otherwise similar workers around the eligibility threshold that can be used for the purpose of understanding the effect of interest. This approach is applicable in all countries where suitable data is available, which can help broaden the currently very limited international evidence on this issue.====Our findings are obtained from longitudinal, monthly administrative (social security) data for Portugal, covering the period 2005–2012. The case of Portugal is interesting not only because of its above average unemployment rates but also because, in contrast to Canada, it is characterised by restrictive UB eligibility. We find significant negative effects of eligibility upon employment durations. These results are consistent with the limited available evidence for Canada and a few other countries despite the institutional and methodological differences. The moral hazard dimension of our findings is highlighted by the fact that there is no substitution between UB and non-UB transitions at eligibility: our effects are driven exclusively by transitions to UBs, while transitions to non-subsidised unemployment are not affected at all by the eligibility condition.====Moreover, we exploit the richness of the data to investigate the robustness and heterogeneity of the main effects depending on the characteristics of the workers. In important results, we find that individuals with high replacement ratios and who meet their eligibility thresholds from multiple employment spells (i.e., that have job breaks over the qualifying period) exhibit much higher (subsidised) unemployment effects. The latter result is also an important robustness check to disentangle the direct effect from UB eligibility from cases in which the duration of the employment contract happens to coincide with the eligibility requirement. Overall, our findings have clear policy implications, namely that greater attention should be paid by public agencies to individuals that leave their jobs soon after they meet the UB eligibility requirements.====The structure of the remaining of the paper is as follows: The next section describes the unemployment benefit eligibility practices across different countries and then focuses on the case of Portugal. Sections 3 and 4 present the data set and its descriptive statistics, respectively, including graphical previews of the results. The main results and their robustness checks are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 discusses the results, in particular in terms of policy recommendations.",Working to get fired?

This approach often ignores differences in program costs and presumes the state appropriation will not react. Here tuition and subsidy structures are developed as rules in a welfare-maximization framework. Once fixed costs are accommodated, low-pay resident enrollments can be admitted at marginal cost, thereby achieving efficient enrollments. The models are applied to Penn State University, where it is shown that high tuition-high aid can approximate actual tuition policy, accommodate enrollments of low-income students, and increase total welfare.","There are significant differences in public higher education universities, which range from open-access, two-year programs dependent on public support, to selective “very high research” universities with tuition autonomy. To various degrees, public universities share prominent features: (i) there are two primary revenue sources (state appropriations and tuition revenues); (ii) appropriations subsidize resident access; (iii) a breakeven requirement limits university profitability; (iv) fixed costs are a high percentage of total cost; and (v) nonresidents pay more. The implications of these features are examined in tuition models that compare welfare rankings associated with adopting high tuition-high aid tuitions that charge more to those with high ability to pay, enabling reduced tuitions to students with low ability to pay. The models developed here include program cost differences, residency restrictions, and the endogeneity of tuitions and the state appropriation.====Okun (1975) terms: “Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff” as the focus of most policy discussions; see Moscarola et al. (2020) for a recent application to the tax system. Efficiency is the relationship between willingness to pay and marginal costs, while equity focuses on the fairness issue of Who should pay? In higher education, Turner (2018) contemplates “Whether a ‘high tuition-high aid’ strategy would be more equitable and efficient than a low-tuition strategy at state universities?” With tuition revenue replacing taxpayer support (College Board, 2019), emergent privatization schemes contain some efficiency incentives. Importantly, an opportunity arises to move beyond two-step tuitions charged residents and nonresidents, to consider cost differences across programs, and to support enhanced low-income resident (L-resident) access. The policy issue is how to do so more efficiently; Kim and Stange (2016) indicate for the Texas System this is a plausible outcome.====The tuition setting models compare the ==== “pay what you can afford” (PWYCA) approach with quasi-efficient tuitions.==== Using consumer surplus net of the appropriation as the measure of value, monetary gains to low-pay residents are compared to monetary losses of high-pay residents, nonresidents, and taxpayers. The evaluations also compare the tuition and appropriation structures to a prominent university budgeting outcome, with revenue and cost distinctions made among colleges. In a two-stage model, a legislature at stage one determines the appropriation based on tuitions set by the university at stage two.==== The appropriation can support specific programs, or it can be applied as a direct offset against fixed costs. The tuition and appropriation rules are evaluated analytically and compared empirically.====A version of PWYCA suggested by AAAS (2016) allocates the appropriation to high willingness to pay residents (H-residents) to align their subsidized tuitions with nonresident tuitions (N-residents). The policy intent is to use the resulting incremental revenue to subsidize low-income residents (L-residents). For the AAAS example of the University of Michigan, a claim is made that nearly $100 million of annual incremental revenue results, an increment of 8% of UM tuition revenue.====The problematic assumption of PWYCA is that additional tuition revenue will not be offset by a decline in state support. To address this issue, the rule for setting H-resident tuition is embedded into a welfare-maximizing model with the legislature establishing the uniform subsidy to maximize total welfare. Student welfare is measured by the monetary value students receive after paying subsidized tuitions (net consumers’ surplus); university welfare is net revenue; and total welfare is student welfare plus university net revenue minus the appropriation. A uniform tuition charged L-residents and the H-resident subsidy are endogenously determined. The PWYCA solution indicates that increases in net tuition revenue will be offset by a reduction in the appropriation: without a credible commitment from the legislature to maintain public support, the appropriation declines. The reason for this response is that the policy intent of PWYCA is thwarted by misalignment between the competing equity and efficiency objectives of the legislature and the university. Specifically, the university’s tuition rules intended to inefficiently promote fair outcomes for L-residents are inconsistent with the overall efficiency criteria set by the legislature; a similar outcome occurs in Fethke (2011).====Rather than imposing tuition rules de novo, quasi-efficient tuitions are determined that maximize student welfare given residency requirements, a binding breakeven constraint, and a given subsidy structure.==== In this case, university and legislative objectives are aligned. The resulting tuitions exceed marginal costs by just enough to cover fixed costs net of the appropriation, with higher tuitions charged in programs with less elastic demands. These “Ramsey-pricing” results are extended to accommodate an endogenously determined appropriation and L-resident enrollments. When H-residents and N-residents pay tuitions exceeding marginal costs, it is possible to satisfy the university’s breakeven constraint, sustain the appropriation at capacity, and admit L-residents at marginal costs. Second best tuitions charged H-residents and N-resident accommodate first-best tuitions charged L-residents.====Demand and cost functions are calibrated that replicate public university budget templates. The example used is Pennsylvania State University-Main Campus (PSU-MC), which is a Carnegie classified “very high research” public university. PSU is a “state-related” university with tuition authority that has experienced significant cuts in state appropriations per enrollment between 2001 and 2017 (SHEF, 2018); these cuts were accommodated by charging higher tuitions with limited discounting (Burd, 2018). The calculations indicate that the PSU structure can be reasonably be described as using a welfare-maximization objective.====Section 2 presents tuitions-setting structures, with the progression of the models accommodating increased endogeneity of tuitions and the appropriation. Section 3 uses the data for PSU-MC to measure efficiency and equity implications of the models. Section 4 contains a summary.

This study has been conducted to examine the repercussions of unexpected exchange rate depreciation in the Pakistan economy. Unlike the previous literature, this study utilizes a fairly large ==== constructed on the basis of Cowles Commission structural approach. The study explores that expansionary effect of exchange rate depreciation explained by the traditional theories of open economy macroeconomics persists only for one fiscal year but these theories don’t work in the long-run as contractionary phase starts in the subsequent years. Monetary and fiscal authorities are not neutral and contractionary policy is taken in response to depreciation which pushes the economy into recession. Stagflationary effects are clearly observed. However, improvement in foreign sector prolongs for a number of years and policy makers would have to face a trade-off between opposite response of output and current account balance. Hence, unexpected depreciation generates sharp cyclical fluctuations on demand which immediately transmit to supply side of the economy. In line with the views of “New Structuralists”, exchange rate depreciation may be considered as a source of shock rather than shock absorber in the case of Pakistan economy. Although this study is specifically estimated for the Pakistan economy, authors believe that their methodological contributions and results are of wider importance for policy makers in developing countries.","Expansionary and contractionary effects of unexpected exchange rate depreciation on macroeconomic aggregates has been the subject of an extensive debate for a long time, especially for developing economies. Understanding the repercussions of devaluation on rest of the economy provides important policy insights. Traditional theory of typical AD-AS open economy model is usually considered to explain expansionary effects where devaluation is expected to stimulate net exports, boost aggregate demand which causes an upward shift of aggregate demand curve. It expands aggregate output and employment level. Hence, currency depreciation is expected to have expansionary effects on real output (Bahmani-Oskooee et al., 2002; Sencicek & Upadhyaya, 2008). However, an opposing opinion contends that devaluation may have adverse effects on domestic output if contractionary effects outperform expansionary demand-side effects. Hsing (2018) explains seven types of contractionary effects from the literature which may occur from the demand side, supply side, and balance-sheet side effects. Therefore, whether devaluation is contractionary or expansionary depends on two opposing forces. Many developing countries have attempted to depreciate their currencies under the expectation of expansionary effects but they have to face contractionary effects and hence, the net effects are unclear. A number of studies have been conducted for various developing countries which give mixed results, i.e. expansionary effect, contractionary effect and neutral [see, Krugman & Taylor, 1978; Chou & Chao, 2001; Bahmani-Oskooee et al., 2002; Upadhyaya et al., 2004; Bahmani-Oskooee & Kutan, 2008; Kalyoncu et al., 2008; Sencicek & Upadhyaya, 2008; Bahmani-Oskooee & Kandil, 2009; An et al., 2014].====Currency depreciation strongly affects all sectors of a developing economy due to large import bill of oil and globalization. Literature reveals that most of the studies analyzing repercussions of exchange rate shock consider some of the macroeconomic variables using VAR/VECM framework or small structural model like Dreger and Marcellino (2007). Macroeconometric modeling, a mature field in the discipline of economics, is considered as an effective tool to explain working of national economies having a complex structure, in tracking the implications of a variety of shocks, to evaluate macroeconomic policies, to make forecasts under alternative scenarios and to provide a common framework for communication. In spite of large criticisms and accepting Lucas Critique, macroeconometric models based on Cowles Commission structural approach have established utmost importance by providing effective analytical frameworks for policy-making decisions and macroeconomic planning, (see Valadkhani, 2004; Hervé et al., 2011; Bhanumurthy & Kumawat, 2009). It induces to construct a fairly large macroeconometric model that might be used to simulate the effects of currency depreciation in the case of a developing economy. Among the developing countries, Pakistan, a small open developing economy, experienced a unique downward trend in rupee value and frequent transitions in the exchange rate systems, sometimes, cause large swings in rupee value which are followed by tight monetary and fiscal policies. A number of IMF support programs accompanied with conditionality have been adopted. These distinctive features make Pakistan economy an interesting case study for application of a macroeconometric model to simulate the effects of exchange rate shock on rest of the economy.====Like many previous studies, this paper investigates the following questions related to the exchange rate shock in a developing economy, i.e. Pakistan: what happens to different macroeconomic indicators in the economy when exchange rate depreciates unexpectedly? (Karagedikli et al., 2016; Manola et al., 2015; Hahn, 2007). Do exchange rate depreciation acts as a source of shock or shock absorber? (Artis & Ehrmann, 2006; Farrant & Peersman, 2006; Mumtaz & Sunder-Plassmann, 2010). How the monetary and fiscal authorities respond to exchange rate shock and what is the role of these policies after currency crises in a small open developing economy? (Civcir & Akcaglayan, 2010). These are important questions for a small open developing economy of Pakistan. Review of literature shows that Shahbaz et al. (2012) is the only study that has been conducted to analyze post-depreciation effects in the Pakistan economy and the analysis bases on a single equation model. To the best of authors’ knowledge, no study has been conducted such analysis by using macroeconometric framework for the Pakistan economy. Instead of analyzing exchange rate shock from a limited number of series, this study develops a fairly large macroeconometric model based on neoclassical synthesis to answer the above questions. The use of macroeconometric modelling approach may improve our understanding about the effects of exchange rate shocks in developing economies. Moreover, the developed model may also be employed for policy analyses.

Developed countries have taken intelligent manufacturing as the main direction of future manufacturing development by providing policy supports in order to seize opportunities and to take the lead. For example,====In 2015, China announced “Made in China 2025” as its main development direction of intelligent manufacturing (State Council of the PRC, 2015), in order to further enhance the level of intelligence of enterprises in R&D, production, management, service and other areas. In a country with a vast territory and large regional differences, policies often need to be piloted in a small area before being promoted nationwide in China (Liu, 2015).

We consider the effect of imposing and lifting sanctions on the target country’s traded equities and examine the differences in the reaction of politically connected firms and those without such connections. The paper focuses on Iran due to (1) its sizable financial markets, (2) imposition of sanctions of varying severity and duration on private and state-owned companies, (3) the significant presence of politically connected firms in the stock market, and (4) the unique event of the 2015 nuclear deal, resulting in fairly rapid lifting of a sizable portion of imposed sanctions. We find that sanctions affect politically connected firms more than ordinary firms, have lasting negative effects on profitability ratios, and that politically connected firms stock prices bounce back more slowly after removal of sanctions. Firms targeted by financial sanctions decrease their leverage and increase their cash holding to manage their perceived increase in risk profile.","Financial sanctions are fast becoming a potent and widely used foreign policy tool and an alternative to military power projection. They have become progressively more sophisticated, and, thanks to increasing interconnection of the global financial system, quite effective in targeting specific goals. In recent years, the United States has imposed financial sanctions against individuals and corporations in Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, among others. The economic impact of financial sanction policies, however, is an understudied subject. In this paper, we provide comprehensive documentation of how financial sanctions affect publicly traded firms in a target country. We study the imposition and removal of sanctions, their impact on equity returns of targeted firms and industries, and changes to the capital structure of the firms affected by sanctions.====We focus on sanctions imposed on Iranian corporations listed in the Tehran Stock Exchange (henceforth, TSE) between 2011 and 2016. During this period, Iran faced comprehensive economic and financial sanctions in response to its nuclear program. The reasons for our focus on Iran are fourfold. First, these sanctions were successful: The Islamic Republic of Iran (I.R.I.) suspended much of its nuclear enrichment efforts and resumed negotiation about its nuclear program with the United States and five other world powers.==== Second, Iran has a relatively large stock market and share holding features prominently in financial decisions of the better-off Iranians. As a result, financial sanctions have significant impact. The sanctions regime against Iran was unique because of its length, intensity, and diversity, providing a natural experiment to observe the full impact of modern financial sanctions on a country. Third, we have access to a unique data set that provides detailed financial information about the universe of publicly traded firms listed in the TSE, allowing for a careful measurement of the impact of sanctions. Finally, following the 2016 presidential election in the United States, tensions in U.S.-Iran relations and sanctions against Iran are again in the policy-related headlines. Thus, this is a timely study to guide policy debates.====Not surprisingly, managers and shareholders facing an episode of well-coordinated and well-executed sanctions act as the finance theory predicts they should. We find that sanctions affect politically connected firms more than ordinary firms. They have lasting negative effects that manifest in long-term stock return and profitability ratios: firms targeted by financial sanctions decrease their leverage and increase their cash holding to manage their perceived increased risk.====This study contributes to three strands of research: evaluation of financial sanctions, the behavior of politically connected firms, and capital structure of firms. We first consider the aggregate effects of economic sanctions on the target country's financial markets. We then test whether the reactions of politically connected firms (in this case, firms connected to the Iranian “deep state”), differs significantly from nonpolitically connected firms upon imposition or removal of sanctions. Third, we study how financial sanctions affect a firm's capital structure.====International law research questions the legal justification and admissibility of sanctions. International relations scholars ask whether, when, and how economic sanctions are successful. Several studies conclude that only harsh measures can convince the target to make a significant change in its plans. Examples include Lam (1990), Hufbauer and Oegg (2003), and Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, and Oegg (2009).====Evenett (2002) studies the role of U.S. Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act in ending apartheid in South Africa. Neuenkirch and Neumeier (2015) show that, on average, U.N. sanctions decreases the target country's real per capita GDP growth rate by 2.3–3.5 percentage points. They claim that these adverse effects may last as long as a decade. Caruso (2003) shows that U.S. sanctions lead to a 0.5–0.9 percentage point reduction in the GDP growth of the target country in a 7-year period on average. Bapat and Morgan (2009) argue that multilateral sanctions work better than unilateral sanctions. Afesorgbor (2019) shows that imposed sanctions lead to a decrease in trade between the imposer and target while the threat of sanction actually increases the flow of trade. Barseghyan (2019) shows that counter-sanctions enacted by Russia against agricultural imports boosted productivity and income in that sector, and partially counterbalanced declines in real GDP per capita and FDI net inflows. Golikova and Kuznetsov (2017) use a survey of manufacturing companies in Russia in a qualitative study. They document the claims of surveyed managers who believe that sanctions negatively impact the better-performing, more globalized firms. Shirazi, Azarbaiejani, and Sameti (2016) conclude that the sanctions imposed on Iran negatively affected its exports: exports declined by 33% between 2012 to 2014.====Rigorous studies of financial sanctions are scarce. Ahn and Ludema (2020, 2019) measure the impact of targeted sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union against Russian firms. Their findings imply significant costs to target firms and relatively light collateral damage inflicted on the rest of the economy. In a study closely related to ours, Draca, Garred, Stickland, and Warrinnier (2019) measure the returns of a portfolio of firms with links to the Iranian deep state to news coverage of nuclear negotiations. They argue that sanctions against Iran were successful in hitting deep-state-connected firms, which was the primary target of the U.S. Treasury. The two studies differ in aims, construction of data, and methods. Draca et al. focus on the short-term impact of news (especially sanction and removal of sanctions announcements) on stock returns of deep-state connected firms. Their study is limited in scope and their setting is based on a number of empirically counterfactual assumptions. Our study is wider in scope and more comprehensive. We investigate both short-term (event study) and longer-term effects of sanctions on designated firms and industries.====We also contribute to the literature on politically connected firms. Fisman (2001), Faccio (2006), Faccio and Parsley (2009), and Acemoglu, Johnson, Kermani, Kwak, and Mitton (2016) study the relation between political connections and firms valuation. A higher possibility of a government bailout during episodes of distress is an important factor that increases the value of politically connected firms; see Faccio, Masulis, and McConnell (2006). Acemoglu, Hassan, and Tahoun (2017) study the impact of political uncertainty (in the form of street protests) on the valuation of politically connected firms in Egypt. Fischer, Heinkel, and Zechner (1989) and Hovakimian, Opler, and Titman (2001) show that firms periodically readjust their capital structure toward a target ratio. The target ratio changes in response to changes in firm’s characteristics and business environment. High leverage is associated with higher risk; as a result, when a firm becomes risky one of its options is reducing its leverage. For example, cash flow volatility is associated with lower leverage (Bradley, Jarrell, & Kim, 1984; Wald, 1999; Booth, Aivazian, Demirguc-Kunt, & Maksimovic, 2001). Faccio, Lang, and Young (2001) show that in a weak protection environment, higher leverage gives the controlling shareholder more opportunity to expropriate. Boubakri, Cosset, and Saffar (2012) show that firms increase their leverage the more politically connected they become. Boubakri, El Ghoul, and Saffar (2013) study the cash-holding behavior of politically connected firms. Saeed, Belghitar, and Clark (2015) find that Pakistani firms with political connection had higher leverage, are less efficient, and that political connection is associated with negative firm performance.====The rest of the paper is structured as follow.

Despite the recognition of its importance, especially brought to the forefront by the challenges of the coronavirus crises, formal research on the contribution of supply chain logistics is less forthcoming. This paper uses data on 130 nations to examine the relative effects of different aspects of supply chain logistics, including overall logistics performance, and the performance of the input and output dimensions of logistics, on economic growth. The results show that improvements in the supply chain logistics performance yield positive growth dividends. Further, the input and output dimensions of logistics performance have positive growth effects, with some quantitative differences. Significantly, the growth impact of logistics performance varies across nations with different growth rates. Implications for public policy and ==== for COVID-19 initiatives are discussed.","Economic growth remains the main driver of the well-being of nations and for the viability of their political systems. However, the nations’ growth trajectories are facing unexpected challenges in the wake of the recent coronavirus crisis. This calls for a renewed examination of the drivers of economic growth, especially with regard to factors pertinent to the present situation.====Individual nations, depending upon their comparative advantages and focus, are beginning to recognize the supply chain challenges posed by lockdowns in the wake of the coronavirus spread (see, for example, a related news report from U.S.-Mexico: ====).==== Not only are the supply chain disruptions making lives difficult for residents and firms, such disruptions (especially related to the medical and safety equipment and now vaccines) can prolong the current crisis, thus potentially have a compound effect.==== Even more challenging (and unknown) would be the ability of supply chains to run smoothly and in a coordinated and timely fashion when the lockdowns are finally lifted. Thus, ascertaining the possible impacts of disruptions under alternative scenarios should help in planning and recovery once the uncertainty is resolved. With increased globalization and specialization of production across nations, disruptions even in a single nation that is the source of crucial inputs can have adverse impacts on global supply chains (see ====).====). While fiscal federalism has been shown to benefit economic growth (====), in this pandemic the uneven responses across governments may have negatively impacted the sequential workings of supply chains, including health care supply chains.====The global supply chain has been undoubtedly disrupted in the past, most recently during the 2008–2009 financial crash (====COVID-19 initially impacted China, which is at the center of many GVCs, disrupting the supply chain (see ====). On the demand side, as the lockdown continues and consumers’ physical spending is decreasing, global demand continues to fall. Global oil prices are already showing the impact COVID-19 has on supply and demand (====).====Worldwide oil demand decreased during the early months of the pandemic due to the global lockdown and other factors related to COVID-19. At one point, oil prices fell over 50% from the start of 2020 and many suppliers planned to cut production as demand fell (====). Oil prices have since somewhat recovered as travel restrictions have loosened (====). However, this may have long term impacts as the new COVID-19 variants might impact lockdown policies, as well as the supply and demand. Currently, the end period of the ongoing crisis is uncertain, which makes planning all the more challenging. Furthermore, while the shortages of essential materials, like the PPE kits, has drawn attention in the initial stages of the COVID-19 spread (====; ====), many other crucial inputs with significant growth impacts are likely impacted.====Supply chain performance is crucial to the smooth functioning of economies, and glitches can create bottlenecks with adverse implications for economic productivity and growth (see ====). However, there are many dimensions to supply chains, and their coordinated (often sequential) functioning is crucial to the smooth on-time delivery of products to consumers and inputs to businesses (====).====Whereas realization of the reliability and performance of the supply chain is not new,==== supply chain reliability has attracted renewed attention in the wake of the recent COVID-19 crisis. Governments around the world have been scrambling to ensure adequate supplies of medical equipment and lately vaccines, avoid excessive transport disruptions and ensure reliable food supplies. Besides short-run inconveniences, supply chain disruptions have longer-term effects on economic growth. For example, when tires are not delivered to manufacturers on time, trucks do not get built or are not usable, so the investment in the other dimensions of truck production (chassis, instrumentation, etc.) becomes unproductive.====Key questions addressed in this research are the following:====The findings will be instructive, especially with the worldwide supply chain challenges faced in the wake of unexpected developments posed by the coronavirus crises. Governments worldwide are trying to devise effective policy responses to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (====), often weighing the short-term tradeoffs between saving lives and saving the economy (====). In that regard, policymakers are likely to find any formal details about the influence of logistics performance to be instructive. Furthermore, if it turns out that logistics performance differently affects growth in nations with differing growth rates, then policies tailored to specific groups of nations would be preferred over blanket policies.====This paper uses data over a recent decade for over 130 nations to examine the relative effects of the different aspects of supply chain logistics on economic growth. Placing the empirical framework in a standard growth model, results show that improvements in the aggregate supply chain logistics performance yield positive growth dividends. These dividends are also present in most of the disaggregated dimensions of logistics, especially dealing with the input and output of logistics performance. Whereas investigations on the significant drivers of economic growth proliferate in the literature (see ====, ====), identification of the role of logistics performance and its dimensions appears to be novel in this work.====While supply chain challenges have been identified even in pre-COVID-19 era (see ====), the COVID-19 crisis has added urgency and uncertainty. A simulation exercise discusses some supply chain disruption scenarios and their growth implications that could provide useful in nations planning for the challenges posed by the COVID-19 and other unexpected crises.====Focusing on a specific dimension or bottleneck, i.e., the lockdown on the Hubei province in China following the coronavirus outbreak, ==== estimate the output loss in China and the consequent ripple effect on the world through supply chain linkages. They estimate that China would suffer about a 4% loss of output, and global output would drop by 1% due to the economic contraction in China.

Using annual data for the Indian economy over the period 1980–2014, we show that the perceived benefits of globalization and financial development have not trickled down; rather, has aggravated income inequality. Our results also indicate that while ","Rising inequality among the most advanced, emerging, and developing countries is a vexing developmental challenge for economists and policymakers. Despite improvements in technology, neo-liberal reforms, and the integration of countries, the benefits of the rising incomes and output growth have not been shared equally among all segments of the population (Asteriou, Dimelis, & Moudatsou, 2014). The threat generated by growing disparities has significant implications on the growth potential, welfare, and macroeconomic stability of nations (Berg, Ostry, Tsangarides, & Yakhshilikov, 2018). Hence, understanding the causes of inequality is fundamental to devising policy measures that enable a more egalitarian income distribution and address social welfare concerns.====It is argued that globalization, by way of integrating economies, culture, technology, and governance, significantly affects income inequality (e.g., Berg et al., 2018; Bergh & Nilsson, 2010; Salvatore, 2007). The extant literature focuses on different dimensions of globalization, such as trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), market integration, tax rate, etc., while explaining the distributional aspects of income. For instance, Cabral, García-Díaz, and Mollick (2016) and Adams (2008) show that globalization affects income concentration through FDI/equity flows. Similarly, Le, Nguyen, Su, and Tran-Nam (2020) and Zhou, Biswas, Bowles, and Saunders Peter (2011) show that globalization affects inequality by facilitating greater participation in international trade and international market integration.====Alongside, there has been a long-standing view that to reap the benefits of globalization, the development of the financial system is a necessary condition (Mishkin, 2006). It is argued that financial development by reducing credit constraints, will disproportionately benefit the poor and alleviate income inequality (Aghion & Bolton, 1997; Banerjee & Newman, 1991; Galor & Zeira, 1993). Therefore, globalization without a well-developed financial system can have adverse effects on the distribution of wealth and welfare (Bittencourt, Chang, Gupta, & Miller, 2019). Considering the simultaneity involved in the processes of globalization and financial development, there is a need to analyze their impacts on income inequality in unison. However, the extant literature, almost without exception, does not examine the role of globalization and financial development on income inequality in a common empirical framework. We make the first major attempt to fill this void in the literature.====This paper empirically examines the combined effects of globalization and financial development on income inequality. Specifically, we study several dimensions of globalization and financial development, affecting the income distribution in an emerging economy like India. Using annual time series data, we consider the effects of globalization (expressed in terms of economic, social, political, and an aggregate index) and financial development (comprising bank-based and stock market-based indicators) on inequality. Such an approach would help in designing and implementing an active development strategy to mitigate income inequalities.====India provides an ideal setting to explore this issue, given the two contrasting features the economy is exhibiting since the early 1990s. While on the one hand, following the twin forces of globalization and financial development, India emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world that have prompted researchers and policymakers to use epitaphs like ‘amazing India’ and ‘shining India.’ On the other hand, few observers (Anand & Thampi, 2016; Chancel & Piketty, 2019) have raised concerns about mounting inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth over the same period, with the Oxfam (2017) report placing India as the second most unequal economy in the world.====Our study extends the empirical literature in several dimensions. First, barring three theoretical attempts at analyzing the impact of globalization on income inequality amidst imperfections in the financial markets (Daisaka, Furusawa, & Yanagawa, 2014; Ehrlich & Seidel, 2019; Foellmi & Oechslin, 2010), to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has examined the effects of globalization and financial development on income inequality in a single framework. We believe such an approach would help formulate developmental policies that promote a well-developed financial system, counteract the adverse effects of the immutable forces of globalization, and provide equitable growth.====Second, by focusing on a single country setting, we dispel concerns of heterogeneity and data comparability. Prior studies on inequality (Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, & Levine, 2007; Dollar, 2005) have mainly focused on cross-country datasets, assuming that there is a universal impact of globalization, which is independent of local conditions. However, it has been observed that the impact of globalization on inequality depends critically on certain conditions that are often location and time-specific (Goldberg & Pavcnik, 2007). Serious concerns have also been raised on the quality, consistency, and comparability of cross-country datasets and inconsistent methodology, which can seriously affect not only the regression results but the level and trend in inequality (Atkinson & Brandolini, 2001, 2009). We attempt to assuage these concerns by conducting an in-depth empirical analysis of the impact of globalization and financial development on income inequality in India. Our estimation is based on plausible time-series techniques that are better suited to deal with methodological shortcomings and provide comparable and consistent findings. From a policy perspective, the circumstances prevailing in each country and the underlying institutional structure assume prominence in designing policies to ensure egalitarian income distribution amidst globalization and financial development.====Third, we use the KOF index of globalization to study the impact of globalization on income distribution. The KOF index of globalization is multifaceted and captures different dimensions of globalization (economic, social, and political) that could affect inequality and redistribution. The use of the KOF index of globalization not only alleviates the problems of multicollinearity and omitted variable bias (Dreher, 2006; Lockwood, 2004) that plagued earlier studies based on Kearney (2004) globalization index (Martens & Zywietz, 2006), but also helps in ascertaining the direct implications of different aspects of globalization on income inequality. Hence, our findings are more holistic and provide an intricate perspective in comparison to the existing studies. Such an approach would also equip the policymakers to devise concomitant policies for ushering inclusive growth.====Our test results indicate that income inequality increases with the KOF index of globalization. While all three KOF indices of globalization alongside the overall index are positively associated with income inequality, economic globalization appears to be the most significant contributor to income inequality. Besides, we observe that while inflation aggravates income inequality, education seems to alleviate the differential effect. The causality test results suggest a unidirectional causality running from globalization and financial development to income inequality.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides data and the methodological framework. Empirical results and interpretations are presented in Section 3.

Using the Legatum Prosperity Index across 142 countries as a proxy for prosperity, we find strong evidence of the positive causal mechanisms among dimensions of prosperity. This implies that individual dimensions of prosperity should not be weighted equally in designing policies that support prosperity of nations. In line with ====, we find that education and the pupil to teacher ratio are the key policy drivers of prosperity enhancement.","The measurement of country’s prosperity has long been a controversial issue. Policymakers traditionally focus on the accumulation of material wealth and use gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of prosperity of nations because GDP is tangible and well understood by many people. A country with higher GDP per capita is generally considered to be a better place to live in. Though the value of GDP in this context should not be underestimated, some academics cast doubt on using only GDP as a primary benchmark of prosperity of nations. One critique is that GDP is a narrow measure of prosperity and does not reflect the way people perceive their wellbeing and happiness (e.g., Bonaiuto et al., 2015; Fleurbaey, 2009; Stiglitz et al., 2009). Critics also argue that material prosperity distracts people from other substantial values such as altruism and justice (Diener and Diener, 1995; Droge et al., 1993). Therefore, a broader definition of country’s prosperity is more than just the material wealth represented by GDP. A country that fails to meet the basic human needs and the quality of life of its citizens is difficult to achieve sustainable development goals. In this regard, there have been initiatives across the world to measure prosperity relied on levels of both income and wellbeing.====As the public has a deep desire for higher levels of income and wellbeing, so does the need to precisely assess prosperity. However, prosperity is inherently complex concept with tradeoffs among multidimensional prosperity measures (e.g., Aristei and Perugini, 2010; Cifuentes et al., 2016). To capture the complexity of prosperity, the evaluation of prosperity often requires the integration of multiple indicators into the composite index, which is a well-known tool for evaluating the country’s performance on prosperity creations. Among a number of prosperity indices, the Legatum Prosperity Index provides a unique insight into both material wealth and wellbeing dimensions of prosperity. In addition to the individual sub-index scores, the Legatum Prosperity Index provides the overall score and the ranking based on the equally-weighted aggregation of the sub-index scores.====The development of the overall index tends to be the default option used to simplify multidimensional indicators, as it provides a fast technical synthesis (Wong, 2015). Due to its simplicity, the equally-weighted overall score is the most commonly used aggregation method to summarize multiple indicators in a way that facilitates assessment and comparison (e.g., Becker et al., 2017; Goyal and Rahman, 2015). However, this paper argues that the use of the overall score of the Legatum Prosperity Index as a main policy tool is controversial because the simple average overall score assumes that each sub-index has an equal importance – that the individual sub-indices have an identical contribution to prosperity. Moreover, the simple aggregate average assumes that the composite measures of prosperity are independent, without any causal interrelation among individual sub-indices. This paper therefore removes these two flawed assumptions of the Legatum Prosperity Index and addresses research questions on three main themes: How much effect does each sub-index have on prosperity? Are there causal relationships between the eight sub-indices of prosperity? How should policymakers identify the critical drivers of prosperity for policy reforms?====To tackle the above research questions, this paper applies a four-stage integrative methodology: Expectation Maximization (EM) cluster analysis, Bayesian Network classifiers with Tree Augmented NaiveBayes (BN-TAN) data mining, partial least square (PLS) path modeling and importance-performance analysis (IPA). This methodology enables policymakers to examine the direct and indirect causal interrelations between sub-indices of the Legatum Prosperity Index, estimates the relative importance of individual sub-indices and pinpoints the critical sub-indices for reform priorities. To the best of knowledge, this four-stage methodology is the first attempt to construct pathways to prosperity of nations proxied by of the Legatum Prosperity Index. This paper finds strong evidence of the direct and indirect causal interdependences and the positive synergistic effects among sub-indices of prosperity, with unequal impacts of individual sub-indices on prosperity. Of all the sub-indices of prosperity, education is the most critical driver of prosperity enhancement, followed by economy, health, governance, safety and security, entrepreneurship and opportunity, personal freedom, and social capital. In line with human capital theory, the results of this study suggest that policymakers should give the first priority to improving the pupil to teacher ratio, the most critical variable of the education sub-index. The top-down approach to prioritizing the sub-indices and variables of the Legatum Prosperity Index has important implications for policy formation and assessment.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents theoretical framework and hypothesis development. Section 3 describes the Legatum Prosperity Index. Section 4 presents the four-stage methodology.

The present study aims to identify the interaction among the selected determinants that have brought the paradigm change. Numerous studies have been done to explore the determinants that have brought globalization; however, a few research pieces have been conducted to analyze the reasons behind the people’s displeasure after globalization. The contemporary study attempts to fill the above gap by studying the interplay among the determinants leading to the deglobalization process. We have used the modified total interpretive structural modeling to explore the relationship between the determinant that led to deglobalization. Incorporating polarity in TISM modeling has refined the model and made it more explanatory. The developed model is a novel initiative in studying the determinants that have led to the deglobalization process. In addition to it, we have also examined how the rising skepticism against globalization influences countries’ policy formation.","In recent times, one of the prevalent debates is about the changing attitudes concerning globalization. Researchers observed numerous manifestations against globalism, significantly pulling down free trade agreements, dismantling the foreign investment, actions against immigrants, and many more. According to Warburton (2017), recent developments in the past show that trade tariffs have increased, and many countries have put more trade protectionist measures into practice after the recession in the 2008 period. The populist wing is gaining supremacy in economies as diverse as Poland, Hungary, France, U.K., and the Netherlands, spreading nationalistic, anti-immigrant, xenophobic messages across the board. Cuervo Cazurrra et al. (2017) observe that populists such as Evo Morales in Bolivia and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela over turned pro-market policy, restricted foreign investment, and curbed imports in their countries.====After the Great Recession, the U.S. president raises strident opposition for an open economy and repudiate prevailing trade agreements. Zhang (2018) states that nearly fifty-two percent of the British electorate choose to leave the European Union following the campaign against immigrants’ intrusion. Ninety-eight percent of Hungarian constituency members in October 2016 opt to turn down the proposal concerning refugees’ settlement in their country (Kobrin, 2017). On May 12, 2020, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ that translates into ‘self-reliant India’ to encourage domestic manufacturing. He visioned to make India self-generating and self-sustaining. In passing years, we have also noticed multitudinous populist movements like ‘Five Star Movement’ in Italy, and ‘Podemos’ in Spain, the rise of the national party ‘Syriza’ in Greece pushing back global economy.====Furthermore, in the Taormina G7 summit, leaders have addressed the challenges resulting from the global economy, particularly ‘migration,’ ‘increasing wage inequity, ‘price instability, and ‘job displacements.’ Kobrin (2017) argues that world trade (exports and imports) rose gradually from 1990 to 2008 but fell by 14% (as a percentage of GDP) in 2009 due to recession and then improved slightly, though never touched the 2008 level again. FDI inflows (as a percent of gross capital formation) also portrays the same trend, expanding swiftly from 1990 to 2000, and falling then after due to the dotcom bust.

This behaviour is attributable to the slower ,"Like the other central banks of advanced countries, the ECB reacted to the COVID-19 crisis promptly and effectively. In the past, however, compared to other central banks – notably, the Fed – it had been seen to react slowly to shocks. This had happened in the cases of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the sovereign debt crisis and during the risk of deflation that emerged in the eurozone between 2014 and 2016.====The ECB's overly gradual reaction to these past shocks has been attributed by various scholars as either due to the tug of war within the Governing Council of this institution between “doves” and “hawks” or to the anti-inflationary ideological bias prevalent in its board.====Other scholars, applying the robust control approach, have concluded that the timely reaction of the ECB to the COVID-19 crisis was an “aggressive” strategy adopted by a decision-maker operating in conditions of uncertainty. However, this explanation does not explain the different timescales with which the ECB reacted to previous shocks compared to that triggered by the pandemic.====This paper seeks to establish a link between the past behaviour of the ECB and that taken to the most recent crisis. In particular, we advance the hypothesis that, under conditions of uncertainty, the central bank of a monetary union between fiscally sovereign countries reacts more slowly than the other central banks because it learns more slowly. This can explain the behaviour of ECB and its change in recent years. In fact, the GFC and the sovereign debt crisis had a negative effect on the financial integration of this area.

Some scholars argue that in recent years this policy became too accommodative.==== We show that this view does not take into account the effects, on the transmission of monetary impulses, caused by the lower level of financial integration of eurozone financial markets following on from the crises of 2008 and 2011.====The paper proceeds as follows.

For trade negotiations between the EU and U.S., beef has emerged as an important topic. To export to the EU, U.S. producers face a complex series of compliance costs that occur on multiple points along the supply chain. However, the current approach to measuring NTMs does so in an abstract manner; this paper applies a more detailed, supply chain (SC) approach to measure those costs. Our analysis finds that the SC approach comprehensively accounts for the different components of NTM costs and leads to more meaningful implications for interpreting the welfare impacts of removing NTMs.","Agriculture is one of the most protected sectors in international trade, with higher tariffs than manufacturing (Perali, Pieroni, & Standardi, 2012), sensitive sectors that have make trade negotiations difficult (Baldwin, 2009), tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) that limit market access (Beckman, Dyck, & Heerman, 2017), and the significance of non-tariff measures (NTMs) impeding trade more than for other sectors (Li & Beghin, 2012). Some sectors face more trade barriers than others. Dairy is one of the most protected sectors (Owen & Winchester, 2014), as are meat products, rice, and sugar. These products tend to be difficult to negotiate even in regional trade agreements (RTAs), especially for developed countries who have NTMs in place. The EU-U.S. Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is one such RTA where NTMs feature prominently (Blind & Mueller, 2019).==== In particular, issues revolve around NTMs such as added hormones in beef production, the use of ractopamine in pork production, and pathogen reduction treatments in poultry (Beckman & Arita, 2016). The beef issue is particularly interesting as the U.S. has a program specifically dedicated to producing non-hormone treated cattle (NHTC) that is allowed into the EU.====NTMs have become an important topic in trade policy discussion and analysis as tariffs have declined and countries have increased the use of NTMs. Compared to tariffs, data from Bekkers (2019) indicates that the ad-valorem equivalent (AVE) of NTMs are often the same, or higher, than the tariffs facing agriculture. Soon and Thompson (2020) estimate the NTM on Russian chicken imports as 30–40% AVE, which has remained relatively stable over the years, despite a decline in the actual tariff from 46 to 1%. However, NTMs are not directly observable, so it is often difficult to identify and measure their effects on trade (Fugazza & Maur, 2008). Given that TTIP would involve the two largest economies in the world, there has been a great deal of research on the potential impacts. Given that tariffs are relatively low between the two regions, most research has focused on NTMs, especially given that they are hidden obstacles to trade and socio-economic outcomes. Berden, Francois, Thelle, and Tamminen (2009); Disdier and Marette (2010); Fontagné, Gourdon, and Jean (2013); Francois, Manchin, Norberg, Pindyuk, and Tomberger (2013) and Egger, Francois, Manchin, and Nelson (2015) are some examples—and the research generated in estimating NTMs in TTIP have been used in other lines of research (e.g., Veld, 2019—and the macro-economic benefits of the EU single market).====The above-mentioned papers made great strides in providing information on NTMs; however, they tend to take an indirect approach==== using a gravity model—without any mention of the underlying issues that prompted the NTM in the first place. As such, all the mentioned papers reduce some portion of the NTM, e.g., 10, 25, or 50%. However, in many agricultural sectors, the NTMs in place are not such that there can be some portion removed. This is the case for NHTC. From birth to the ultimate final sale of the beef product, production of this product must include costly compliance procedures required to enter the EU market. These include up-front enrollment costs for certification programs for ranchers, lost feed efficiency for feedlots, traceability and testing requirements for packers, and additional transaction cost for exporters. Beyond compliance costs, U.S. non-hormone treated beef also requires higher marketing and distribution expenditures. These costs are the exact definition of an NTM—added costs for a producer in an exporting country to meet the standards of an importing country.====Researchers often plug the gravity estimates of NTMs into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, partitioning the NTM cost to importers, exporters, or as an iceberg trade costs. The choice of representation has important implications for the level and distribution of the welfare results of policies and policy reform. However, an indirect cost estimation method characterizes a cost as a lump sum, and the decision on how to distribute those NTM costs in a CGE model is often made in an ad hoc manner. All in all, the gravity approach does not really help trade negotiators who go commodity by commodity (or by tariff-line); and another, more detailed approach, should be used.====This paper contributes to the NTM/CGE literature by implementing a supply chain approach to measure the effects of eliminating NTMs for U.S. beef exports to the EU. Supply chain analysis offers a more direct and comprehensive approach for estimating NTM costs. Costs are identified by tracing out price-cost differentials from different points along the supply chain: a good from its production to its ultimate final sale, detailing how and where the producers and sellers of the product encounter regulations and compliance requirements. Because the supply chain approach provides detailed information on the incidence of regulatory costs, it provides insight into how to represent NTM costs in the CGE model and supports a more informed and accurate modeling of the trade and welfare impacts of changes in NTM policies. The detailed tracing of costs allows us to decompose NTM costs for beef across the various agents along the supply chain within our CGE model, thereby capturing the important distorting effects of the NTM, as well as carefully quantifying its distributional impacts. We show how our approach compares to conventional gravity model attempts at estimating NTM effects. While the two methodologies are very different and thus their magnitudes are not directly comparable, we draw upon the comparison to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the supply chain approach.",Hidden obstacles to trade: The case of the EU’s Ban on beef hormones,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820301204,16 December 2020,2020,Research Article,158.0

The resulting index is used to investigate the impact of the financial sector reforms in Pakistan on economic growth. Using the Markov regime-switching model over the period 1972–2015, the empirical results showed that the examined relationship is nonlinear, nonmonotonic, state-dependent, and better described by the two-state Markov switching model characterized by the high growth regime and low growth regime. Despite the positive impact of financial liberalization on economic growth in both the high and low growth regimes, financial liberalization relatively strongly affects real GDP growth in the high growth regime. The results further demonstrate that transition probabilities establish an inordinate episode of the low growth regime. Furthermore, the high growth regime is relatively short-lived than the low growth regime. Among the other variables, ","Do financial sector reforms spur economic growth? The answer to this fundamental question continues to preoccupy and attract the attention of academicians, central bank(s) policymakers, and international financial organizations (Bandiera et al., 2000; Bekaert et al., 2005; Arestis et al., 2001; Bumann et al., 2013; Durusu-Ciftci et al., 2017; Pan & Mishra, 2018). In particular, understanding the channels through which financial reforms affect the macro economy is of particular help for policymakers designing optimal economic policies to stimulate economic growth (King & Levine, 1993; Levine et al., 2000; Ibrahim & Alagidede, 2018). Although the positive links between financial reforms and economic growth are well established for developed countries, the type and extent of the relationship remain indeterminate for developing countries (Arestis & Demetriades, 1999; Arun & Turner, 2003; Moore et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 2019).====Empirically, several arguments have been advanced to explain this ambiguity. One of the substantial reasons is that the financial liberalization wave that has spread among most of the developing countries during the mid-1980s and 1990s was not volunteered but was regulated under the pressure of financial globalization and the welling to emulate some developed countries’ success stories (see Bandiera et al., 2000). A second reason that explains this unclear relationship for developing economies is that financial reforms are a phased process rather than an exclusive event (Bandiera et al., 2000). In general, for developing economies, it is difficult to achieve the financial reforms process in an optimal manner because of political and economic instability, lack of long-run economic vision, inconsistent financial and real sector policies, and weak institutions.====However, theoretically, researchers have agreed on the direct (positive) relationship between financial reforms and economic growth (Demirguç-Kunt & Huizinga, 1999; Bandiera et al., 2000; Bekaert et al., 2005; Bonfiglioli, 2005; Rahman et al., 2020a). This link can be traced in the early writings of Schumpeter (1911), who highlighted the significance of the financial sector in promoting economic growth through the provision of efficient financial services. Subsequently, McKinnon (1973) and Shaw (1973) argued that a repressive financial system through ceilings on interest rates, higher reserve requirements, directed credit programs, and other quantitative restrictions on capital allocation impedes financial liberalization. They hypothesized that repressive financial markets hinder efficient allocation of resources, disrupt savings and investments equation, increase financial market segmentation, upsurge the margin of financial intermediaries, decrease investment, and hence retard economic growth in developing countries (Abu-Bader & Abu-Qarn, 2008; Naveed & Mahmood, 2019).====Empirically, since the seminal contributions by Schumpeter (1911), McKinnon (1973), and Shaw (1973), a large body of literature has acknowledged the important role of the financial sector in economic growth (King & Levine, 1993; Levine, 2005; Khan et al., 2005; Jalil & Ma, 2008; Bittencourt, 2012; Chandio, 2014). These researchers have concluded that sustainable economic growth depends mainly on a developed financial system. Thus, an efficient financial system mobilizes savings and accelerates efficient allocation of resources through investments (Greenwood et al., 2010), contributes high-return investments through risk sharing (Saint-Paul, 1992), reduces information costs, and enhances innovation activities (Aghion et al., 2005). However, many authors have presented skeptical views on the relationship between finance and growth. For example, the financial sector may lead to high systemic risk (Gennaioli et al., 2012) and cause sub-optimal low savings (Jappelli & Pagano, 1994), overheated economic capacity (Zeira, 1999), sub-optimal high allocation of the labor force to the financial institutions (Bolton et al., 2011), and the exertion of an inefficiently high cost on the economy (Santomero & Seater, 2000).====A common specificity shared by most of the empirical studies on the relationship between finance and growth is the use of a linear specification (inter alia, King & Levine, 1993; Levine et al., 2000; Beck et al., 2000; Khan et al., 2005; Jalil & Ma, 2008; Law & Singh, 2014). However, shifts in financial reform policies and their implementation are a phased process where the expected outcome may take a lot of time; thus, we posit that the reform process may distort the linear relationship and provide the basis for the presence of nonlinear connections between financial liberalization and growth. For instance, the existence of an asymmetric relationship suggests that economic growth responds to financial reforms in the pre- and post-reform period differently. It further suggests that changes in financial policies might influence the finance–growth relationship differently in a different state of policy intervention (Rioja & Valev, 2004). It can be argued that when macroeconomic variables change behavior because of a shift in regime, the linear models perform poorly in explaining the effect of policy changes. Despite the importance of policy changes in the finance–growth relationship, scant research has investigated the nonlinear impacts of financial reforms on economic growth in the case of Pakistan.====To fill the gap empirically, this paper uses the Markov switching model to examine the impact of financial reforms on economic growth in a developing country, namely Pakistan. This study examines the case of Pakistan for several reasons. First, in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the Government of Pakistan (GoP) implemented a series of financial reforms to liberalize its financial sector (see the major reforms matrix in Table A in Supplementary material).==== The main objective of financial sector reforms was to instill competition for creating a level playing field and remove distortions and financial market segmentation. The reforms also aimed to eliminate directed and subsidized credit schemes, remove entry barriers, enhance competition and efficiency, strengthen the supervisory role of the State Bank of Pakistan, liberalize the foreign exchange regime, and promote technological upgradation of the banking industry (Naveed & Mahmood, 2019). Second, although Pakistan took the initiative to reform its financial system in the late 1980s, almost 28 years later, the country remains a developing country. Third, in the post-financial reform period, the real GDP growth remained at 4.37% while it was 5.78% in the pre-reform period, which questions the efficiency and viability of the different financial reforms.====The contribution of this paper to the existing literature is twofold. First, this study uses the newly developed econometric technique, namely the dynamic factor model (DFM) to construct a financial liberalization index (FLI) and examines robustness by using principal component analysis (====). According to our review of the literature, no study used the DFM method to construct FLI previously. Second, unlike previous studies that used linear models to investigate the finance–growth nexus, this study examines the relationship by using the Markov switching (====) technique propounded by Hamilton (1989).==== The main reason that we use the ==== model is that financial sector reforms caused pronounced changes in the implementation of policies related to financial and monetary sectors in Pakistan since the 1990s. Thereby, successful fiscal and monetary policy responses affect the behavior of macroeconomic variables and their relations.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical and empirical review of the finance–growth literature. Section 3 discusses the empirical methodology.

Using data from Stability and Convergence Programmes and the European Commission’s Spring Forecasts, evidence is presented here which indicates deficiencies in official forecasting in the EU arising under the enhanced EU fiscal framework. Forecasts of output growth are unduly pessimistic, irrational, and influenced by recent economic activity. The article considers the reasons for and implications of such biases and proposes improvements to forecasting processes that could address these issues.","The formulation of budgetary policy requires accurate forecasts of future economic activity. Output growth rate forecasts are central both to agents’ overall perception of how the economy is expected to perform and to government deficit and debt projections which are dependent on cyclical conditions in the economy. Forecast errors can lead to fiscal policy not delivering on budgetary targets. This can undermine the standing of the ministry of finance or relevant body among the public. Inaccurate assessments of growth prospects may also cause government to adopt budgetary policy that is expected ==== to stabilise output growth over the economic cycle but which proves ill-advised in retrospect given the errors in forecasting output growth.====The need for forecasting accuracy is particularly important in the EU given its institutional structure. There is an onus on governments to exercise effective budgetary policy at the national level and to abide by cross-EU fiscal rules by not violating deficit and debt targets laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. Forecast errors by member states can jeopardise those targets being met, which can serve to undermine the credibility of the EU fiscal rules and go against the collective responsibility of member states to one another of maintaining prudent fiscal policy. The monitoring of adherence to these numerical targets – set out by member states in Stability and Convergence Programmes (henceforth, SCPs) – occurs through a preventive arm involving surveillance of national public finances. SCPs contain member states’ budgetary and economic forecasts over a medium-term horizon (including the current year) and the data contained in the programmes are central to the appraisal of member states’ adherence to the EU fiscal rules.====The question that then follows, from a policy perspective, is how accurate are the output growth rates – specifically, GDP growth rate forecasts – used in formulating budgetary targets in EU member states and are they are subject to biases and other inefficiencies? There are ==== grounds for expecting biases to arise in member states’ forecasts given the EU fiscal rules’ emphasis on ==== performance (as captured in the budgetary forecasts). Jonung and Larch (2006) identify an “optimism bias” among the four largest EU member states (Germany, France, Italy, and the UK), where official output growth forecasts, on average, over-estimated the underlying speed of growth of the economy. When realised output growth proves less than expected, as an optimism bias implies, then budgetary outcomes will prove to be poorer than initially projected, all else being equal. This increases the risk of EU deficit and debt thresholds being violated and may even call into question the overall fiscal and economic direction that a member state is taking. Frankel (2011) and Frankel and Schreger (2013) find member states’ official government forecasts having a particularly large positive bias, which may explain frequent violations of the excessive deficit threshold occurring ====.====There is also evidence that the EU fiscal rules create biases in official forecasts. Beetsma, Giuliodori, and Wierts (2009) use the phrase “planning to cheat” to describe the budgetary behaviour of member states bound by the EU fiscal rules. This includes governments failing to implement planned budgetary adjustments in full and the greater use of stock-flow adjustments when budgetary plans are more ambitious. In relation to the European Commission, Gilbert and de Jong (2017) hypothesise and illustrate that its forecasts are biased upwards when member states expect EU fiscal rules to hold.====Against this background, major EU fiscal rules reforms in the early 2010s were adopted, in part, to improve the forecasting performance of member states. The European Semester, in effect since 2011, allows for a more intrusive examination of member states’ budgetary plans over the medium-term horizon, while the Fiscal Compact, effective since 2013, provided for autonomous oversight of member states’ forecasting at the national level including a role for independent forecasting authorities.====This article examines whether biases are present, or absent, in official output growth forecasts since 2013 when these substantial reforms took effect. It does so using current year and one-year-ahead projections for the real GDP growth rate from both member states’ SCPs and the European Commission’s Spring Forecasts, along with outturn data from the EU AMECO database. Including the Commission’s projections alongside those of the member states in the empirical analysis sheds light on whether any shortcomings in forecasting are shared between both entities.====An econometric investigation indicates that deficiencies remain evident in official forecasts in the EU despite the reforms put in place in the early 2010s. The empirical analysis shows that output growth forecasts are unduly pessimistic, are irrational, and are influenced by recent economic activity. This holds for both the member states’ and Commission’s forecasts. Output gap forecasts also have an influence on output growth projections. The implications of these findings along with suggested improvements to the forecasting process to address them are considered in the final section.",Are official forecasts of output growth in the EU still biased?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820301216,7 December 2020,2020,Research Article,160.0

Another feature of our research is that we analyse their effects on the FGT class of poverty indices. The results are similar in as much as direction of association is concerned but the elasticities vary with the poverty index. The growth elasticities are negative and significant for all poverty indices. In all three cases, the disparity between the income share of the top 1% and share of the bottom 50% is associated with greater poverty. These elasticities are much higher than the (absolute) income elasticities except in the case of the poverty gap. The largest increase occurs in the poverty gap squared – a 1% greater income disparity is associated with a 1.24% higher value of this index. Thus the consequences of even a small increase in the income disparity are alarming for the poorest.","Plutarch was right when he said that an imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics. Much has been written to demonstrate that overall income inequality hurts the poor (Imai, Cheng, & Gaiha, 2017; Gaiha, Imai, & Nandhi, 2009; Kulkarni and Gaiha, 2018a, Kulkarni and Gaiha, 2018b, Ravallion, 2016; ==== (WDR), 2006). However, following Piketty's (2014) magnum opus, ==== the focus has shifted to rapid growth of income shares of the top 1% as a by-product of growth in the developed countries. In a more recent contribution, Chancel and Piketty (2017) offer a rich and unique description of evolution of income inequality in India in terms of income shares and incomes in the bottom 50%, the middle 40% and top 10% (as well as top 1%, 0.1%, and 0.001%), combining household survey data, tax returns and other specialised surveys.====WDR 2006 makes a persuasive case for equity as the guiding principle of development. Equity denotes equality of opportunities to pursue a life of one's choice and protection from extreme deprivation. In this sense, equity is complementary to long-term prosperity. Equity influences development in two ways: inequalities of power and wealth result in waste and inefficient use of productive resources, and impair institutional development. Economic inequality is the root of political power inequality which results in more economic inequality.====There is a strong link between differences in wealth and power (Gabardo, Pereima, & Einloft, 2017) and inefficient allocation of resources. No less worrying is the link between inequality in wealth and power and functioning of local institutions. WDR 2006 is emphatic that unequal power also impedes innovation and risk-taking.====In a not-so-subtle and thinly disguised defence of its own agenda, WDR dismisses the dichotomy between policies for growth and for equity as false. Subsequently, WDR 2006 argues that inequitable policy outcomes are better dealt with through a safety net than by fine-tuning of policy reforms (adverse income distributional outcomes of trade policy reforms are better mitigated, for example, through workfare). This is intriguing, as it invokes the dichotomy rejected earlier as false.====The main objective of the present study is considerably restricted. We examine the effects of income (measured as per capita income of a state), ratio of income share of the top 1% to that of the bottom 50%, and their interaction or joint effect on the FGT class of poverty indices.==== The analysis is based on a nation-wide panel survey covering the period 2005–12, India Human Development Survey (IHDS, 2015). Accordingly, panel data models have been used to capture state heterogeneity.====The scheme is as follows. Section 2 reviews selected studies that focus on inter-relationships between growth-poverty and inequality. Section 3 reviews salient features of the IHDS data.

The essence of this process is to build a hierarchy structure for the problem considered. The hierarchy consists of the main goal, the sub-goals and the tasks. At each hierarchy level, the importance of strategic factors is pairwise compared by experts. Experts’ opinions are the basis for the assessment of each strategic factor. The research was based on data from a survey among the councilors of the urban and rural municipality of Stęszew in the Wielkopolska Voivodeship in Poland in 2017. The proposed approach to the construction of the model and the assessment of strategic factors for administrative units is a universal tool for local and regional development planning.","The development of the theory of planning differed between the countries depending on the scientific field on which emphasis was placed. The approaches to development planning were rather not integrated due to socio-political or scientific conditions. These divergences were particularly noticeable in the postwar period but began to disappear over time (Nijkamp & van Delft, 1977, p. 4). However, the faster development of that concepts was witnessed in the post-war period because of the destructive effects of war in Europe, Asia and Middle East, the decolonization process and the Cold War (one of the reasons behind the economic rivalry between Eastern and Western countries) (Witkowski, 2008). In the theory of economic has long dominated by exogenous development theories. They are based on exogenous factors which notably include the state regional policy. According to these concepts, regional development is driven by strong state intervention measures or by regulatory functions of the market mechanism. They are based on the theory of what is referred to as externalities and effects of scale (which are underpinned by the Keynesian theory). That concept started to lose popularity in late 1980s for reasons which include the crisis of a centralized state (Kudłacz, 2007).====The opposite of the exogenous development concept is the endogenous development concept based on endogenous factors. Regional development should be modeled by independent local government units, and should be based on the entrepreneurship and innovativeness of local communities. This concept was initiated in early 1980s in France and in some third world countries. A compromise between the exogenous and endogenous concepts is the decentralized development concept. It combines the interests of local communities with country-level policy priorities. Currently, it is the dominant development concept, including in Poland. The experience of European countries shows that local development is powered by the combined impact of measures taken by the government and by entities active in the territory concerned, depends significantly on economic, social, administrative and political conditions. In European Union countries is a wide variety of concepts for local development (e.g. Clark, Palaskas, Tracey, & Tsampra, 2004; North & Smallbone, 2006; Copus & Skuras, 2006, Labrianidis & Kalogeressis, 2006). The use of endogenous potential prevails in most of today’s concepts. That potential can be activated by adequate socioeconomic and political mechanisms. Therefore, these actions need to be appropriately planned and modeled.====Modeling local development is a complex multi-stage process which relies on diverse methods (cf. Bockermann, Meyer, Omann, & Spangenberg, 2005; Psaltopoulos, Balamou, Skuras, Ratinger, & Sieber, 2011; Destradi & Gundlach, 2014). Problems that emerge when modeling development are the reason why attempts were made to formally analyze the development of administrative units and to design systems which support that process based on quantitative methods. Modeling the future image of local government units is among the key stages in development planning, and must be preceded by a reliable diagnosis of their current condition. The goal sought by development planning should be to establish a development plan. The basic elements of the development planning process include endogenous and exogenous development factors, development objectives and implementation tasks. Local development modeling means defining the main development goal, secondary goals, implementation tasks and their interrelationships. It is a process that enables us to understand the realities of a local unit which is reflected in a formal structure i.e. a model. Therefore, the model is a simplified representation of reality. Though it may take various forms, its essential role is to map the socio-economic realities of a local administrative unit. This can be done using analytic hierarchy and network processes which are a part of ==== (MCDM) methods. As a scientific discipline, MCDM are a relatively new concept developed only around 40 years ago. The development of MCDM is strictly related to that of IT. On one hand, the quick development of IT in recent years has enabled a systematic analysis of complex multi-criteria problems. On the other hand, the wide adoption of IT has enabled access to large quantities of information which has resulted in strengthening the significance of MCDM. These methods have become increasingly important as potential analytic tools for complex real-world problems because of their natural capacity to assess various elements in terms of multiple criteria (Xu & Yang, 2001). Therefore, MCDM could become widely adopted in local development modeling.====Multiple Criteria Decision Making methods are suitable for complex problems which are characterized by uncertainty and often include conflicting objectives and different data and information types in complex, evolving socio-economic and biophysical systems (Wang, Jing, Zhang, & Zhao, 2009, San Cristóbal Mateo, 2012). Generally, there are two groups of MCDM==== : ==== (MADM) and ==== (MODM) (Pourjavad & Shirouyehzad, 2011). The first one includes a finite number of alternatives. In MODM, the number of alternatives is infinite (see Pedrycz et al., 2011). Usually, problems related to the selection and assessment of alternative solutions are finite. In turn, as regards development-related problems, the decisive attribute==== may take any value from a specific interval. Therefore, the number of potential alternative solutions may be infinite (Xu & Yang, 2001).====Many various MCDM methods exist, including the most popular, as follows: the ==== (TOPSIS), the ==== (AHP), ==== (VIKOR), the Weighted Sum Method (WSM), ==== (ELECTRE), the ==== (PROMETHEE). Reviews of MCDM methods and their applications were conducted by Huang, Keisler, and Linkov (2011); Velasquez and Hester (2013); Zavadskas, Turskis, and Kildienė (2014); Mardani et al. (2015a); Mardani, Jusoh, & Zavadskas (2015) and Kolios, Mytilinou, Lozano-Minguez, and Salonitis (2016). Each of the multiple-criteria decision support methods features specific advantages, disadvantages and limitations.====Some methods were criticized because of their ad-hoc approach which cannot be fully justified on theoretical or empirical grounds (Stewart, 1992; Xu & Yang, 2001). Each of them offers some advantages while also having some limitations. However, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) may be regarded as one of the most interesting ones.",A model to assess the development priorities of local administrations through the hierarchy of strategic factors,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820301150,17 November 2020,2020,Research Article,163.0

We present real-time evidence on the effects of the coronavirus crisis on regional employment in Italy, by finding that the current shock is producing major adverse consequences in the South and on female occupation. We document that both the absorption and the allocation of the EU funds can sustain the resilience of ","Less than a decade after the end of the Great Recession, the Covid-19 pandemic that has started at the beginning of 2020 is posing economic and social challenges to policymakers worldwide. Apart from the severe implications on the health care systems, the sudden combination of demand and supply shocks caused by the coronavirus crisis is expected to affect the global economy substantially: a drop in the world gross domestic product (GDP) of about 5% is estimated this year with a partial rebound in 2021 (IMF, 2020), with differences across and within countries. In the European Union (EU), where the contraction of GDP will be about −9% this year (EU Commission, 2020a), supporting firms and households that are more vulnerable to shocks and sustaining the recovery are priorities in the near future. This is particularly true in the member states such as Italy, one of the countries that was hit the hardest by the first wave of the pandemic crisis. Moreover, in this country the regional impact of the current recession is highly heterogeneous due to territorial differences in the pandemic diffusion, and the long-lasting economic and social divide between the North and the South.====Despite the presence of uncertainty about the future development of the health emergency, the policy responses adopted by different governments and central banks have been effective at smoothing the adverse effects of the crisis to date (De Grauwe & Ji, 2020). Between March and April 2020, the EU Commission adopted the Corona Response Investment Initiative (CRII) and the Corona Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+) that firstly helped member states to cope with the health and economic emergency, by the reallocation of 55 billion euro of the cohesion funds. In July 2020, the EU approved the Next Generation package that will provide additional financial support to the member states for a total amount of 750 billion euro. In Italy, the EU Commission has redirected 30 million euro to help Emilia Romagna and Tuscany to cope with the health and economic shock. To protect jobs and create a resilient economy in the long-run, ‘members states need to boost absorption capacities of EU funds at national level to have an impact on investment decisions’ (EU Commission, 2020a). Therefore, there is need of evidence on how, and under which conditions, the EU funds can sustain resilience during downturns and support recovery (Camagni & Capello, 2017).====Thus, the main objective of this paper is to produce a set of empirics on the possible effects of the EU cohesion policy for supporting the Italian regional labour markets at time of Covid-19. In particular, we apply the employment elasticity of the effects of the EU cohesion policy calculated for the Great Recession to construct different scenarios of regional employment adjustments during the Covid-19 shock. Studying the effects of the cohesion policy on the Italian regional labour markets during the years of the Great Recession, when the EU programming period 2007–13 coincided with the harsh crisis, can be informative also for the current recession. Indeed, the short-term recalibration of the cohesion policy operated to cope with the Covid-19 shock has followed the modifications introduced during the Great Recession: a rise of the EU co-financing rates that covered up to 100% of total expenditures; an increase of financial resources to support innovation and protect jobs; a simplification of the administrative procedures with more flexible allocation of funds (EU Commission, 2020b). Moreover, the coronavirus downturn shares some similarities with the financial crisis, particularly regarding the drop in producer and consumer sentiments, the uncertain economic conditions, and the zero lower bound regime (Foroni, Marcellino, & Stevanovic, 2020). This gives us the possibility of using information on the previous crisis for making some analyses that can be useful at time of Covid-19. Further details on our approach are in Section 4.====Our work has the following additional goals. We map the distribution of the effects of the current crisis across Italy, by applying resilience indexes (Di Caro, 2015) to the last available data on regional employment. This is useful to document where and to which extent the pandemic crisis is producing the most relevant adverse effects on regional labour markets, and from a policy perspective, to identify the places that request more assistance to recover (Clemens & Veuger, 2020). In addition, we look at two specific factors, the quality of regional institutions and the adoption of national regulatory changes, which can explain the positive effects of the EU funds on the resilience of regional labour markets during shocks. Both objectives aim at supporting policymakers on how and where addressing the cohesion funds and, most importantly, on which factors can contribute to improve the effectiveness of such policy at time of Covid-19.====Our empirics suggest that the major negative impacts of the first months of the Covid-19 crisis on regional labour markets are localised in the Southern regions, by confirming the vulnerability of this area to unexpected shocks (Baussola & Fiorito, 1994). The results also confirm the low resilience of female occupations in Italy during crises; and, that employment losses due to the coronavirus shock are distributed more homogenously across Italy compared to the Great Recession. We find that the employment losses registered during the Covid-19 shock, about 840,000 less occupations between 2020Q2 and 2019Q2, can be potentially limited if more EU funds are timely transferred to beneficiaries. Specifically, we document that a rise of 10% of cohesion payments over committed funds (i.e. absorption rate) combined with an increase of the EU funds allocated to regions of 1% can reduce employment losses on annual basis by about 14%–27%. The upper limit is registered when including the effects of national policy changes, such as the ==== introduced in Italy in 2011.==== This means that the cohesion policy can contribute to save from 120,000 to 230,000 occupations in the next year if properly managed. Such effects are probably lower bounds, given that we only consider cohesion funds allocated by means of Regional Operational Programs (ROPs) and we do not include projects for infrastructures in our analysis.====In the next Section, we discuss how this work builds on and contributes to three main research areas: the analyses on the economic effects of Covid-19; cohesion policy studies; and, the resilience literature.

In this paper we consider how these two objectives are linked through increases in cultural output. We use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Chinese economy to analyse the impact of cultural investment on the output of cultural goods and services between 2009 and 2015, and we carry forward the simulations to 2030. Our results show that this cultural policy instrument has had a positive impact on the output of cultural goods and services in a manner that also underpins the purely cultural objectives of government.","Cultural policy has emerged in recent years as an important area for policy attention in most countries, not least in China. Notwithstanding the complex relationships between culture, the economy and society in China, the government’s cultural policy can be expressed in simple terms as having two primary objectives. The first recognises the fundamental role of culture in Chinese society and the importance of the long traditions of art and culture at the heart of Chinese identity. Public expenditure in this context includes measures such as the preservation and conservation of cultural heritage, support for museums and art galleries, provision of community cultural services, and development of cultural tourism. It also extends to the international arena via cultural diplomacy and the exercise of soft power in promoting Chinese art and culture abroad. The second objective involves an explicit recognition of the economic importance of the cultural industries, defined as those industries producing cultural goods and services such as films, visual art, music, theatre, and other products. Such commodities are important from a policy viewpoint because their production contributes significantly to GDP, value added, employment and exports.====The two objectives are not unrelated, since increased output of artistic and cultural products in pursuit of the second objective is likely to contribute to the first via expanding the population’s access to cultural experiences, thereby reinforcing the role of artistic and cultural consumption in building social wellbeing, and fostering an appreciation of the importance of art and culture in community life. These considerations point to a potentially important policy question. To what extent are these objectives in fact interrelated? Can government financing in support of the cultural industries lead to improvement in these industries’ economic development and in so doing make a presumptive contribution to the purely cultural goals of Chinese public policy? If so, a more specific question arises: given the array of instruments available in the Chinese government’s cultural policy armoury, what measures will be effective in contributing directly to such improvements? In particular, in view of the importance of public investment as an avenue for intervention in many sectors of the Chinese economy, can investment in the cultural industries have these desirable impacts?====In this paper we address these questions by investigating the extent to which a Chinese government policy of investment in the cultural industries can in fact promote the economic performance of these industries in a manner consistent with broader cultural policy goals. We do so through the specification and estimation of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Chinese economy, which allows us to simulate both the past impact of cultural investment and the potential future impact of such investment on the output of cultural goods and services. The results will allow us to draw out the policy implications of using a cultural investment strategy as an avenue towards the achievement of both the cultural and economic objectives of Chinese cultural policy.====The paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we discuss the evolution of cultural policy in China and its orientation towards the above twin objectives. The increasing emphasis on the economic content of cultural policy in China over the last two decades is noted in comparison with similar trends in many Western countries during the same period. Then in section 3 we focus on the cultural industries as the specific sector of the economy where production of artistic and cultural goods and services occurs and where governments can intervene to affect outcomes. The policy problem with which we are concerned is the extent to which such intervention can be successful in the Chinese context in improving cultural policy delivery. In section 4 we propose an analytical method involving simulation of cultural sector dynamics to examine the impact of one particular policy measure, cultural investment, on the output of the cultural industries in the economy of China. Our empirical study presented in section 6 and 7 assesses the relevant impacts both historically for the period since 2008 and prospectively over the next decade, allowing us to draw some conclusions about the wider usefulness of this policy instrument.

Considering that such policy changes influence both in-house research and development investments and technology licensing from external sources, the firms have to accordingly devise their technology strategy. This study employs a simple and fixed effects multinomial logit regression models to study the impact of policy changes on the technology strategy of 402 firms operating in Indian manufacturing sector from 1999 to 2014. The results show that changes in patent policy have a significant impact on technology strategy of firms.","Patent policy is a significant tool of appropriability conditions that provides rights to innovators that direct markets forces into technological advances driving the technology-lead economic growth (Teece, 1986). The appropriability conditions include the levels and means of possibilities of protecting innovation from imitation to reap profits from such activities (Malerba & Orsenigo, 1990, 1993). Such conditions influence firm’s behavior in terms of basic technology strategies and organizational choices (Marlerba & Orsenigo, 1993).====Technology strategies gain paramount focus of firms as in the global market they face the challenges as well opportunities in terms of new markets and technologies. Further, the uncertainty due to rapidly changing products with shorter life cycles makes firms innovate regularly for survival. For firms located in developing countries that may be followers of the technology leaders at global level there is a potential to optimally integrate external knowledge with its’ indigenous efforts. The technology strategy of such firms that may include the organization of innovation along the internal versus external sourcing dimension is a complex issue (Veugelers & Cassiman, 1999). R&D and technology acquisition from external sources by means of capital purchase, exports and licensing are ways to access new products and/or processes (Hou & Mohnen, 2013). Interestingly, these options are not mutually exclusive and firms may combine different alternatives for its technological progress. For instance, the indigenous technological efforts of a firm can be based on the adaptation of foreign technology, applied due to difference in scale of production, raw materials, intermediate inputs, factor costs, income level etc. in comparison to developed economies. It is expected that an efficient choice of an option is the outcome of the successful technology strategy of a firm. The theoretical literature draws on transaction costs economics and property rights to consider the choice of firms between external sourcing and internal development as substitutes: the make or buy decision (Arrow, 1962; Coase, 1937). Further, a significant literature supports the complementarity between in-house R&D and external know-how as only because of internal R&D capabilities firms can effectively ‘absorb’ external knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1989). Radnor (1991) also identifies the difficulty of being a good ‘buyer’ when one is not also a ‘maker’.====Appropriability conditions along with the opportunity, cumulativeness and complexity of knowledge define the overall technological regime in an economy that has a significant influence on the innovation by firms (Nelson & Winter, 1982; Winter, 1984). The changes in the technological regime (exogenous and/or endogenous) are expected to influence the technology related choices made by firms. Thus, for policymakers who give considerable importance to creating a supportive technological regime for innovation activities of scientists and firms the impact evaluation of policy changes is of utmost significance. India as a founding member of WTO has made changes in the patent policy to comply with the Agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs). The ensuing changes in the patent policy have increased the rights of the patent owners and are expected to increase R&D and technology transfer. A firm under new regime can either choose to conduct more R&D or license and/or perform both to increase its innovative activity. Particularly, in the context of developing economies, which have access to external technology through licensing it, it remains to be empirically verified if the changes of patent policy or the appropriability regime favor a particular option. We propose to address this issue in the context of Indian manufacturing sector. Specifically, this study uses firm level data to empirically investigate the impact of patent policy changes on technology strategy of firms from 1999 to 2014 of 402 medium and high technology Indian manufacturing firms. The result shows that changes in patent policy have a significant impact on the technology strategy of firms. The results also exhibit that in-house R&D expenditure and licensing are the complementary strategies for the Indian manufacturing firms. The issue gains policy relevance, as the strategy adopted by a firm, influences the capabilities it develops over a period of time, leading to a firm being either a technology follower or forerunner.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next section sets the background by reviewing the existing literature on technology strategy and regime by providing evidences on R&D and licensing and the evolution of patent policy in India.

The catastrophic impact of the pandemic gives it the power to change the policy frame of countries forever. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to weigh higher on a developing country (====) because of the poor health infrastructure and surplus demand. While the governments and the health personnel have been on their toes to curb the spread of COVID-19, the researchers have come up with several predictive epidemiological models to predict the estimated rise in the number of infected cases. These models aid policy makers to understand the severity of these diseases and plan the mitigation strategies accordingly.====The SIR model given by ==== is one of the most popular epidemiological models used by scientists and researchers to study the spread of contagious diseases. Researchers have previously used the SIR model and its extensions to estimate the parameters of diseases. ==== used the SEIR model to estimate the contact rate of chickenpox in France. ==== studied the dynamics of measles epidemics using a time series SIR model. ==== use a fractional SEIR epidemic model to analyze the disease-free state when the death rate is proportional to the population density. ====; ====; ====; ====, and ==== focus on estimating the basic reproduction number R====. R==== is defined as the average number of infections that an infected person can cause after getting into contact with the susceptible population (====).====Another area in the related stream analyzes the impact of different initiatives and policy measures to limit the spread of the disease. ==== consider the feasibility and impact of a set of suppression and mitigation measures on controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Great Britain and the US context. ==== present an optimal lockdown policy in terms of the duration and strictness of lockdown measures with the objectives of minimizing the number of fatalities and lockdown costs. South Korea and Hong Kong have successfully limited the number of confirmed cases by leveraging civil society for pandemic management (====; ====). Further, South Korea flattened the curve by combining testing, early isolation, and free treatment of positive cases with digital technologies without resorting to ‘lockdown'. It also disclosed all information on COVID-19 to the public in an open and transparent manner. In fact, South Korea’s response is considered as one of the most effective models against COVID-19 (====). China, too used citizen volunteers to work with the government to protect public health and to augment public services (====). Several countries in Africa have either deployed or are considering using digital contact-tracing (DCT) to leverage unique institutional and technological characteristics and learnings from previous pandemics like Ebola (====). Overall, numerous modeling efforts forecast the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. While informative, these efforts have been generally limited to specific nations and snapshots in time.====Closer to our work, another stream of literature examines the impact of policy-related control measures on economic cost and the spread of COVID-19. ==== and ==== use the SIR model to predict the spread of COVID-19 in the United States by varying the level of mitigation measures from mild to severe. ==== extend the standard SIR model by including multiple demographic-based risk groups. They quantitatively investigate the optimal policy by analyzing the trade-off between efforts needed to save lives and improve economic indicators. ==== introduce a simulation tool, Flu And Coronavirus Simulator (FACS), that models the viral spread at the sub-national level, incorporating geospatial data sources to extract buildings and residential areas in a region. Using FACS, they model COVID-19 spread at the local level and provide estimates of the spread of infections and hospital arrivals for different scenarios. ==== assess the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 by using three uncertainty measures. In the Indian context, ==== proposed a support vector regression model with Radial Basis Function as the kernel to predict the total number of deaths, recovered cases, the cumulative number of confirmed cases, and number of daily cases. However, their model predictions were made until June 2020.

The results provide evidence that enhancing the informal sector's access to capital and mitigating liquidity constraints through public transfers for informal households lead mainly to negative spillovers on the informal and formal sectors, on the salaried workers’ incomes as well as the GDP.====The informal sector==== in Africa has been considered for a long time as a range of marginal activities doomed to disappear with an improving economic development (Schneider & Enste, 2000). But during this last decade, the informal sector placed itself as a potential source of incomes by providing after the agricultural sector the most number of jobs. In fact, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) the informal sector represents 42% of the GDP and occupies about 70% of the non-farming workforce of Sub-Saharan countries.==== In Burkina Faso, the informal economy employs 74% of the non-farming workforce and contributes to about 25% of the GDP (National Office of Statistics of Burkina).====However, the main actors of the informal sector are paradoxically among the most precarious and vulnerable. In fact, most of the informal actors are deprived from social protection, faced with weak skills and credit constraints which undermine their productivity (Benjamin, Mbaye, & Diop, 2012; Traoré, 2013). Furthermore, relatively low levels of women's education and social norms often limit women to unpaid domestic cleaning work and small income-generating activities at home or on streets from which they derive the most precarious incomes (Chen, 2001; Kuepie, Nordman, & Roubaud, 2009; Traoré, 2013). So the informal sector is a concern for Governments of Africa interested in alleviating poverty and inequities.====Despite its magnitude the informal sector contributes very weakly to the domestic direct tax revenues. According to a recent study carried out in the Francophone West African countries, the informal activities provide only 3% of the national direct tax effort (Benjamin et al., 2012). Therefore, promoting informal activities to raise their productivity by facilitating their formalization represents an opportunity for Governments to broaden tax base necessary to mobilize more domestic resources for development outcomes.====Another relevant issue related to the informal sector is found in its tendency to threaten the structural transformation of African countries. Indeed, resources have often moved from higher to lower productivity sectors, particularly to the informal sector, reversing structural transformation and slowing productivity growth in Africa (ECA & AUC, 2014)==== However, ECA and AUC (2015) highlighted the large involment of the informal sector in trade and services – identified as engines of structural transformation- and stressed the need of appropriate policies to harness the potential of the informal sector in Africa by expanding social protection systems, fiscal and credit incentives, skill development programmes, technology transfer and infrastructure investment.====In line with these recommendations, many African countries (Senegal, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, etc.) have been implementing a range of policies to enhance the productivity of the informal sector. In Burkina Faso, the Government established public structures since 1998 to support the informal firms at technical and financial levels. These structures provide vocational trainings to improve managerial abilities and credit at low rates along with cash transfers, in order to mitigate capital and liquidity constraints.====However, some studies provided evidence that subsidized credit or vocational trainings to improve the informal sector productivity could be inefficient or harmful for the informal sector itself, for the formal sector, the agricultural sector as well as the economic growth subject to some conditions (Alia, Ndjana, & Nghogue, 2009; Arvin-Rad, Basu, & Willumsen, 2010; Banerji & Jain, 2007; Roy, 2006). These conditions pertain mainly to the linkages between the informal and formal sectors, such as competition or cooperation, imperfect substitution between the informal-based products and formal-based products and the saturation of market.====So it is important to know in the context of Burkina Faso: what is the impact of the policies enhancing the access to capital and liquidity for the informal sector on itself, on the formal sector and the agricultural sector? Have these policies induced positive spillovers on incomes, jobs and economic growth? In Burkina Faso, most of studies have addressed the determinants and structure of the informal sector, its linkages with the formal sector and the barriers to formalization (Böhme & Thiele, 2014; Grimm, Knorringa, & Lay, 2012; Ouédraogo et al., 2011; Ouédraogo, 1996; Traoré, 2013). However research to evaluate the effects of policies supporting the informal sector is almost non-existent. Therefore, the added value of this research is to fill this gap in order to enlighten the policy makers.====Several econometric analyses, for instance, propensity-score matching and randomization have been used to evaluate the impact of micro-lending and vocational training programmes serving the informal enterprises on earnings, employment, and inequalities in the context of Africa, in particular (Glaub & Frese, 2011; Mano, Iddrisu, Yoshino, & Sonobe, 2012; Roubaud & Gubert, 2011). These studies in general found positive effects (often limited) of such programmes on earnings and employment within the informal sector along with a reducing inequality. But the main limit of the microeconomic analyses is found in their failure to capture the indirect effects on the formal and agricultural sectors as well as on economic growth. Given the strong informal-formal linkages which could reverse the benefits of the scaling-up programmes, a CGE model is well suited to highlight the transmission channels and capture the indirect effects.====In fact, this approach has been used by recent research addressing the informal economy. For instance, Erero, Pambudi and Bonga-Bonga (2014) used a multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model adapted to the economy of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to analyze the effects of reducing tariffs and wage subsidies for lower-skilled formal workers. Davies and Thurlow (2011) also used a CGE model included the economy wide linkages between the formal and informal economies, to address the effects of trade liberalization in South Africa.====However, recent studies using a CGE model to analyze the effects of a policy shock on the informal sector are scarce, especially in the African context. Indeed, one of the most recent one is the study by Alia et al. (2009) which assessed the impact of the increase in the informal households’ investment under the programme “Integrated Support Programme for Actors of the Informal Sector” in Cameroon. However, in their model the value added of the sectors (formal and informal) are combinations of capital and labour according to a Cobb Douglas function which constrained the value of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour to 1. The capital is sectoral specific and only two categories of labour (formal and informal) are considered so ignoring the quality aspect of labour.====Our model is more flexible and realistic because all the sectors (informal, formal and agricultural) combine unskilled labour, skilled labour and capital through a CES production technology. Moreover, the households are assumed to have a Stone-Geary utility function which includes a minimum level of consumption for each commodity and avoid zero cross-price elasticities between all pairs of goods, and a unit income-elasticity for all goods. Policy experiments deal with a 10% in the demand for productive capital in the informal sector and a 10% increase in the Government's transfers to the informal households.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a relevant literature review. Section 3 addresses the main points of the CGE model whereas the following section presents the SAM-2008 used in our empirical analysis. Section 5 summarizes the motivations of the policy experiments and Section 6 presents the results along with the related discussion. The last section concludes with policy recommendations.","Public policies promoting the informal sector: Effects on incomes, employment and growth in Burkina Faso",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820301058,17 October 2020,2020,Research Article,168.0

By well-behaved we mean that policy or short-term interbank interest rates are transmitted arbitrage-free to market-determined, longer-term bond yields. The transmission mechanism appears to be functional and largely identical in all sample countries, including low-income ones, suggesting that the importance of developed secondary markets for monetary transmission may be overstated. We find, however, that in countries with anchored inflation expectations the propagation of policy innovations is mostly through short-end changes of the yield curve, that is, through the slope shift, while in the rest of the sample it is mostly through the level shift.====After the financial crises of the 1990s and 2000s, emerging market and low-income country central banks began reviewing their monetary frameworks to make policy more forward-looking. These banks have felt uncertain about how monetary policy would transmit to longer-term rates and, eventually, to output and prices, given sometimes rudimentary status of domestic financial markets. The task of identifying the transmission mechanism has been challenging in the environment of short, noisy time series plagued by policy-driven structural breaks and supply shocks. At the policy level, there has been little agreement on the efficiency of monetary transmission in low-income countries (IMF, 2015).====The evidence based on VAR models has been mixed. Some studies, relying on reduced-form analysis have claimed that the transmission mechanism remains weak (Davoodi, Dixit, & Pinter, 2013; Mishra, Montiel, & Spilimbergo, 2012). Others found evidence of more robust transmission ([Anwar and Nguyen, 2018], [Primus, 2018]). Christiano, Eichenbaumand, and Evans (1999) documented theoretical and empirical difficulties in estimating the effects of monetary policy in the VARs of advanced countries with a well-defined business cycle. Berg, Charry, Portillo, and Vlcek (2013) argued that analyses based on VARs – requiring long time series without policy breaks – are unlikely to provide statistically significant results in low-income countries and instead used the narrative approach of Romer and Romer (1994) to identify textbook transmission effects to output and prices.====Our approach is less ambitious in the sense that we focus only on the first part of the monetary transmission mechanism. Monetary policy actions instantly move short-term market interest rates, either by directly using a short-term rate as the policy instrument or by changing money market rates indirectly by setting money growth targets and managing liquidity in line with these targets. A policy-induced increase in the short-term nominal interest rate then leads to an increase in longer-term nominal interest rates in line with the term structure of interest rates as investors arbitrage away differences in risk-adjusted expected returns on debt instruments of various maturities (Fig. 1) (Karagiannis, Panagopoulos, & Vlamis, 2010).====We explore the transmission from the short-term rate or policy rate to long-term bond yields, identifying the three latent factors commonly used to describe the dynamics of the yield curve – the level, slope, and curvature.==== The workhorse of our analysis is the model by Christensen et al. (2011), or CDR, an arbitrage-free representation of the Nelson-Siegel yield curve model. As a robustness check, available on request, we use the principal component analysis by Litterman and Scheinkman (1991), or LS, see also Cortés, Fernando, Capistrán, Ramos-Francia, and García (2009). The latent factors explain most of the yield curve variability and we inspect their role in the propagation of monetary policy innovations.====Passthrough from policy innovations into the factors depends on whether inflation expectations are anchored or not (Mishkin, 1995). In countries where inflation expectations are anchored, one would expect monetary policy innovations to be propagated primarily through changes in the slope factor. Agents believe that the innovations are designed so as to return the rate of inflation to the target at the end of the two-to-three-year monetary transmission period and, hence, policy tightening and loosening are seen as both credible and relatively short-lived events. Consequently, there is little need to adjust the long-run interest rates and most of the action along the yield curve is happening through a flattening of its slope (see the full and dashed lines for the initial and new yield curves, respectively, in Fig. 2).====In countries where either inflation expectations are linked to past inflation or actual inflation is volatile, agents know neither the true inflation objective nor the policy horizon, and the return of inflation to the target may be protracted. The agents tend to see policy innovations as relatively long-lasting events and the long-run rates move as well, with much of the propagation happening through a vertical shift of the yield curve (the dotted line in Fig. 2). While this propagation mechanism is presumably less efficient in business cycle stabilization than the one operating through the slope change, it is still a functioning monetary transmission mechanism.====Our approach is a viable alternative to the VAR and other approaches in assessing the interest rate channel. Our results are robust to coefficient changes in the CDR methodology and they are corroborated by the LS methodology. Similar to other approaches, the robustness of our findings is constrained by short and noisy yield data and structural breaks in the emerging market and low income countries.====In the remainder of the paper we proceed as follows. First, we outline the modeling techniques used to derive the three factors. Second, we describe our sample and discuss the various empirical trade-offs. Third, we present our results and sketch policy implications.

The sharp fluctuations in these markets, especially those caused by the severe sanctions imposed on Iran in May 2018, and the pandemic outbreak of Covid-19 have led to more confusion and uncertainty among investors. One of the effective approaches to examine such unstable conditions is to study the co-movement(s) between markets to identify the leading variable(s). Thus, in the present study, Wavelet Coherence Analysis was applied to examine the co-movements between markets in a time period from September 2014 to June 2020, as an intense period of uncertainty in Iran. In other words, in this study, the markets were investigated in different sub-periods. Also, the Segmented Regression was performed to estimate the impact of sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic on the co-movements of financial markets in Iran.====The results showed that the oil price had a low co-movement with the other three markets, i.e. stock exchange, exchange rate, and gold markets. Thus, the oil market can be a suitable alternative for risk aversion investors. Meanwhile, the oil market could also act as a source of ","Financial markets in a closed economy, such as that of Iran, experience different conditions compared to the world’s major financial markets. Iran has been under constant economic pressure due to various economic sanctions since 1980 and thereafter has experienced continued economic policy shifts, especially in the area of financial market policy. All of these factors have led to a shallow capital market, resulting in a situation where the financial markets, particularly the stock market, do not have a logical relationship with the other sectors of the economy and the rest of the world financial markets.====, rampant unemployment, deepening recession, and the increasing devaluation of the national currency clearly show the fragile state of the economy.====The increasing and unprecedented devaluation of Iran’s national currency and the absence of a coherent policy to preserve the value of people’s assets have led people to engage in unproductive activities, such as buying and selling currency, gold, and land. In an effort to discourage people from doing such activities, the Iranian economic policymakers encouraged people to invest in the stock market. Although this policy was first implemented during Ahmadinejad’s presidency in the form of granting ‘shares of justice’ to the public, the Rouhani’s government, following the tightening of sanctions preventing Iran from selling oil on international markets, has introduced a wave of policies to support markets, including the stock market, energy market, and, to some extent, gold market, as to reduce liquidity. This has caused people to invest in financial markets, especially the stock market, to maintain the value of their assets. Currently, more than 60% of Iranians (near 50 million people) are active in the Tehran Stock Exchange.====Iran’s domestic financial markets include the stock market, gold market, and the ==== (mainly US dollars). Another financial market that has been introduced in Iran since 2012 is the Energy Exchange market. In this market, it is possible to sell both physical oil and oil derivatives. All these four markets are always influenced by factors such as political news, economic sanctions, and the policies adopted by the Iranian government and central bank.====Another important point is that the measures introduced by policy-makers in Iran during economic crises have contributed to fluctuations in these markets, leaving investors in great confusion. Covid-19 pandemic is one of the most important recent events that has had a direct impact on economies around the world. With the growing spread of this pandemic and the increase in the number of cases, its negative effects on the world economy are gradually becoming more apparent. In this regard, ==== found a significant relationship between the number of patients with Covid-19 and the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index and the New York Dow Jones.====Now, the question that begs to be answered is whether the financial markets in Iran can be a safer place to invest than other markets and whether they can attract investors. This issue has attracted more attention since the economic sanctions were tightened in 2018, forcing individuals to look for a suitable market to maintain the value of their assets. In addition, Covid-19 pandemic has made the situation more difficult for investors.====Investors can avoid huge losses by diversifying their portfolios. Diversification should not be done with assets that have similar moves because the accumulation of these assets can make a profit or loss (====). An understanding of the co-movement of financial markets can provide investors with a great deal of information to be able to determine the optimal investment portfolio (====).====An important point is that the co-movements between financial markets do not always happen in the same way. In other words, two markets that may move together at the present may move in opposite directions later. Therefore, it would be essential for all investors to have an accurate prediction of the movements of markets toward and against each other. Indeed, a stable and safe market, in which less movement takes place in comparison to other markets, can be a financially safe choice for an investor, especially in the event of unanticipated and sudden shocks in the economy. Therefore, studying financial markets and encouraging investors to have a lower-risk portfolio have become particularly important in the current context of the Iranian economy. The main question is how policymakers can help investors in the Iranian financial markets in these exceptionally difficult circumstances.====Investigating the co-movement of financial markets with each other can partially answer this question. In fact, understanding that co-movement is valuable for investors, policy makers and portfolio managers (====). Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to examine the co-movements between four financial markets, i.e. the stock, oil, foreign exchange, and gold markets, in the Iranian economy from September 29, 2014 to June 4, 2020. This period was divided into four critical sub-periods: The pre-Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) period, the post-JCPOA period, the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA and the return of sanctions, and finally the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.====In this study, we used Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) to determine, first, how markets interacted with each other in the short-, medium-, and long-term periods and, secondly, which market was the leading market. Understanding the co-movements between different markets (variables) is important, but it is equally important to examine the impact of other factors, such as sanctions and a pandemic outbreak, on these co-movements. Accordingly, after calculating the co-movements of each pair of variables, the impacts of the imposition of new sanctions in 2018 and the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak on the co-movements of variables in the financial markets of Iran were investigated using segmented regression.====There are a few studies that have used WCA to study the co-movement of financial markets (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In Iran, only two studies have investigated this topic (====; ====). The present study differs from the existing studies in the following three ways. First, the interaction between the energy exchange market and other assets in Iran, as a developing country, was studied, which was not done in any of the previous studies related to Iran. Secondly, the movements of financial markets were examined separately for different sub-periods (time scales). Thirdly, the impact of sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic on these co-movements were examined as well. These two factors have not been studied in any of the available studies in the literature.====By showing the beginning of the movement of a market, the results of the present study can help both investors and policy-makers predict which markets will co-move in different time periods and in what direction and whether their co-movement will affect a third market. The policy-makers can also use this analysis to determine which market is causing the fluctuations observed in another market and what can be done to stabilize the second market. These two latter points are important because, in order to reduce liquidity, inflation, and the budget deficit, investors should move towards the markets which are safer for investment.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The second section provides some factual information about financial markets in Iran. In the third section, the related literature is reviewed. The fourth section is devoted to the research methodology. Empirical results and discussion are presented in Section ====. The last section offers some concluding remarks.","The cross-impact between financial markets, Covid-19 pandemic, and economic sanctions: The case of Iran",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820301009,24 September 2020,2020,Research Article,170.0

Even though the available literature is still far from reaching a consensus, theoretically Aghion, Angeletos, Banrjee, and Manova (2010) and empirically Ramey and Ramey (1995) provided credible evidence that high levels of output volatility pose a significant risk on a country’s long-run output growth. Hence, mitigating output volatility is a challenging priority especially for the countries that exposure to economic fluctuations. However, how to do this and/or whether can they be offset through fiscal policy is a highly controversial issue in the existing literature, despite the fact that stabilizing economic fluctuations, in a broader perspective, is one of the three basic Musgravian objectives―macroeconomic stabilization, re-distribution of income, and re-allocation of resources―assigned to fiscal policy.====No doubt, the 2008/09 global crisis hit many countries across the world. The case of EMU member states==== was not exceptional from this. But the crisis hit some EMU member states countries more than the others. The crisis experiences of the EMU member states, in conjunction with the others, have rekindled discussions about how to stabilize output volatility that the countries face.====The key point of the discussions has been that whether fiscal policy shortens the amplitude of output fluctuations, especially in times when monetary policy cannot fulfill its task properly or its task disappears as in the case of the recent global crisis. In an economic environment in which monetary policy cannot fulfill its functions properly, fiscal policy in general, automatic stabilizers==== in particular, has received a renewed interest and centered on the discussions. Much different from the past, the post-EMU process has upgraded the role of fiscal policy as a macroeconomic policy tool in smoothing-out output shocks, especially demand-induced ones. Besides, in an economic and monetary union like the EMU in which members are most likely to encounter asymmetric shocks, the single monetary policy may not be sufficiently effective in absorbing shocks. Intrinsically, this assigns further responsibilities to fiscal policy in the EMU member states. However, the fiscal rules related to budget deficits and government debt adopted by the Maastricht Treaty and Stability and Growth Pact restrict the room for national discretionary fiscal policies. In such a case, the sole fiscal-policy device from which member states utilize is the automatic stabilizers. This comes to mean that the pact forces implicitly the member states to consider only the automatic stabilizers in their stabilization efforts. As is known, automatic stabilizers are the cyclically induced changes in taxes and government expenditures, which tend to dampen upward and downward swings in output (Veld, Larch, & Vandeweyer, 2013). They are self-acting fiscal instruments that cannot be controlled by policymakers, at least in the short run, but changing over the economic cycle. They automatically counteract the economic cycle and therefore have the potential of absorbing asymmetric shocks to output.====Increasing worry about the effectiveness of discretionary fiscal policy that is frequently associated with the inside lag problem has led to the emerging of increasing attention to the non-discretionary fiscal policy; that is, automatic stabilizers. One of the major superiority of automatic stabilizers over discretionary fiscal policy is their inside lag is to be zero. Perhaps due to this reality, what we see from the existing literature is that automatic stabilizers have received growing academic attention throughout the past decade as they had never before. Despite there has been no consensus over its effectiveness and strength, so much so that it has been even argued in the era of the post–2008/09 global crisis that discretionary fiscal policy should leave its place to the automatic stabilizers.====Against this backdrop, several questions bear in one’s mind as such that in times when the room for monetary maneuvering is limited by interest rates which close to their zero lower bound, or when countries deliberately abandon independent monetary policies to join a currency union or adopt a fixed exchange rate, can fiscal policy be a unique tool for macroeconomic policy family to provide and maintain output stabilization? or how fluctuations in economic activity can be smoothed-out through the government’s fiscal-policy actions in the face of an ineffective monetary policy resulted from, say, extremely low or even negative interest rates? As part of the best macroeconomic policy implementations, simultaneously using fiscal and monetary policy in fighting downturns has become the focal point of discussions in the post-crisis period, albeit ineffectiveness of monetary policy alone. Related to fiscal policy, however, some other questions have also arisen in one’s mind: is there any credible role for discretionary and/or non-discretionary fiscal policy? If so, what are their appropriate roles? Which part of fiscal policy, discretionary vs. non-discretionary, is more effective in smoothing-out output volatility? Do automatic stabilizers properly fulfill their function? Are they sufficiently enough in mitigating output volatility in bad times? Do governments need discretionary fiscal action apart from automatic stabilizers?====This paper seeks to examine empirically the output-volatility reducing impact of automatic stabilizers in nine EMU countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) over the period 1995–2017. Put differently, the present paper endeavors to find an answer to the question of how the automatic stabilizers are effective in offsetting output volatility. Needless to say, whole member states are subject to a centralized monetary policy, but not a discretionary fiscal policy, since they adhere to the common economic policies of the EMU like other members. Nevertheless, we know that discretionary fiscal policymaking is somewhat restricted by the EMU through fiscal rules that were set out in the Maastricht criteria and then the Stability and Convergence Programs. Even so, it is an open question of how much these rules constrain the misuse of discretionary fiscal policy by the member states. Under such circumstances, focusing on the automatic stabilizers and giving a further role to them in output stabilization by expanding their capability become crucially important for these states to get the maximum benefit from the fiscal policy in the broadest sense.====Thanks to the stability programs of the EMU, the goal set out in points to the importance of having a budgetary position of close to zero deficits or in surplus for the member states and thereby implicitly expresses that the member states should have a budgetary position of close to zero deficits or in surplus by which automatic stabilizers should play an active role in economic cycles as well as smooth-out it counter-cycle manner. This leaves plenty of room for us to study the output-volatility dampening effect of the automatic stabilizers in the EMU member states above. However, there has been no clear-cut answer yet on how much output stabilization is delivered by the automatic stabilizers remains a mystery for both researchers and policymakers. As highlighted by Fatás and Mihov (2012), despite the automatic stabilizers were widely seen as “doing their thing”, no one has questioned their role in reducing economic fluctuations till very recent decades.====This paper contributes to the existing literature over such connections in three main ways. First, most of the earlier empirical studies have concentrated on the linkage between automatic stabilizers and output volatility by using just one or two proxy measures—this is, either income tax or unemployment compensations, or both—for automatic stabilizers. Hence, it is obvious that by just considering one or two proxy measures, attempting to gauge the output-volatility reducing effect of automatic stabilizers may be neither satisfactory nor robust. Because the output-volatility reducing effect of automatic stabilizers may vary with how to measure automatic stabilizers. In this paper, therefore, we take the issue of automatic stabilizers from a broader perspective and then consider wide-ranging proxy measures of automatic stabilizers that are related to both revenue and expenditure sides of the government budget. Second, contrary to most available empirical studies, we incorporate reasonably comprehensive control variables as specific channels through which automatic stabilizers are likely to affect output volatility. The inclusion of such variables to our estimation model would make more sense because automatic stabilizers may not be powerful enough to mitigate the volatility of output per se. By doing so, we seek to investigate the output-volatility reducing impact of automatic stabilizers based on a more generalized model that allows us to avoid misspecification that may bias the results.====The present paper also differs from previous literature in terms of its econometric model specification. We chose the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimation technique developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999) to estimate dynamic heterogeneous panel models. To our knowledge, it has not been used in any similar study until now. The PMG estimation technique allows us to obtain reliable results and to get convincing outcomes on the relation between output volatility and automatic stabilizers by distinguishing between short- and long-run effects. The related literature acknowledges that using a dynamic econometric specification is beneficial because it matches up with the theoretical predictions well and provides alternative solutions for eliminating other models’ shortcomings. Then, more accurate results can be acquired by utilizing such econometric specifications and thus the results can be used for appropriate macroeconomic policy suggestions.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section first looks into theoretical arguments and then reviews the related literature on the effectiveness of automatic stabilizers. This is followed in Section 3 by the econometric analysis, while the econometric results and policy discussion are presented in Section 4.

For this reason, modeling the term structure of interest rates, based on the Expectations Hypothesis of Term Structure (EHTS here after), is viewed as crucial to determining the impact of monetary policies and the transmission mechanism, playing an important role in macroeconomic predictions and in portfolio analysis (Li & Davis, 2017) or stimulating economic activity (Igan, Kabundi, De Simone, & Tamirisa, 2017) and promoting higher earnings for the firms in the economy (Ioannidis & Kontonikas, 2008); thus, changes in short-term interest rates usually impact on long-term interest rates, and if this occurs, we can conclude that the monetary policy is effective (Holmes, Otero, & Panagiotidis, 2015). Moreover, the EHTS is accepted as a predictive instrument (Mankiw & Miron, 1986; Poole, Rasche, & Thornton, 2002 or Adrian & Estrella, 2008) or because it has deep implications for monetary policy (e.g., Weber and Wolters, 2012, Weber and Wolters, 2013). Indeed, when monetary policy is effective, changes in short-term policy interest rates should impact long-term ones. Furthermore, attending to the difference in the relationship between short and long-term interest rates with different maturities, i.e., the term spread or the slope of the yield curve, contain significant information on future changes in short-term rates. In this respect, the term spread is an important determinant of the predictive power of the current monetary policy, which is influenced in turn by current economic activity. So, the term spread includes expectations of future activity (Estrella, 2005). In fact and concerning this latter idea, Estrella and Hardouvelis, 1990, Estrella and Hardouvelis, 1991 evidenced that the yield curve may be used as a predictor of real growth in consumption, investment, and aggregate GNP, as well as NBER-dated recessions, i.e., this power to control is due to the term spread offering significant information regarding the effects of shocks in the long run. Thus, one can assume that the term spread is a leading indicator of growth and recessions. In this sense, the correct modelling of the term spread will be a key in as much as its degree of persistence would mark the considerations and the implications relative to the monetary policy and its subsequent impact to the economy. In this line, some authors expose that, depending on its integration degree, a long memory spread would offer adequate forecasting power at longer horizons (Baillie & Bollerslev, 1994) and, more importantly, this would have implications for the controllability of interest rates (see Cassola and Morana, 2010, Hassler and Nautz, 2008 or Cömert, 2012).====According to this idea, the treatment of both short- and long-term interest rates may permit us to compare the properties of these time series and the behaviour of the term spread as an term structure of interest rates control, jointly. Thus, this work revises recent US economic history (since 1870) in order to check how the major economic events impact on the macroeconomic time series, which may have intense and long-lasting effects, representing the long-term development of an economy, such as interest rates. Focusing on the U.S. economy, we can appreciate different shocks into its economy across the time (Darné & Charles, 2011). The historical US interest dates have suffered many variations and shocks since the 19th century, such as different ‘panics’ by the end of 19th century, World War I (1914), the Great Depression (1929), World War II (1939), the oil price crises in 1973 and 1978 and/or the subprime mortgage crisis (2007)==== and its aftermath (see Gil-Alana, Cunado, & Gupta, 2017 or Egea & Hierro, 2019).====In this sense, the analysis of the possible relationship between short- and long-term interest rates have been conducted twofold. On the one hand, a group of studies uses unit root and cointegration tests to analyze whether shocks permanently affect the interest rates but, unfortunately, they possess low power and complicate inference about persistence (Neely & Rapach, 2008). On the other hand, other studies consider whether interest rates are fractionally integrated, which gives more flexibility and accuracy relative to persistence and, depending the integration degree, the features of the persistence will be different, i.e., they could follow stationary or nonstationary but mean-reverting process. Additionally, regarding the spread resulting the difference of short- versus long-term rates, some authors support that the degree of integration would be different from ====(0) (Strohsal and Weber, 2014 or Holmes et al., 2015, for instance), i.e., integrated in order ====(====). Thus, by using two very long span of databases, i.e., the ==== and ==== aiming to explain whether the monetary authorities interventions would be more or less effective and how different impacts in the economy have affected both interest rates through the transmission mechanism. In addition, according to the FVECM, the spread has predicted power in the bearing of futures short-term rates. We also find that the long-term rates drive the long-run relationship, which may be a marker of the term spread persistence.====In sum, to the best of our knowledge, our approach, i.e., the Fractionally Cointegrated Vector Autorregressive (FCVAR) model (Johansen & Nielsen, 2012), lets us model and explore the fulfilment of the EHTS as a preliminary step of monetary policy effectiveness and the stationarity of the term spread, jointly. This methodology allows us to consider no-contemplative scenarios until now, which provides us tools for the implementation of policies. Finally, we show what is the driver between the short- and long-run interest rates relationship, which may give us a clue of how the path of monetary policy transmission is.====The rest of the paper is as follows.

The study, particularly, analyses the role of Pakistan’s regional foreign policy towards neighbouring India, Afghan wars, and the relations with bi-polar fundamental Muslim Block, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Iran, on sectarian (religious) terrorist incidents for the period 1973–2017. The findings suggest that economic cooperation with India which drive peace-making relations increases the sectarian terrorism. Both the bilateral loans disbursed by the KSA and trade relations with Iran, significantly increase the chances of sectarian terrorism in Pakistan by activating extremist (proxy) groups. However, the Afghan Wars that call for Pak-US strategic partnership helps Pakistan to control the religious terrorism.","Academically, the phenomenon of terrorism received more attention after the 9/11 incident and the War on Terror that consequently increased the terrorist attacks globally, especially in Western Europe, Middle East, South East Asia, as well as in South Asia (specifically Pakistan). There is a reasonable amount of literature that determines important demographic, socio-economic, and political factors influencing terrorism in Pakistan (for example, see, Looney, 2004; Murphy & Malik, 2009; Nasir, Ali, & Rehman, 2011; Shahbaz, 2013; Shahbaz, Shabbir, Malik, & Wolters, 2013; Ismail & Amjad, 2014; Syed, Saeed, & Martin, 2015). Similarly, a number of studies have been conducted to measure the impact of terrorism on Pakistan’s economy, which it is estimated, has suffered more than a $123 billion loss during the War on Terror==== (for example, see, Alam, 2012; Malik & Zaman, 2013; Raza & Jawaid, 2013; Mehmood, 2014; Estrada, Park, Kim, & Khan, 2015). Apart from determining economic, social and political factors, less attention is given to foreign policy, military and strategic factors to empirically examine their role in influencing (religious) terrorism in Pakistan. This study contributes to the literature by empirically investigating the sectarian terrorism from Pakistan’s regional foreign policy perspective particularly towards India and the Afghan Wars that call for Pak-US regional strategic partnership. Importantly, the paper adds in the empirical literature by determining the role of fundamental bi-polar Sunni and Shia Muslim world, the radical ====) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the ==== Islamic Republic of Iran for (potentially) staging proxy-wars, leading towards the sectarian terrorism in Pakistan. The findings of this paper offer important implications for policymakers to revisit and re-balance the relationships with the fundamental Muslim world and neighboring countries to reduce sectarian terrorism in Pakistan.====The recent literature documents the important role of foreign policy in influencing the terrorism. Savun and Phillips (2009) determine the positive relationship between active foreign policy variables and (transnational) terrorism. They argue that democratic regimes are targeted by transnational terrorists because of their active foreign policy rather than the nature of the regime. The active foreign policy that may make countries vulnerable to terrorism has been measured by three basic indicators: involvement of a foreign policy crisis due to conflict with other states, active foreign policy by making an alliance with the US, and the frequency by which states intervene in civil wars.==== Following this, we consider the bordering conflict with neighbouring India as well as an important role played by Pakistan as a US ally in the Afghan wars.====Pakistan is the sixth largest populated country in the world with majority (96 percent) Muslims (75–80 percent Sunni Muslims and approximately 20–25 percent Shiites)==== while other 4 percent include Ahmedis, Christians, Hindus, etc. Undoubtedly, the KSA has long been supporting Pakistan not only in bilateral assistance (loans and grants) but also in providing oil on deferred payment plans. In retrospect, neighbouring Iran used to provide economic assistance before the Islamic Revolution. However, the regime shift leading to long-lasting economic sanctions over the decades resulted in aid suspension and called for enhanced trade relationships that faced fluctuations over time. The Islamic Revolution of 1979 in Iran has had severe repercussions on neighbouring Pakistan by promoting Shiite voice and movements demanding own ==== rights (Mohammad-Arif, 2004; Waterman, 2014). General Zia ul Haq, then military ruler of Pakistan, received a great amount of support from KSA to control the Shiites by promoting Wahhabism through the establishment of madrassas across Pakistan and supporting radical clerics (Mohammad-Arif, 2004; Steinberg & Woermer, 2013). Further, the Shiites of Parachinar and Gilgit-Baltistan were disconnected through illegal settlements of the ====/==== radicals in Hangu and Kohistan areas respectively.==== This broke out the verbal and physical abuse and violence amongst various Muslim sects with one ==== radicals having security agencies support led to the unequal and unfair role of religious radicals in mainstream politics and proxy defence line (for example, see, Riaz, 2005; Abbas, 2006; Ashraf, 2012).====The Russian (former Soviet) invasion in Afghanistan further fuelled the sectarian violence situation when the United States called for support from Pakistan to fight against Soviet (Waterman, 2014). The US assisted Pakistan to establish ==== madrassas (seminaries) producing Sunni (====/====) radicals to fight in the name of Jihad in Afghanistan by providing financial assistance and weapons. Equally, the KSA provided funds to Pakistan matching with each US dollar assistance, to establish the radical madrassas recruiting the children from under-privileged areas along the Pak-Afghan border, Balochistan, and Southern Punjab (Racimora, 2013; Steinberg & Woermer, 2013). After the withdrawal of Russian troops from Afghanistan, Washington suspended its support on account of Pakistan’s drive for nuclear capabilities. The cold distant US-Pak relationship during the 1990s (named as ‘lost-decade’) pushed Pakistan to decommission the radical madrassa’s ==== itself.==== The establishment of the Taliban government in Afghanistan further strengthened the relations between Sunni (====) radicals in Afghanistan and Pakistani security agencies. Later, radicals established different armed organizations (====, ====.) involved in cross-border terrorism in Kashmir and sectarian killings of Shiites, Sunni (====/====) and minorities including Ahmedis, Christians and Hindus.==== This led to the uprise of armed Shiite movement (====) and Barelvi organizations. It is perceived that both KSA and Iran have been involved in staging soft proxy wars in Pakistan promoting sectarian terrorism. On other hand, security agencies’ support to (====) radicals and the space provided to them by governments in different levels of religious affairs, results in their participation in main-stream politics.==== This raises a question about the state’s response to terrorism since militant organizations have long been perceived as a proxy front-line defence, playing roles both along the Western and Eastern borders with Afghanistan and India respectively.====The United States that once helped Pakistan to produce radicals against Soviet later made a fundamental shift in its policy from supporting to target ==== in connection with Al-Qaida footings in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001 attack. The 9/11 incident pushed Pakistan to rethink its policy of promoting ====/==== radicals affiliated with Taliban and Al-Qaida as well as their role in religious affairs, policies, politics, and consideration as a proxy front-line defence.==== The important front-line role of Pakistan (as a strategic ally of US) in the War on Terror (WOT) providing intelligence, surveillance, military operations, land routes for NATO supplies, and airbases for US fighter jets created backlash to face an enormous amount of high-visibility terrorists attacks while combating Al-Qaida and Taliban networks. Moreover, the drone attacks inside Pakistan along the Pak-Afghan border resulted in civilian killings especially children, is perceived to escalate the terrorist attacks.==== As mentioned earlier, the intense waves of terrorists’ attacks led the economy to suffer more than a $123 billion loss.====Pakistan’s relations with India have remained fluctuated due to Kashmir. Historically, this permanent bordering conflict escalated three wars, limited sectoral wars (in Kargil), countless crossfires along the line of control (LOC) and numerous cross-border terrorist activities from both sides. The Indian government accuses Pakistan of training and facilitating infiltration of ==== radicals’ armed organizations in Indian occupied Kashmir (IOK) supporting local Kashmiris’ freedom movement against Indian security forces.==== India has pushed Pakistan repeatedly to control its banned outfits or armed wings acclaiming Jihad in Indian occupied Kashmir. Resultantly, the domestic policy towards Sunni (====) radicals was revisited to reduce their role subsequently during the WOT, especially after the Mumbai attack that accused Pakistan of its non-state military actors’ involvement in conducting terrorist attacks in India. Conversely, Pakistan alleges India for its role in strengthening rebel movements in Balochistan and conducting terrorist activities controlled through Afghan land.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

This dual goal involves some possible trade-offs between inflation and unemployment, often called the Phillips curve and the appraisal of their associated risks. For example, the fight against inflation during the 1970s and early 1980s had as a consequence the increase in unemployment.

By supporting such an hypothesis, our analysis suggests that in the presence of more information, the implicit contract between the government and taxpayers displays less stringent incentives and participation constraints and causes part of the contract, namely tax morale, to be enhanced. This finding supports the implementation of fiscal transparency policies, whose possible design is discussed.","The roots of attitudes to tax obligations lie not only in purely economic, institutional and political factors (e.g. Andreoni, Erard, & Feinstein, 1998; Kim, 2008) but also in some form of moral obligation or civic duty (Torgler, 2002, 2007). The rich bundle of moral and ethical forces shaping individual attitudes to paying taxes goes under the term of tax morale. This has been defined “broadly as an umbrella term capturing nonpecuniary motivations for tax compliance as well as factors that fall outside the standard, expected utility framework” (Luttmer & Singhal, 2014, p. 150). Among potential mechanisms through which tax morale operates, the literature has emphasized that the vertical relationship between the governing authority and taxpayers matters for tax compliance decisions (Bazart & Bonein, 2014; Luttmer & Singhal, 2014).====Trust in, and the power of, tax authorities, satisfaction with the government, the ability to make one’s voice heard and hold authorities accountable, the rule of law, government effectiveness and procedural justice, control of corruption, and administrative efficiency have already been described as important contributors to tax-compliant attitudes (Torgler, 2007; Alm & Torgler, 2011; Feld & Frey, 2007; Torgler, 2007; Bird, Martinez-Vazquez, & Torgler, 2008; Kirchler, Hoelzl, & Wahl, 2008; Daude, Gutiérrez, & Melguizo, 2012). However, empirical efforts concerning how disclosure of fiscal information may affect tax compliance are still lacking. This is surprising considering that the importance of fiscal transparency in making citizens better informed about the use of public resources and the fairness of the tax system is widely acknowledged both by academics and practitioners (IMF, 2018; Rodríguez Bolívar, Galera, & Muñoz, 2015). Moreover, global networks such as the Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency (GIFT), which raise awareness of accountability concerns in the citizens-government relationship, highlight the importance of access to quality information to promote willingness to pay taxes.This paper fills this gap by providing evidence regarding the link between fiscal transparency and tax morale, within a policy framework aimed at reducing tax avoidance and evasion.====If tax payments are made in exchange for public goods and services provided by the state, taxation can be extensively interpreted as an implicit contract between the government and taxpayers (Feld & Fey, 2007; Bird et al., 2008; Luttmer & Singhal, 2014). As in any other form of contract with informational costs, the willingness to pay taxes is relevant not only to determine the payoffs, but also the level of information disclosure between the two parties. The interplay between tax morale and information transparency is thus supposed to quantify and shape the incentives to adhere to the contractual agreement.====Defined as the disclosure of financial and non-financial information regarding governmental decision-making procedures and transactions (Kopits & Craig, 1998), fiscal transparency helps citizens to hold their governments accountable by allowing democratic oversight of domestic budgetary choices. Moreover, it can be a powerful instrument to restore the tax-benefit linkages and to build fiscal legitimacy, which lies at the root of possible compliant behavior in taxation (Bird et al., 2008; Daude et al., 2012).====Starting from this intuition,we reexamine the nature and determinants of tax morale by focusing on the degree of fiscal information disclosure between government and its citizens. Our principal idea is that since tax morale is a major incentive in the contractual agreement in which public goods and services are exchanged for taxes, better informed taxpayers would comply more soundly with their obligation to society.====More precisely, given the level of taxation and services, any improvement in the volume of information concerning a government’s fiscal position and prospects would be reflected in less stringent incentives forcing taxes to be paid. Indeed, with asymmetric information, participation constraints and incentive constraints are necessary components of a contractual agreement, and the contract adjusts the payoffs to satisfy these constraints. Since tax payments are given, an improvement in information disclosure about fiscal accounts and government expenditure would not be transferred to the payoffs but to the incentives to comply with the payment, including the level of tax morale.====To measure the extent of disclosure of government fiscal data, we employ an index of fiscal transparency (GFS Index) which measures the availability and comprehensiveness of government finance statistics according to international standards (Wang, Irwin, & Murara, 2015). Access to information relating to government decisions and financial transactions is supposed to increase tax morale because more observable budget choices cause less distortion in principal-agent problems associated with the relationship between taxpayers and decision-makers (Andreoni et al., 1998) and reduce moral hazard behavior attached to various forms of fiscal illusion (Von Hagen & Harden, 1995; Kopits & Craig, 1998). Greater information disclosure facilitates understanding and surveillance of the use of public resources, thus ameliorating the visibility of the correspondence between such choices and citizens’ preferences, and positively influencing perceptions about the fairness of the tax system. An increased legitimacy of governments’ fiscal behavior restores vertical reciprocity between citizens and the tax authority which, in turn, increases tax morale (Bazart & Bonein, 2014).====We test our assumption by specifying an empirical model in which a measure of tax morale is regressed against an indicator of fiscal transparency and a set of individual-specific variables and socio-economic characteristics. Following previous examples that tried to disentangle individual from country-level determinants of tax compliance (Halla & Schneider, 2008; Lago-Peñas & Lago-Peñas, 2010; Williams & Horodnic, 2016), we employ a multilevel approach that takes account of the link between citizen-level tax morale and country-level covariates. The results show that a higher degree of fiscal transparency is associated with a higher level of tax morale and that this link is robust to the inclusion of a great variety of controls, including the level of corruption.====These findings have relevant policy implications, as they confirm that the transparency of public budgets and control of corruption are non-alternative measures to improve citizens’ attitudes toward tax compliance.These two objectives should be jointly pursued, as they are supposed to work through different, albeit connected, channels (Prichard, Custers, Dom, Davenport, & Roscitt, 2019). Consequently, this paper also enriches the set of possible strategies designed to strengthen tax morale, adding to those recently issued by the OECD (OECD, 2019) and World Bank (Prichard et al., 2019).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section two defines the hypothesis to test and specifies the empirical methodology. Section three describes the data, while section four presents the results of the empirical investigation.

Also, we analyse the impact of students’ characteristics and school-level factors on the probability of being educational poor in various learning dimensions. The findings reveal that between 2006 and 2015 the incidence of educational poverty became more relevant in many European countries, while most of them experienced a reduction of poverty depth and severity. Therefore, several policy scenarios are simulated in order to highlight the school factors that can be activate to alleviate the risk of educational poverty in the European countries that experienced the highest incidence of educational poor student.","What is the evidence about educational poverty in European countries? And which policies can be implemented to reduce the level of educational poverty while improving human capital acquisition? This paper addresses these questions by using data on learning achievements of students participating to two editions of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), in 2006 and 2015.====In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, a specific target (i.e. SDG4) calls for high-quality education, which should guarantee an equitable access to all children. Among the indicators proposed to evaluate countries’ progress in SDG4, the quality of the education system is expressed in terms of the share of 15-years old students achieving low performances in the three PISA learning domains, i.e. reading, mathematics, science. Therefore, the alleviation of educational poverty (i.e. the acquisition of an insufficient amount of learning) becomes a crucial issue deserving the attention and the intervention of national and international organizations and policy makers.====Before this topic gained such political attention, the economic literature expressed a clear interest in it. The existing literature, today, can be broadly classified in two main streams. The first is the measurement of educational poverty, explicitly introduced by Checchi (1998), who addressed the question of how to measure this phenomenon, namely in absolute or relative terms. Since then, other scholars have followed this line, investigating the extent of educational poverty: i) by adopting both the absolute and the relative approach with different definitions of poverty, expressed as missing certificates, competencies levels, years of education (Allmendinger & Leibfried, 2003; Lohman & Ferger, 2014), and ii) by taking into account the complexity of poverty concept, involving several aspects such as incidence, intensity and inequality among the poor (Denny, 2002; Minzyuk & Russo, 2016; Rios-Neto & Rodrigues, 2012; Sanchez et al., 2019; Villar, 2016). At the same time, a second stream of extensive and increasing literature investigates the effect on students’ achievements, derived from various factors that can be influenced by policies and practices, such as: education public expenditure (Agasisti, 2014; Annabi, 2017; Sibiano & Agasisti, 2011); school level variables (Cohen, 2006; Ferraro & Põder, 2018; Güzel & Berberoğlu, 2005; Ma, Jong, & Yuan, 2013; Fantuzzo, Grim, & Hazan, 2005; Henry, 2007; Ning, Van Damme, Van Den Noortgate, Yang, & Gielen, 2015); teaching practices (Cordero & Gil, 2018; Darling-Hammond, 2000); family background (Lagravinese, Liberati, & Resce, 2019). In this stream of the literature, however, few works focus on cross-country analyses of the determinants of educational poverty, expressed in terms of low performances in the OECD-PISA test. Both Rios-Neto and Rodrigues (2012) and Bruckauf and Chzhen (2016) do not provide clear elements for policy building by studying the determinants of poverty at the country level by using cross-sectional macro-regressions with educational poverty outcome measures as dependent variables, while the OECD (2016) report provides estimates of the likelihood of low performance in mathematics based on simple, binary logistic micro-regression analyses.====This paper contributes to the mentioned strands of the literature, in two major ways.====The first contribution is methodological, and consists in measuring educational poverty in European countries according to a multidimensional approach. We posit that the students’ educational “background” is a multidimensional concept and an exhaustive analysis of the complete learning deprivation status cannot be restricted to a single educational subject. By adopting the definition of underachievers (i.e. students who do not reach a predefined proficiency level), proposed by OECD within the framework of PISA data, for the first time we assess the degree of educational poverty using from an international perspective the class of additive multidimensional poverty measures proposed by Alkire and Foster (2011). It is worth noting that these indices allow taking into account the different aspects of poverty, i.e. incidence, breadth, severity and inequality, which definitions are given in Section 2.====The second innovation is that we move beyond the description of the quantitative relevance of the phenomenon at the country level. By exploiting the microdata of the OECD-PISA survey 2015, we investigate the impact of both students’ characteristics and school-level factors on the probability of being poor in one or more PISA learning domains. In this way, it is possible to identify some potential mechanisms associated with the risk of educational poverty, and then to derive policy suggestions for actionable school interventions aimed at reducing such risk.====The main findings reveal that between 2006 and 2015 the incidence of educational poverty became more relevant in many European countries, while most of them experienced a reduction of poverty depth and severity. In addition, the econometric analysis reveals that many school factors can be manipulated with the aim of reducing the likelihood of students becoming educationally poor.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the methodological approach.

The NMS are obliged to adopt the common currency; however, the exact date of the accession to the euro area has not been set for many of them. The accession requires the fulfillment of the Maastricht convergence criteria. One of them is related to the accession to the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) to reduce the exchange rate variability. So far, only the seven smallest NMS joined the euro area. Slovenia was the first of the NMS to join it in 2007. Cyprus and Malta joined the euro area in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015. However, the bigger NMS, such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Romania, despite their declarations to adopt the euro, have not even joined the ERM II so far.====The recent Greek crisis has made the euro adoption less attractive to these countries and delayed the process of the euro area enlargement. It turned out that fiscal harmonization is the key issue for the proper operation of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). However, fiscal harmonization among the EMU members is still a goal involving major difficulties for its implementation. Surprisingly, both theoretical and empirical studies on the potential effects of fiscal harmonization for both the old and the new EU member states remain relatively scarce. In particular, the studies on the ==== effects of fiscal harmonization for Poland are virtually non-existent. At the same time, tax harmonization may have important adverse effects for the economies adopting the common currency, which are at different levels of economic development and have structures of their economies that are different from the old EU member states.====Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to evaluate the ==== effects of fiscal harmonization on the rate of economic growth in Poland using a neoclassical dynamic two-sector general equilibrium model and derive policy recommendations. Poland is the biggest country of all the NMS, both in terms of GDP and population. However, it is less developed compared not only to the old EU members but also the NMS, and its economy is significantly different from the developed economies that have established the European Monetary Union.====In this paper, we consider two policy scenarios. In the first one, we adjust all taxes to German and EU-27 levels, respectively, while in the second one, we change only consumption taxes to German and EU-27 levels. We find that in the first one, the current Polish taxes yield the highest rate of growth due to lower capital taxation. However, in the second one, German and EU-27 taxes yield the highest rate of growth due to the lower consumption tax on capital-intensive goods, which increases demand for capital, drives rental rate upward, and increases incentives to save.====Our policy results suggest that changes in the tax policy would have non-negligible effects on the rate of economic growth in Poland. In the case of a call for fiscal harmonization in Poland, from a growth perspective, our model recommends a partial harmonization, only the adaptation of the consumption taxes in Poland to German or average EU-27 rates.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide the literature review. In Section 3, we introduce our theoretical framework. In Section 4, we describe the statistical data used in our analysis.

European institutions mostly focused on the convergence of inflation rates and budget positions, primarily through monetary policy and the Stability and Growth Pact. The less well-known Macroeconomic Dialogue, which sought to reduce unemployment by defining a balanced macroeconomic policy mix, was part of the formal set of coordination procedures, but it made little substantive difference. Two conceptual issues contributed to this failure.====First of all, at the core of the Macroeconomic Dialogue stood the concept of aggregate unit labour costs (ULCs), which linked wage bargaining to monetary policy. The Dialogue's (non-binding) policy recommendation that ULCs in the Euro Area ought to grow at the rate of the ECB inflation target (Koll, 2005) was inspired by the ====–====, whereby wage settlements are distributionally neutral if nominal wages increase at the rate of labour productivity plus inflation. It was thought that following this rule would take stress off the central bank and would facilitate stability oriented fiscal policies and thereby support growth.==== However, in reality only few countries complied. While aggregate ULCs roughly increased at the rate of the ECB-inflation target before 2007, many individual member states did not follow the rule; during the Euro crisis, even the aggregate ULC index remained behind the ECB target (see Fig. 1), which makes it harder for the ECB to achieve its objective of price stability. The reason for this slow growth are multiple, but a recent study by the ECB concludes that the country dimension is crucial to understanding the drivers of Euro Area wage growth (Nickel, Bobeica, Koester, Lis, & Porqueddu, 2019).====The second conceptual issue were current accounts. It is often not clear whether deficits were assumed to be the result of lack of competitiveness in the product market and cost disadvantages or of excessive capital inflows which would reflect comparative advantages. In the early phase of monetary union, current account divergences increased, but they were seen as the outcome of a real convergence process (Blanchard & Giavazzi, 2002). The inflow of foreign capital into catching up countries, especially in the form of FDI, would cause current account deficits, but over the long run that would increase competitiveness in these countries and eventually improve their net trade position. However, with the financial crisis and the sudden stop of capital flows, the problems with this model became evident. A growing body of research started to analyse these imbalances as a problem of competitiveness caused by wage cost distortions (Chen, Milesi-Ferretti, & Tressel, 2013; Collignon, 2014; European Commission, 2014; Giannellis & Joukouritakis, 2017; Guerrieri & Esposito, 2012; Salvatore, 2015; Sinn, 2014;). The deterioration of current account balances was interpreted as the consequence of competitive disadvantages caused by excessive nominal wages increases in the periphery. However, this causal link was soon put into question. New evidence indicated that capital flows from the core to the periphery had created bubbles in the construction and real estate sector, which supported the rapid wage increases above productivity, and this had fuelled consumption booms (Croci-Angelini and Farina, 2012, Esposito, 2017). When the bubble burst, profits collapsed and these wages levels were unsustainable. In some countries, the banking sector required public bailouts, which generated massive increases in public debt. Spain and Ireland are the good examples, although similar dynamics were also at work in Greece, Italy and Portugal. Countries with high levels of public debt were economically most fragile and required structural reforms.====The policy consensus focused on current accounts and labour market rigidities, which prevented the required economic adjustments. Member states with low wage growth, above all Germany and the Netherlands, were increasing their surpluses; those with rapid wage increases, mainly in the southern periphery, witnessed growing deficits. Divergences in ULC indices and ULC-based Real Effective Exchange Rates (REER) seemed to match this explanation, although curiously the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe seemed to live on a different planet. Consequently, policy makers recommended that deficit countries (i.e. the periphery) should improve their cost competitiveness by the “internal depreciation” of their REER. Wage cost and labour market institutions were seen as key variables behind the Euro crisis.====Following this logic, the European Commission created two new institutions: the Euro Plus and the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP). The Euro Plus included a broad set of provisions ranging from productivity-enhancing structural reforms to measures aimed at improving the sustainability of public finances. The MIP monitored developments in internal and external imbalances through a vast scoreboard of indicators where ULCs, REERs, current account balances and market shares played a prominent role. The policy generated asymmetric adjustment, because it treated excessive surpluses as lees detrimental to the stability of the EMU than excessive deficits – a logical conundrum that only makes sense if the Euro Area as a whole is supposed to run a current account surplus. Competitiveness, however, now focused on national ULC developments and REERs between member states. Wage moderation was to be achieved by reforming national wage setting and indexation schemes, especially in the public sector.====The focus on ULCs has justified excessive austerity and caused deep welfare losses. Not surprisingly, some economists started to praise monetary sovereignism again, calling either a return to the previous EMS fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate regime of the 1980s and 1990s (Flassbeck & Lapavitsas, 2013) or claiming that losing control over their currency prevents euro-members from monetizing their sovereign debt. De Grauwe (2012) wrote that “there is an important, potentially destructive dynamic in a monetary union”, although Mabbett and Schelkle (2015) subsequently found that the evidence does not support this claim.====The analysis of competitiveness based on ULCs and NEER is misleading, because ULCs do not provide information on competitiveness ====. Indices ignore possible disequilibria in the base year. Nor do they explain what determines such equilibrium level.==== To address this issue, we propose an alternative measure based on the simple assumption of convergence of the returns on capital in a single market with monetary union. By using the functional distribution of income into capital and wage shares and comparing it to the Euro average, we derive regional wage levels and develop a Wage Competitiveness Index (WCI) as the difference (ratio) between actual and equilibrium wages.====The policy focus is, therefore, not only on wage setting, but also more broadly on all factors, which affect the return on capital. Current account disequilibria are useful indicators for monitoring the evolution of financial flows, especially when they lead to asset bubbles. However, neither current account deficits nor rising ULCs signal necessarily competitive deteriorations as they might be the result of a catching up process in prices or in consumption levels (Blanchard & Giavazzi, 2002). This is very clear in the case of new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, which had huge wage cost advantages, despite rising ULCs, and still ran current account deficits. Furthermore, the current accounts focus treats Euro member states as if they had adopted a fixed exchange rate regime rather than formed a monetary union (Collignon, 2014). However, it was the experience with fixed-but-adjustable exchange rates in the 1980s that made policy makers realize that national currencies were not compatible with Europe's single market (Collignon and Schwarzer, 2003, Padoa-Schioppa and Emerson, 1987).====The story told by our WCI is different from that of the ULC-current account approach. First, it shows that the divergent dynamics of relative labour cost competitiveness was less marked in the years before the crisis than often thought. Second, the divergent dynamics are the result of convergence towards the equilibrium in some southern members as well as in Germany. Third, we show that in the new CEECs member states a major distortion has occurred due to the low nominal wage growth relative to total productivity. These countries experienced high growth of equilibrium wages while restraining nominal wage growth. Fourth, our WCI explains competitiveness better in terms of market shares and attractiveness of FDI. After controlling for reverse causality, our results show a real causal relation.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the problems with the use of indices and introduces the intuition behind the WCI. Section 3 explains the methodology to calculate equilibrium wages and the WCI. Section 4 provides some descriptive evidence on the convergence of returns on capital in the Euro Area and compares our measure with the standard indicators of international competitiveness.

Following extensive discussion of policy options, we set out a model that explores the impacts of the real policy rate on economic growth, employment and inflation, with particular attention to the British economy. We use a Time-Varying Structural Vector Auto-regressive (TVSVAR) Model where the sources of time variation are both the coefficients and variance–covariance matrix of the innovations. It was found that real rates have significant implications for real growth, the labour market and price stability even when monetary policy was constrained at the ZLB in nominal terms. The study additionally applies a discrete break in the data to focus on the Post-Global Financial Crisis and ZLB period. This indicates that the effectiveness of real rates did not diminish and this has important implications in terms of a policy approach which seeks to exploit real negative rates.","). For Japan, official interest rates have been close to the ZLB for the last two decades while the UK, US and Germany have converged around the ZLB in recent years.==== All of these countries have also augmented their monetary policy with large-scale asset purchases or Q. Es (====).==== This low-interest rate environment has not only prevailed in the major economies but can also be observed in some of the developing countries (====)====The Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) is a landmark in monetary policy formulation. It has significance in the context that once we reach this point, a question arises regarding what further steps a monetary authority can take. There is a theory-policy fork in the road for the future of monetary policymaking. Three policy options arise: a) ==== b) ==== and/or c) ====. In the next section, we provide a detailed discussion of the various proposals and options available to policymakers while at the ZLB. The ZLB constraint also reflects the fact that there are limits to what we can expect monetary policy to deliver regarding the goals of price and economic stability. Perhaps, coordination will be required from a fiscal counterpart, as argued by ==== (for more recent discussion, see ====, ====, ====, ====, ==== for insightful reasoning on the significance of policy coordination).====The traditional view on nominal interest rates has predominantly considered them as a non-negative entity. As ==== famously stated:====This argument was drawn on the logical foundations laid by ====, while emphasising ==== of economic agents and that the utility of holding money is always positive, even if more money is held than required for transactions or precautionary motives. However, looking at the practices in the recent history of monetary policy formulation, it is notable that in order to further stimulate economies, Japan, followed by some of the European economies, have chosen to cross the ZLB and tentatively enter into the uncharted territory of negative interest rates territory. This strategy of negative interest follows a rationale to diminish the utility of holding money, beyond that which is required for transactions or precautionary motives. Significantly, the economic context, notably the emergence of a situation of secular stagnation, renders some confluence of new monetary policies, which potentially influence the holding of cash attractive to policymakers.====However, on theoretical and practical grounds, the case for the negative interest rates does not seem strong. On theoretical grounds, there are some difficulties in the adoption of negative interest policy, as highlighted by ====, recently discussed by ====, details in the next section). In practice, there is not much evidence of great success or appetite for such a policy. For instance, in the case of the British economy, which has performed comparatively well until the onset of the Brexit saga,==== the general impression has been that official interest rates have not and will not require crossing the ZLB. It has been typically argued that although stimulative policy measures are structured to boost domestic demand, there are limits to the extent to which this can be achieved by negative rates. These limits include, first, banks might not be able to fully pass negative policy rates to their respective retail customers, a reflection of concern commonly expressing the view that negative rates could reduce banks’ profitability; and second, negative rates could lead to the export of excessive saving leading to a global liquidity trap (See ==== for details====). This position seems to be shared by the US Fed (====) and has been maintained by the Bank of England, since the onset of Brexit (the UK policy rate has remained historically low and stable just above zero). UK growth has been modest yet positive in the period after Brexit and despite revisions to inflation forecasts, there has been no concerted pressure to cross the ZLB.====However, it would not be extraordinarily surprising if reductions in interest rates were to occur in the future. Given the modest expectations of growth, the uncertainty created by Brexit and most recently after the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, there is a question as to whether the Bank of England should follow the course adopted by some of its counterparts and opt for negative interest rates to provide further stimulus. Ultimately, the Bank is in the best position to assess this but it is a question worth asking because of the possible implications interest rates can have when held constant at the ZLB. A point to be noted here is that although current nominal interest rates are close to the ZLB in many countries including the UK, real interest rates have not been fixed and have changed frequently in the Post Global Financial Crisis period. If the Bank of England keeps the policy rate at zero and does not opt for the sub-zero option, and inflation occurs then real rates may still be negative or tending downwards. Nevertheless, the Bank of England can still influence real rates through its policy response to inflation and by using instruments other than nominal interest (Bank) rates. For example, Q.E, revision of the inflation mandate and/or quantitative and qualitative “forward guidance”. Here, an accommodating fiscal expansion as argued by ==== can undoubtedly provide a helping hand to monetary policy by exploiting the inflation and real rates nexus.====The confluence of issues stated provides a rationale to investigate the implications of real rates for the economy, and this is the core modelling focus of this paper. We use a Time-Varying Structural Vector Auto-regressive (TVSVAR) framework, which accounts for the time variation in the association between variables of interest and employed data, from 1989 M to 2016 M. Our key findings indicate that real rates are effective for economic growth and in the labour market as well as to influence inflation even when monetary policy is constrained at the ZLB in nominal terms. This provides a profound policy implication. There is a nexus to be exploited between real rates and the economy through the dynamics of inflation by using non-conventional monetary and perhaps, well-coordinated fiscal measures as proposed by Keynes when at the ZLB. There is, more than ever before, a ==== need for coordinated fiscal-monetary measures.====The paper proceeds as follows: to provide context Section ==== provides an extensive discussion of the competing choices available to policymakers when monetary policy is at the ZLB, Section ==== briefly describes the layout of the empirical framework as a means to analyse the implications of real rates for the economy, Section ==== provides the results of the empirical analysis and Section ==== concludes the argument with a discussion of policy prescription and implications.",Zero Lower Bound and negative interest rates: Choices for monetary policy in the UK,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300569,26 May 2020,2020,Research Article,179.0

The Bai–Perron tests suggest that economic growth followed three distinct regimes: accelerated growth in the years 1951–1973 (average growth rate 5.3%); low growth in the period 1974–1995 (average growth rate 1.6%); zero growth on average after 1995. Using cointegration analysis, we find a positive effect of public investment on per unit of labour output of the Mezzogiorno in the whole period, 1951–2011. However, the estimates of the model show statistically significant parameters of public investment in the first regime, but not in the second regime, when economic growth is sustained by business investment and technical change. The last phase of growth sees the negative influence of the social and institutional environment on the functioning of the economy. The different impact of public investment on growth over time is ascribed to changes in the quality of institutions.","Public capital is one of the main determinants of economic growth in an important strand of the theoretical literature. The traditional exogenous growth model – explored in depth by Arrow and Kurz (1970) among others – underlines the permanent effect of public policies on income per capita and the transitory effect on the growth rate. The recent endogenous growth theory (e.g., Barro, 1990; Barro & Sala-I-Martin, 1992; Glomm & Ravikumar, 1994) argues for a permanent effect of policy variables also on the equilibrium growth rate. During the past three decades, the contribution of infrastructures to the productivity of the private sector has been the object of many studies (see the surveys of Mamatzakis, 2007; Bom & Ligthart, 2014). The empirical literature has produced a wide range of estimates.==== Endogeneity of explanatory variables, time series non-stationarity, and parameters’ cross-country heterogeneity are significant econometric issues in this research.====Over the same period, the empirical analysis of economic growth has highlighted an important stylized fact, on the time path of per capita income of developing countries: growth rates are characterized by large instability and volatility. The opposite happened in most of the developed countries. Research on the causes of episodes of growth accelerations or decelerations (Berg, Ostry, & Zettelmeyer, 2012; Hausmann, Pritchett, & Rodrik, 2005; Hausmann, Rodríguez, & Wagner, 2008) strongly suggests this stylized fact cannot be ignored in the econometric assessment of the determinants of economic growth. Researchers concentrate their investigations on the quality of institutions, openness, and other structural factors. A few studies have focused on public capital. In particular, Hausmann et al. (2008) find that telephone mainlines per capita do not explain the probability of a country falling into a crisis; Berg et al. (2012) find the same variable statistically significant in the estimation of a model of the duration of growth episodes. The recent study by Moller and Wacker (2017) analyses the episode of growth acceleration that occurred in Ethiopia during the 2000s. The econometric results suggest investments in telecommunications and roads are important explanatory factors. Carrère and De Melo (2012) study the occurrence of growth events after fiscal events in a panel of 140 countries, and find that the joint event positively correlates with a growing share of transport and communication expenditure.====In this paper, we investigate the causal effects of public capital on GDP per unit of labour under different growth regimes in Southern Italy after World War II. The historical experience of Southern Italy provides an interesting case study because in the fifties and sixties the region rapidly grew catching up with the rest of Italy, while in the following decades the gap widened again. Italy’s regional inequalities, especially the origins and evolution of its North-South divide (Lepore, 2017), have been vastly debated since the nineteenth century, in academic circles and beyond, not least for its international appeal (e.g. Carey & Carey, 1955; Carlyle, 1962; Putnam, Leonardi, & Nanetti, 1993).====The North–South economic divide, after reaching its peak in the aftermath of World War II, decreased during the “golden age” (1950s’ and 1960s’). With the oil crisis of the seventies, however, Southern Italy stopped converging and even fell back once again. The changes observed in the second half of the twentieth century – convergence, then paralysis and divergence again – took place at the same time when a massive state intervention, called “extraordinary intervention”, was carried out to develop the South, mostly through the state-owned agency ==== (1950–1984). However, by the mid-1970s this agency had lost effectiveness due to growing political pressure, so much so that it ended in disrepute, favouring corruption (e.g., Del Monte & Papagni, 2007), unproductive expenses and even organised crime (e.g., Baraldi, 2008).====The present article investigates the long-run causal relationship between public and private investments and real GDP, by adopting the time series approach of cointegration. Disposing of unpublished data on public investment at regional level in the years 1995–2011, we provide the first econometric analysis of the factors of the economic development of Southern Italy after World War II.====A main feature of this analysis is the focus on structural change in the process of economic growth, as suggested by an extensive literature. The period of our analysis (1951–2011) allowed us to test the hypothesis of structural breaks in the Mezzogiorno’s economic growth. This represents an important contribution of the present work. The application of the methods of Bai and Perron (1998, 2003) highlights three different growth regimes after World War II: the convergence, 1951–1973, with average growth rate 5.3%; the following period, 1974–1995, when the average growth rate was much lower, 1.6%, and the gap with the Centre-North widened again; the recent period, 1996–2011, with null growth and the profound crisis of the Mezzogiorno’s economy.====The application of Johansen’s (1991) multivariate methodology supports the presence of one long-run cointegrating equation over the whole period. Estimation of the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) provides statistical evidence coherent with the weak exogeneity of the determinants of output per worker in Southern Italy. The estimated equilibrium relationships indicate that both public and business investment Granger cause in the long run the GDP per worker of Southern Italy in the period after World War II. A significant parameter of the trend suggests an important role for technical progress in the same process.====The relevance and timing of structural change is confirmed by the implementation of the Hansen (1992) testing methodology to the long-run equation relating GDP per worker to public and business capital accumulation. From application of the Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) (Phillips & Hansen, 1990) to the same cointegration model on the time series of the three distinct regimes, it emerges that during the 1950s and 1960s the successful growth model of the Mezzogiorno was led by infrastructure investments jointly with the contribution of private investments and technical change. However, in the following regime (1974–1995) structural public intervention lost its efficacy and the economy relied on the business sector, with lower effects. The estimates on the most recent growth regime (1996–2011) suggest that the profound crisis of the Mezzogiorno economy depends on the main factors of growth being largely inefficient, likely because of the negative effects of the social and institutional environment (Felice, 2018). Hence, our estimates support the view that public capital can be an important factor of growth in the context of favourable institutional environments, and be responsible for growth deceleration if its efficiency is low as a consequence of administrative bureaucracy, corruption, rent-seeking and other features of bad institutions (Del Monte & Papagni, 2001).====Through the econometric analysis of an important case of economic development, this paper provides three main contributions to the literature on public capital and economic growth.==== First, we obtain a significant effect of public investment on aggregate productivity with the application of the econometric methods of cointegration and the assessment of the long-run weak exogeneity of the explanatory variables. Second, we study growth transitions by estimating a model of per worker GDP on time series for each growth regime; in other words, we highlight what has changed in the determinants of growth before and after the transition; this approach is new in literature, where the available studies, using cross-country panels (see the references above in this section), seek for the determinants of the probability of growth transitions. Third, we find that public investment is an important cause of growth accelerations====The article is organised as follows.

Finally, structural reforms since the euro crisis have contributed to make labor market structures in Eurozone countries more similar, which contributed to improve the resilience of the Eurozone, but the job is not completed yet.","The optimum currency areas (OCA) theory suggests that countries that form a currency union and therefore give up the ability to respond to shocks via monetary policy should have other tools – such as labor mobility and product and labor market flexibility – to smoothly absorb asymmetric shocks. In a similar way, countries with a sufficient degree of real convergence and with similar economic structures would be less likely to experience asymmetric shocks.====However, at the time the euro was introduced, the main focus was put on nominal convergence: the Maastricht criteria defined nominal convergence in terms of nominal variables such as interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, government deficits and debt. It was expected, then, that the creation of the single currency would create an incentive for Member States to put in place those structural reforms that would make the functioning of their product and labor markets more similar and ultimately foster structural convergence (Buti & Turrini, 2015).====The global economic and financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone showed that “structural reforms incentive” of a currency union had not worked, and that key reforms still had to be put in place at both euro area and Member State level in order to create more resilient economic structures should a new crisis arrive. In particular, over the first decade of the euro, several euro area countries (in particular Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy) had accumulated large current account imbalances as a result of diverging wage and unit labor cost developments with respect to the rest of the euro area. This competitiveness loss was most likely the fundamental cause of the euro crisis, whereas the mounting government deficit and debt contributed to postpone the competitiveness loss from becoming evident (Salvatore, 2015).====Understanding wage determination in the euro area is a matter of primary policy relevance, as demonstrated by the emphasis that the OECD, the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB, among others, have put on labor market reforms and wage flexibility in recent years, if anything because of the relevance of labor market dynamics for the smooth functioning of the monetary union.====In fact, wage developments matter in a currency union for a number of reasons. First and foremost, wage developments have been identified as one of the drivers of business cycle divergence in particular among countries who share the same currency (Gächter, Gruber, & Riedl, 2017), and the lack of wage coordination among Eurozone countries is likely to have contributed to the build-up of those imbalances which became evident when the crisis showed up (Gächter, Ramskogler, & Riedl, 2018). More specifically, heterogeneity in the functioning of labor markets in the euro area is a potential source of asymmetric shocks and/or asymmetric response to a common shock and is thus relevant in the context of a single monetary policy. Such heterogeneity may be due to institutional factors, like the degree of employment protection, the level of bargaining coordination or the type of wage leadership across sectors, since leadership of a non-traded sector in some countries may be conducive to wage non-moderation, other things equal.==== Indeed, Jaumotte and Morsy (2012) have recently shown that high employment protection and intermediate coordination in collective bargaining have contributed significantly to the high and persistent inflation differentials of several EMU countries in the run-up to the crisis.====Secondly, wage developments have important second-round effects on prices and, therefore, potentially on (price) competitiveness.==== Specifically for euro area countries, in the absence of the nominal exchange rate as an adjustment tool, excessive inflation (relative to the rest of the Monetary Union) has to be corrected, eventually, via internal devaluation. Thirdly, labor and product markets that are more responsive to shocks allow for smooth resource reallocation and therefore increase the resilience of the economy.====Against this background, the objective of this paper is to answer the following questions: to what extent are euro area countries similar in terms of wage determination? Secondly, if that is not the case, can we identify alternative “models” of wage determination across groups of euro area countries? Thirdly, did the reforms occurred since the crisis contribute to make wages in the Eurozone more “market-determined”? To this end, we estimate a very simple long-run wage equation for a subset of the euro area using panel cointegration techniques that allow for country heterogeneity and the existence of (unknown) structural breaks.====Among others, Boeri (2002) following Ferrera (1998) has already highlighted the prevalence of different labor market “models” in the EU. According to Boeri, four models of social policy prevailed in the EU-15 at the end of the 20th century: Nordic, Continental, Anglo-Saxon and Mediterranean.==== Sapir (2006), on the same page, evaluated the performance of these four models according to the criterion of labor market participation in terms of efficiency (i.e. relatively high employment rates) and equity (i.e. keeping the risk of poverty relatively low). In his analysis, Nordic countries scored best on both criteria; the continental model provided equity at the price of somewhat low efficiency while the opposite held for Anglo-Saxon countries. Finally, Mediterranean countries scored badly on both dimensions.====In a recent paper, Camarero, D’Adamo, and Tamarit (2016), estimated the wage equation for the euro area accounting for labor market institutions, finding that more flexible labor market institutions are compatible with wage moderation, and that, the importance of productivity and real exchange rate dynamics in explaining wage developments increased with respect to institutional factors and unemployment since the Eastern enlargement. Furthermore, previous research (Arpaia & Pichelmann, 2007) has, in fact, shown that labor cost developments in the euro area have not always reflected warranted adjustments, but rather different degrees of wage flexibility across countries.====Fig. 1 reports the developments in wages and productivity in a subset of Eurozone countries between 1995 and 2015. In general, wages and productivity have been moving quite closely. The most apparent stylized facts are the higher productivity than wage growth in Germany, which resulted in a decline in nominal unit labor costs over the period, and the substantial decoupling between wages and productivity in Ireland, Spain and Portugal before the crisis and subsequent wage stagnation, as well as the well-known wage- and productivity slowdown in Italy.====One may therefore ask whether we can indeed assume that a common wage equation for the whole EMU exists or clusters of labor market models can be identified in the Monetary Union. In the present paper, we therefore estimate a simple model of the wage equation for a subset of Eurozone countries, paying special attention to the common patterns and differences among EMU member states, using panel techniques that allow for cross-country heterogeneity and structural breaks and quarterly data for the period 1995–2015. In particular, we estimate long-run relationships, allow for structural changes in the deterministic components and/or in the cointegration parameters, and test for homogeneity in the panel. The application of the method of Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999), that is, the Pool Mean Group Estimator (or PMGE), to the data allows us to test statistically the homogeneity of wage equation. By letting the data speak, we identify two relatively distinct groups of countries: on one side Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Finland, with a more dynamic wage determination and a homogeneous wage equation, and on the other side France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland with a more heterogeneous wage determination model.====The paper is organized as follows: after this introduction, the second section defines the wage equation and Section 3 presents the dataset and the econometric methodology. Section 4 reports the results of the analysis assuming a common wage equation for the EMU while Section 5 introduces the results allowing for cross-country heterogeneity.

The present work has two goals. Firstly, it aims to measure the efficiency of Indian high courts using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Secondly, it studies the impact of including pending cases on judicial efficiency. The first DEA model takes only judicial resources, namely, number of judges and staff members as inputs, and two outputs, viz., number of civil and criminal cases disposed. Since further data analysis reveals a role for using caseload as an input, two more DEA models are developed to incorporate these factors. The first includes the number of civil and criminal cases instituted during the year as inputs, and the second incorporates the effect of both incoming and pending cases. Models 2 and 3 help to distinguish between the courts that are efficient with respect to incoming cases, and those that are able to efficiently manage their total workload. Results identify the specific courts that are efficient in disposing cases, including the effect of their high volume. They point to policy imperatives and overall peer learning, as well as for specific aspects such as dealing with high pendency or fresh institution of cases. Finally, a comparison between these models can help the judicial officials of inefficient courts develop reforms with specific aims such as reducing backlog of cases, matching outflow and inflow of cases, or in some cases, both.","India is an emerging economy with a population of over 1.3 billion. In terms of the World Bank’s quality of judicial processes index, India scores 10.5 on a scale from 0 to 18. It costs nearly 31% of the claim value and 1445 days on an average to resolve a commercial dispute in Indian courts of first instance.====Justice is guaranteed by the Indian State to all citizens under the Preamble and Articles 14, 19, 21, 32, 226 of the Constitution of India. The timely dispensation of justice is a constitutional obligation of the State in light of the Directive Principles of State Policy articulated in Articles 38(1), 39 and 39A of the Constitution of India. However, Indian courts are known for their inability to meet the public’s demand, slow resolution of cases, and the building backlog (Devulapalli & Padmanabhan, 2019; Ministry of Finance, 2019). The conventional wisdom believes that the primary reason is a severe shortage of judges and inability to fill judicial vacancies (Deshpande, 2019; Mathur & Mandal, 2018; Thankur, 2019).====Additionally, however, other aspects need to be considered. For example, Buscaglia and Dakolias (1999) finds that nations which invest more in technology and infrastructure show improvements in clearance rates and duration of cases as compared to those that focus on increasing judicial strength and salaries alone. Some studies such as Walsh (2008) argue that India needs to move from talking about judicial numbers to determining judicial productivity. Table 1 presents the Indian judicial system in numbers as on 31 July, 2019. There are around 18 judges per million population in India, against a recommended figure of 50 per million in Law Commission of India (1987b). The judicial vacancies across high courts for the year 2017–18 are presented in Fig. 1. The sanctioned judge strength of a court is the sum of the working judge strength and vacancies. For example, Delhi has 25 judge vacancies and a working strength of 35, against a sanctioned judicial strength of 60. These numbers are important and concerns therein need to be addressed.====There exists a gap in terms of analysing the performance of different levels of Indian judiciary and suggesting reforms based on the results of performance evaluation. The present work aims to study the relative efficiency of Indian high courts using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The efficiency of high courts of India has not been studied and published so far to the best of our knowledge. Thus, this study is the first of its kind that analyzes their efficiency (based on DEA) and ranks the courts accordingly. The study also aims to analyse the impact of workload on the judicial efficiency of the courts. We also try to determine if the court is efficient with respect to incoming cases or the overall caseload (sum of cases pending at the beginning of the year and number of cases instituted during the year), and study the impact of including pending cases on efficiency. This would enable the decision makers in the judicial system understand the specific area where the court is lagging and needs attention. Accordingly, appropriate reforms can be developed and implemented.====The rest of this paper is organized in the following sections: Section 2 gives an overview of the Indian judicial system and possible impacts of a weak judiciary. Section 3 gives a review of literature on DEA and its applications. Section 4 presents the proposed DEA models and results. Section 5 presents the learnings and policy implications from this study.

This paper conjectures that ==== stance may be one of the determinants of antidepressant use. Panel data estimates for 19 ==== countries for the period 1997–2017 show that the coefficients of income per capita, unemployment rate, and the share of household debt in disposable income are positive and statistically significant in explaining antidepressant use. As an extension, the study focuses on the role of various unemployment measures and shows that all of these significantly and positively contribute to antidepressant use. The study concludes that controlling the rise in antidepressant use requires both improved ==== governance, and stricter rules and regulations for their prescription.","Antidepressants, initially developed in the 1950s, are psychiatric medications for the treatment of depressive disorders.==== All available data show that their use significantly increased over the last decades, especially in high income economies. In the United States, for example, the use of antidepressants among those aged 12 and over increased from 7.7 percentage in 1999–2002 to 12.7 percentage in 2011–2014, implying that one person in eight was using antidepressant over the past month during the period (Pratt, Brody, & Gu, 2017). The alarming increases in antidepressant use have also been reported for other high-income countries, e.g., the United Kingdom (Martín-Merino, Ruigómez, Wallander, Johansson, & García-Rodríguez, 2010), Italy (Guaiana et al., 2005), the Netherlands (Huijbregts, Hoogendoorn, Slottje, van Balkom, & Batelaan, 2017), Australia (Mant et al., 2004) and the Nordic countries (Rosholm, Andersen, & Gram, 2001; Vilhelmsson, 2013).====The rise in antidepressant use cannot be only attributed to the treatment of depressive disorders; antidepressants are increasingly prescribed for treating non-depressive conditions, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain and, in some cases, snoring, migraine, addiction, and sleep disorders, cf., Olfson et al. (2002) and Olfson and Marcus (2009). Another reason was the substantial increase in prescription of antidepressants by non-psychiatrists without a clinical psychiatric diagnosis, cf., Mojtabai and Olfson (2011). OECD (2013, 2015) also agrees that the increase in antidepressant consumption is partly due to their prescription for a wider range of conditions, and argues that there is a need to evaluate the appropriateness of prescription patterns, and the availability of alternative treatments in high consumption countries.====The medical and psychiatric literature suggests that lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater mental health problems (Ansseau et al., 2008; Jenkins et al., 2008; Lorant et al., 2003, 2007; Richardson, Elliott, & Roberts, 2013). Several studies in this literature have examined the relationship between SES and antidepressant prescriptions and revealed that low SES was significantly related to higher rates of antidepressant prescription (Andersen, Thielen, Nygaard, & Diderichsen, 2009; Grunebaum, Oquendo, & Manly, 2008; Hansen et al., 2004; Raymond, Morgan, & Caetano, 2007; Von Soest, Bramness, Pedersen, & Wichstrøm, 2012). Several studies in the economics literature clearly show that low income, unemployment, financial strain, and indebtedness have detrimental effects on psychological wellbeing (Bridges & Disney, 2010; Caroli & Godard, 2016; Catalano et al., 2011; Hojman, Miranda, & Ruiz-Tagle, 2016; Sweet, Nandi, Adam, & McDade, 2013; Zimmerman & Katon, 2005). These few studies, however, do not directly focus on the relationship between macroeconomic variables and antidepressant use, but rather on the relationship between SES and depression. In this study, which is to our knowledge, one of the first in economics, we focus on the macroeconomic determinants of antidepressant use. Our aim is to determine the role of four major macroeconomic variables, namely real GDP per capita, the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, and the household debt ratio in antidepressant use in OECD countries over the years 1997–2017. We hypothesize that all contribute positively to antidepressant use, although GDP per capita and the other three have opposite connotations. Higher unemployment rate, inflation rate, and household debt ratio all carry a negative connotation; an economy with one or more of these macroeconomic imbalances may trigger antidepressant use by causing mental health disorders, including depression, mood disorder, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, eating disorders, chronic pain, etc. On the other hand, a higher GDP per capita has a positive connotation. We conjecture that higher GDP per capita triggers antidepressant use by means of facilitating access.====The details of our model are as follows. We use fixed effects panel data analysis to determine whether the four macroeconomic variables have any role in explaining antidepressant use. Fixed effects model is preferred (and also econometrically verified) as the sample of countries are presumed similar in fundamentals as members of OECD. In addition to major macro variables, we used several control variables, ranging from education level to political stability, in order to increase the estimation power of our analyses. The results show that the coefficients of real GDP per capita, the unemployment rate, and the household debt ratio are statistically significant and positive, supporting the hypothesized role of macroeconomic variables on antidepressant use. The results also show that all coefficients of control variables are statistically significant in explaining antidepressant consumption in OECD countries. As an extension, we repeated the basic model with different unemployment rates classified with respect to education level, age, and sex. Our motivation for focusing on various measures of unemployment is the strong effect of the estimated coefficient of unemployment rate on antidepressant use that was found in the estimation of our basic macroeconomic model.==== We again show that the coefficients of real GDP per capita, the household debt ratio, and the classified unemployment rates are statistically significant and positive.====Some pronounced conclusions of our analyses are as follows. The first is that higher GDP per capita, unemployment rate, and household debt ratio stimulate antidepressant consumption. Second, opposite to our a priori expectation, the inflation rate appears to have no role in explaining antidepressant consumption. Third, antidepressant use is a greater problem for the educated. Finally, the effects of macroeconomic variables become almost indistinct among the elderly population. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The next section describes the data, discusses the methodology, and presents the results. The last section concludes the study and discusses the policy implications of the results.",Macroeconomic determinants of antidepressant use,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300880,29 July 2020,2020,Research Article,197.0

Our results underscore the importance of policy coordination among different government bodies to design an appropriate macroprudential policy, especially in the current context of the Covid-19 crisis."," studied the effects of macroprudential policy on the growth in credit and housing prices, while ==== constructed an index representing macroprudential policy to analyze its effect on credit growth. ==== analyzed the impacts of macroprudential policy on cross-border bank flows. ==== investigated the effects of the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on economic growth, whereas ==== explored the effects of the LTV ratio on private lending, and ==== found that a reduction in the LTV ratio leads to a greater demand for rental accommodation. ====In the current global turmoil of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, macroprudential policy can be one of the most important macroeconomic policy tools to avoid an economic crisis morphing into a financial crisis. During crisis time, there is a common concern that there could be large capital outflows from emerging markets and developing economies, which could lead to liquidity pressures in domestic or foreign currencies in the corporate and banking sectors. This can create maleficent feedback in particular where exchange rate depreciations are large and currency mismatches common. If the Covid-19 crisis is more protracted, the real estate sectors are also likely to be strongly affected, which could in turn potentially lead to amplification from falling asset prices. In this circumstance, deployment of macroprudential policy or capital flow measures (capital control) is now actively discussed among policymakers.====In this paper, we have two policy-oriented research questions. The first policy question is about the relationship between macroprudential policy and the probability of a banking crisis. Does macroprudential policy affect the probability of a banking crisis? To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have analyzed the effects of macroprudential policy on the probability of a banking crisis. Part of the reason is that it is difficult to collect comparable data on macroprudential policy across countries.==== This is because macroprudential policies include different types of policies and because they differ across countries. Recent analyses show that macroprudential policies have primarily targeted the housing sector, especially in advanced economies (====).====This paper attempts to overcome this difficulty by using a novel macroprudential dataset recently published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (====). This database contains levels of LTV ratios across countries, and its coverage is the broadest to date. Specifically, it covers 134 advanced and developing countries from 2000 to 2016. We use this new database to study the effects of macroprudential policy on the probability of a banking crisis.==== is also applicable to the banking crisis because it is based on the theoretical model of ==== that predicts the occurrence not only of currency crises but also of banking crises.====The second policy-oriented research question is about the effectiveness of macroprudential policy in relation to other macroeconomic policies, including monetary policy, ====, and capital controls. How does macroprudential policy complement or counteract other macroeconomic policies to influence the probability of a banking crisis? For policymakers, this is worth researching because as we elaborated in the second paragraph of this introduction, there is feedback among macroprudential regulations, monetary policy, exchange rate regimes, and capital account restrictions.====Recently, the complementarity between monetary policy and macroprudential policy has been studied frequently (====; ====; ====). It is known that macroprudential easing can usefully complement monetary policy by reducing the effects of the adverse shock on output and credit. Macroprudential relaxation can remove regulatory constraints which impede transmission of monetary policy accommodation, and enhance the ability of monetary policy to support economic activity. When the authorities need to tighten monetary policy to limit the inflationary effects of an exchange rate depreciation, macroprudential relaxation can help reduce potential stresses from monetary tightening. However, this relationship between macroprudential policy and macroeconomic policy has not been studied so far in the context of the probability of a banking crisis. In addition, what about the relationship of macroprudential policy with other policies such as capital controls and exchange rate regimes from the viewpoint of crisis probability? There is little research so far that has explored this topic. Thus, we study the roles of macroprudential policy for preventing the banking crisis in relation to the above-mentioned other related macroeconomic policies.====Our main findings are summarized as follows. In a nutshell, a tighter macroprudential policy is found to lower the probability of a banking crisis. Namely, we found that a tightening of the LTV ratio is statistically significantly associated with a lower probability of a banking crisis through a ====, as we envisage from the proper objectives of macroprudential policy. We also find that other macroeconomic policies do indeed matter for the effectiveness of macroprudential policy. Specifically, our findings show that changes in the LTV ratio are effective in influencing the probability of a banking crisis in countries that have inflation targeting regimes, floating exchange rate regimes, and/or no capital controls. For policymakers, these are new important empirical findings regarding the probability of a banking crisis that the extant literature has not obtained before.====Our findings contain meaningful and practical policy implications. For example, our findings indicate that countries that have capital controls and/or fixed exchange regimes may not expect the significant impact of macroprudential policies on crisis prevention compared to countries without capital controls and/or with floating exchange rate regimes. The policymakers and regulatory authorities should be cautious about drawing lessons about macroprudential policy from other countries because the effectiveness of macroprudential policy is very different if other countries have different monetary policy frameworks, exchange rate regimes, or capital account restrictions. Therefore, our main message is that policymakers need to take into account other macroeconomic policies when they design macroprudential policy for reducing the likelihood of banking crises. In other words, the policy coordination among different government agencies could be essential to conducting macroprudential policy effectively.====This paper is structured as follows. In the following section, we review the relevant literature on banking crises and macroprudential policy. Next, we explain our empirical methodology and data to estimate the effects of macroprudential policy on banking crisis probability. Subsequently, we show our baseline estimation results based on the probit model and robustness checks using different binary choice models. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between other types of macroeconomic policies and macroprudential policy from the banking crisis probability perspective. Other macroeconomic policies studied in this paper include the monetary policy frameworks, exchange rate regimes, and capital controls. Finally, we conclude our analysis with policy implications.",Macroprudential policy and the probability of a banking crisis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300867,6 July 2020,2020,Research Article,198.0

As the room for conventional monetary policy quickly eroded, other non-standard/unconventional forms of monetary policy were implemented. It is obvious that monetary easing in advanced economies has the potential to affect the economies in neighboring countries. Indeed, there has been a broad discussion about the possible negative effects of the unconventional monetary policy of the ECB and the Fed on small open economies after the introduction of such measures. Monetary policy easing in the advanced economies may have stimulated significant capital inflows and exchange rate appreciation, thereby threatening external competitiveness. In addition, some of these flows could have fueled credit and asset price booms, amplifying financial fragilities. Cheap external funding also has an impact on exposures to foreign currency-denominated debt on domestic balance sheets. These effects can also spill-back to the country of origin, which can lead major central banks to augment their policy functions to include global variables or other factors that account for potential feedback loops.====Empirically, these issues can be addressed in a multi-country model that is able to take into account the economic links between the countries of interest. As such, the global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model proposed by Hashem M. Pesaran and co-authors (Garrat, Lee, Pesaran, & Shin, 2006; Pesaran, Schuermann, & Weiner, 2004) has been widely used in the literature (Chudik & Pesaran, 2016). It provides a coherent way to model contemporaneously a set of countries taking into account their interactions through trade and financial linkages. The early literature using multi-country models and euro area monetary policy made the simplifying assumption of complete homogeneity of effects on euro area countries using aggregate data (see e.g., Dees, di Mauro, Pesaran, & Smith, 2007). Several recent studies have pointed out that both conventional and unconventional monetary policy affects euro area countries differently, though. For example, Cavallo and Ribba (2015) and Dominguez-Torres and Hierro (2020) use a near VAR and find that effects vary significantly between different monetary clusters within the euro area. Dominguez-Torres and Hierro (2020) also note that differences arise depending on the type of instruments used, with more common effects for the period of quantitative easing and more heterogeneity prior to 2008. Huchet (2003) attribute the different response of euro area countries to common monetary policy shock to asymmetric responses to tightening and loosening. Georgiadis (2015) and Burriel and Galesi (2018) use the GVAR methodology and provide evidence for cross-country heterogeneity of responses to conventional (Georgiadis, 2015) and unconventional (Burriel & Galesi, 2018) monetary policy effects. Cross-country heterogeneity in their studies can be partially explained by differences in financial structures, labour market rigidities and industry specialization.====In this paper we propose a novel way of dealing with common monetary policy in a multi-country framework. We employ a GVAR model with two hierarchies of dis-aggregation for euro area countries. On the aggregated level, we select variables that are common to all euro are countries, namely a measure of monetary policy and the euro dollar exchange rate. To account for potential heterogeneity of the monetary policy effects we include macroeconomic data for each euro area member separately. We then propose a way that uses sign restrictions on both the common and the euro area specific variables and yield shocks that are consistent between both levels of aggregation. Using these euro area consistent shocks, we test for the existence of spillovers to neighboring countries, especially to those from the CESEE region. We also examine whether these consistent shocks transmit either through direct (trade and financial) links to the euro area, or (trade and financial) exposure to third countries. Our results point to considerable regional heterogeneity both within the euro area and between neighboring countries. For the euro area, our analysis reveals clusters of countries that go beyond a simple core-periphery distinction. For CESEE economies, we find significant and negative output and price effects, with the latter being comparably weaker. This might be related to higher import prices after a depreciation of local currencies against the euro.

Our models are able to explain three quarters of countries’ choices of MPF, and there is no obvious systematic pattern in the prediction errors: that suggests that changes in fashion such as the rise in popularity of inflation targeting are of limited importance.====For policymakers interested in choosing a monetary policy framework there is also a long-established normative literature on the pros and cons of fixed versus flexible exchange rates (e.g. Ghosh, Gulde, & Wolf, 2002), and a smaller literature on, for example, the preconditions for adopting inflation targeting (e.g. Batini & Laxton, 2007).

Between the early 1980s and the late 1990s, the average import tariff fell by half, from around 20% in 1980 to 11% in 1999 (Martin, 2003). The same process has continued more recently, with average tariffs declining by half during the first decade of the 21st century, reaching 5% by 2014 (UNCTAD, 2016). The effects of this profound shift have been the subject of much research and debate. The aim of this paper is to synthesise the results from computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, regarding the impact of trade liberalisation on income poverty and inequality.====CGE models possess a number of advantages for assessing the distributional impacts of trade liberalisation. Compared with simpler partial equilibrium models, they are much better placed to address the economy-wide effects of trade reforms, particularly on wages and employment, which are argued to determine the overall impact of liberalisation (Hertel & Reimer, 2004; Naranpanawa, Bandara, & Selvanathan, 2011). They also avoid the problems associated with cross-country econometric approaches, including selection bias, impact heterogeneity, and the difficulty of disentangling the effects of multiple policy reforms introduced simultaneously (Chen & Ravallion, 2004; De Melo, 1988; Dollar, Kleineberg, & Kraay, 2016). Although CGE models are often criticised, due to their complexity, or the sensitivity of results to particular modelling assumptions, they are still considered to be an important component of the ‘tool-kit’ that economists use to assess the distributional impacts of economy-wide policy reforms (Bourguignon & Silva, 2003; Bourguignon, Bussolo, & da Silva, 2008).====What then have we learned about the distributional impacts of trade liberalisation from CGE models? The answer to this question is not immediately clear, for two reasons. First, although there have been several reviews of this literature, there has not yet been a ==== review, designed to synthesise all the available evidence, in a transparent and replicable manner (White & Waddington, 2012). For example, Hertel and Reimer (2004) review around 30 studies using CGE modules to assess the poverty impacts of trade reforms, but stress that their review is “not exhaustive” (Hertel and Reimer, 2004: 4).====Second, previous reviews have focused mainly on methodological issues, and have as a result left some interesting questions unanswered. For example, how large are the effects of trade liberalisation on poverty and inequality, according to CGE models? It is fairly well known that standard CGE models typically show quite small gains from trade in the aggregate: the ‘right signs’ but the ‘wrong magnitudes’ (Bussolo & Whalley, 2003). However, small aggregate gains can still hide significant distributional changes (Rodrik, 2018), and so it remains to be seen whether CGE models also predict relatively small changes in poverty and inequality. Going beyond averages, by how much do the estimated impacts of trade liberalisation on poverty and inequality derived from CGE models vary, and what accounts for this variation? While there are various potential sources of heterogeneity – for example, different characteristics of the countries analysed, different types of CGE models, different measures of inequality, and so on – it remains to be seen which (if any) of these factors is able to account for the heterogeneity in results we see in practice.====In this paper, we carry out a systematic review of the literature using CGE models to simulate the effect of trade liberalisation on income poverty or inequality. We then assess the reasons for the observed heterogeneity in results, using meta-regression analysis (MRA). This technique has been widely applied to the results from econometric studies (e.g. Li & Beghin, 2012; Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2012), but it has been used much less for the results from CGE models. The only examples of which we are aware are Hess and Von Cramon-Taubadel (2008), who use MRA to explain variation in estimates of the aggregate welfare gains from multilateral trade liberalisation, and Freire-Gonzalez (2018), who uses MRA to explain variation in estimates of the effects of environmental taxation. Although the welfare outcomes and the precise nature of the policy experiment on which we focus are different – for example, we focus on unilateral as opposed to multilateral trade liberalisation – our paper otherwise follows a similar approach.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses possible sources of heterogeneity in the results from CGE models which we explore further in the meta-regression analysis. Section 3 then describes the inclusion criteria used to define the scope of the review, and the search procedure used. Sections 4 and 5 then present the results of the synthesis and meta-regression analysis, while Section 6 discusses the implications of the results for policy and further research.",The impact of trade liberalisation on poverty and inequality: Evidence from CGE models,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300752,23 June 2020,2020,Research Article,201.0

Deviations from a safe level of debt should be watched over in order to take corrective measures. In this paper we make a proposal for an operational characterization of the “prudent debt level”. To do so, we use standard methods based on Vector ==== to compute the probability that the public debt ratio exceeds a given threshold, using the Spanish case as an example. The resulting probabilities are highly and positively correlated with market risk assessment, measured by the spread with respect to the German bond. Our estimation of the “prudent debt level” is obtained as the debt-to-GDP ratio that maximizes the correlation between the probability of passing a pre-specified debt threshold and the spread. The so-obtained implicit debt threshold or “prudent debt level”, which is consistent with the medium-term debt-to-GDP ratio anchor of 60% of GDP, presents several advantages as a complement to existing DSA toolkits.","The current debate regarding the reform of the fiscal and financial architecture in the euro area has highlighted the necessity to characterize the level of public debt beyond which a given country would be more vulnerable and/or subject to a higher level of fiscal stress and market scrutiny.==== On the one hand, gauging such level is necessary to determine the conditions upon which a country can officially borrow from international institutions.==== On the other hand, the creation of an euro area-wide safe asset requires the knowledge of a country-specific public debt threshold that allows to divide the level of sovereign debt into different tranches, according to their implicit risk.====The existing tools available to address these issues present some limitations. First, the Stability and Growth Pact establishes a debt-to-GDP threshold as a medium-run reference value. While this is a key figure in anchoring the medium-term objectives of public finances, it does not (at least a priori) reflect the economic fundamentals of each country. Second, tools based on Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) are crucial to assess the soundness of public liabilities. While their use is widely spread amongst international institutions, these tools have become under recent scrutiny since they do not incorporate in a systematic way certain risks to public debt such as those arising from contagion effects or liquidity runs.====This paper proposes a new estimation of the “affordable” or “prudent” public debt level that aims to address the issues noted above. Contrary to an arbitrarily-designed threshold, our measure is firmly based on the fundamentals affecting the debt dynamics, which may not be homogeneous across country members in the euro area. And, importantly, our estimation of the prudent debt level relates these economic fundamentals to market expectations, hence incorporating information about how changes in investor's sentiment can affect the sustainability of debt.====In order to empirically investigate the relevance of our proposal, we estimate the prudent debt level for the case of Spain, a paradigmatic example of the tensions in the sovereign debt market observed in the euro area during the last decade. Indeed, despite the fact that the country enjoyed a comparatively low public debt level within the euro area in general over most of the recent crisis (and more so within the group of peripheral countries) (see Panel A in Fig. 1),==== it was subject to distinctive market pressure since 2009 and was routinely grouped among “high-debt countries” by the international economic press.====Our exercise starts by estimating a Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model that incorporates all the variables determining the dynamics of public debt following the government budget constraint. We use the estimated VAR to construct a large number of Monte Carlo simulations of potential paths of public debt. Since we incorporate new information in the VAR in a sequential manner, we are able to retrieve time-varying probabilities that characterize the expected behavior of debt in some quarters ahead (e.g. we can estimate the probability that the debt-to-GDP reaches a level of 60% in 10 years). The evolution of these probabilistic objects has very similar dynamics to measures of market risk assessment, such as the spread between the Spanish and German 10-year bonds. In light of this fact, we compute our measure of the prudent debt level as the implicit debt threshold that maximizes the correlation between our probabilistic objects and the measure of market expectations. Our results suggest that for the case of Spain, this level would be approximately 54% (relatively close to the 60% reference value of Europe's Stability and Growth Pact).====From an operational point of view, our empirical estimations can complement standard DSA tools in different ways. On the one hand, the finding that our measure of risk is highly correlated with the sovereign spread raises the issue of the utility of the former in real-time monitoring, given that the latter, at the end of the day, is available on a daily basis. In this respect, we argue that the advantage of complementing the standard analysis with the probability measures we compute is twofold. First, it is a measure based on fundamentals, and thus not subject to market volatility. Second, we show that our measures Granger-cause the information contained in the spread, and thus, in a sense, do contain advanced information that is only reflected in the market measures with some delay. On the other hand, monitoring the evolution of our estimated prudent debt threshold can be a useful complement of standard tools, to the extent that variations in this threshold may reflect changes in the market perception of the fundamentals determining debt sustainability.====Our paper presents strong policy implications. The debt threshold that maximizes the correlation with the spread can be viewed as the one that shapes market participants expectations about the evolution of public finances and then as a market-based index of debt sustainability. As such, this does not imply that debt reaches its “maximum affordable” level, as defined by the fiscal limit (i.e., “...the point beyond which taxes and government expenditures can no longer adjust to stabilize the value of government debt...”, Leeper & Walker, 2011), but rather that the debt ratio enters in a region in which the degree of vulnerability of public finances becomes high, possibly with an associated non-negligible probability of debt becoming under stress so that the price of bonds drops dramatically to allow for a risk premium. In that sense, this debt threshold is more associated to the lower limit of the probability distribution of the fiscal limit itself, beyond which the debt ratio displays a small but non-negligible probability of reaching the fiscal limit, thus triggering a non-linear response of the spread (Bi, 2012). To this extent, our measure of a prudent debt level could shed light on the aforementioned issues related to the reform of the fiscal and financial framework in the euro. In particular, it could provide useful information that i) can help determining the borrowing conditions of countries that apply for financial aid, and ii) allows to determine a level of sovereign debt below which the market considers repayment to be less risky, and hence facilitate the creation of a senior tranche that could serve as a euro-area safe asset.====This paper relates to the empirical and theoretical literature that suggest that a country-specific “affordable” or “prudent” public debt level exists, beyond which a given country would be more vulnerable and/or subject to a higher level of fiscal stress and market scrutiny.==== Rational markets should be able to assess the evolution of fundamentals and thus impose tighter debt limits on countries with weaker and/or more volatile fundamentals, in particular with lower mean GDP growth rates or higher economic volatility.==== One particular branch of the latter literature discusses the main determinants of the maximum level of debt that a country can afford without defaulting, as well as the non-linear behavior of financing costs once the debt-to-GDP ratio of a country approaches that level.====Not surprisingly, the idea of a “prudent” government debt level has also been touched upon by the literature dealing with the analysis of public debt sustainability. In particular, Garcia and Rigobon (2004) and Polito and Wichens (2011)==== combine the Value at Risk approach with the estimation of the correlation pattern of the macroeconomic determinants of public debt dynamics by means of Vector Auto Regressions (VARs). These estimated VARs are then used to compute the probability of the public debt ratio being higher than a given threshold, by means of Monte Carlo simulations. By doing so they study to what extent the computed time-varying probabilities are able to correctly predict the dynamics of the stock of public debt over some quarters ahead, with the aim of checking whether they may act as an early warning indicator of the compliance of the public debt level with some reference value, like EU's 60% Maastricht criteria. Our paper is linked to the last piece of the literature. Nevertheless, we move one step forward and analyze the correlation of the probability-type measures defined in the previous paragraph with market risk assessment, as captured by the sovereign debt spread.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the evolution of public debt in Spain in the past few decades and provide some stylized facts.

Critical work is concerned not only with equity issues, but also with presenting alternative policy visions and corresponding acts. The Education Reform Act (ERA) passed by the Conservatives in 1988 represented the most comprehensive legislation on education in Britain since 1944. It included a number of policies that took a much more decisive step towards marketisation within education. This marketisation encompasses a combination of parental choice and school autonomy along with a greater or lesser degree of public accountability and government regulation. The successor government, the New Labour government, took these elements of competition and central control much further. While this government introduced some modifications to the approach of its predecessors, a consensus would be that the continuities were more pronounced than the discontinuities (Glatter, 2012). In fact, “there has been a strong continuity in education policy across Conservative and New Labour governments since the late 1970s” (Whitty, 2008: p. 178). This consensual political culture, in turn, has made school autonomy, a key policy of ERA, followed by a series of marketisation policies introduced by the two parties and even intensified by the Coalition government go further towards “school commercialism” (Molnar, 2005). Unsurprisingly, this change has evoked visible concerns. As Gunter (2015: p.4) stated:====“…[I]n this sense, the major change that I am concerned with here is not so much the restructuring and reculturing of education through neoliberalism, but the depoliticisation process. What I mean here is a shift of decisions about and for education away from arenas of debate (Parliament, Local Councils), political decision-making (Ministers, Local Officials), and experts, experience and evidence (Teachers, Researchers) towards corporatised solution packages designed and enacted by consultants within and external to government, and the normalising of everyday beliefs (increasingly faith based) that are exercised beyond challenge”.====Perhaps even worse, some similarity has also been observed in other regions, such as East Asia, which simply borrowed school autonomy policy (You & Morris, 2015). Thus, examining the way school autonomy policy would be further implemented by the current government, whose role we think should be deflected from the “depoliticisation” process with respect to governmental behaviour as well as school management, makes global sense in light of other recent education policy analyses (e.g., Annabi, 2017; Bhatnagar & Bolia, 2019; Ferraroa & Põder, 2018).====In this regard, this paper adds two main contributions to the existing literature. First, whereas most existing literature is qualitative (e.g., Higham & Earley, 2013; Whitty, 2008; Wiborg, 2015), we are the first (to our knowledge) to use a quantitative approach to confirm that there is a remarkable cross-party consensus on school autonomy policy in England. We do so using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) with a local election dataset, directly addressing the classical question posited by Downs (1957) regarding whether some degree of policy “compromise” is brought by partial convergence. In the English context, our causality analysis finds that the Labour party moved toward the rightest position starting in the mid-1990s until about 1997, and it ended up with an education policy preference quite similar to that of the Conservatives. This finding was previously discovered only through textual analysis (see Bara & Budge, 2001). Second, based upon our convincing methodology that overcomes the identification problem of partisan policy effects (see Imai & Shelton, 2011), we attempt to stress how the current government should respond to balancing school autonomy and central control in the education policy-making process by shifting from “depoliticisation” to “repoliticisation” (Wood & Flinders, 2014). Current policy will be improved through the government’s ideological preference and school management pathways.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.

Existing evidence suggests that the harmonisation of standards to international benchmarks reduces compliance costs and is less trade-inhibiting, or may even be trade-promoting. This paper thus investigates how the regulatory margin in food standards affects Africa’s fish exports to the EU. We measure the regulatory margin in standards by comparing EU standards to the international scientifically-formulated benchmarks. Our results indicate that, relative to the international standards, EU fish standards are indeed non-inhibiting. Thus, the high number of fish exports from Africa rejected by the EU due to non-compliance with EU standards does not really suggest that the measures are overly restrictive but rather is an indication of the poor quality of Africa’s fish exports. This finding suggests a need for upgrades to Africa’s fish export quality, especially the fish supply chain infrastructure, through continuous improvements in fish export logistics facilitation and export promotion measures.","As tariffs have been negotiated down, non-tariff barriers – particularly food safety standards are becoming increasingly important in agricultural food trade. Along with this reduction in the use of tariffs, outbreaks of disease and a number of major food crises and food hazards in the 1980s and 1990s led to increased proliferation and stringency of food safety standards in international trade and in the food supply chain (Unnevehr, 2003). Standards have thus emerged as an increasingly powerful tool for ensuring the safety of food. In fact, about 60% of world trade in food-related products is affected by at least one of these standards (Cadot & Gourdon, 2016), underlining the key role they play in international trade.====Food standards are measures imposed on agricultural products to ensure plant, animal, wildlife and human health and safety, and usually have a scientific justification based on a risk assessment (WTO, 2015). Theoretically speaking, it has been posited that standards can have both trade-promoting and trade-inhibiting effects. Their advantages and disadvantages for international trade have been widely documented in the literature. On the one hand, standards may be a catalyst for international trade as they increase the value of certified products and processes by providing consumers with vital information and assurances about their health and safety (Blind, 2004); thus, they can trigger a higher demand for imports. On the other hand, standards can constitute a barrier to trade since compliance is costly; they impose excessive costs on producers and exporters, particularly in developing countries, which lack the necessary infrastructure needed to fully meet these standards (Czubala, Shepherd, & Wilson, 2009; Maskus, Otsuki, & Wilson, 2005; Kareem, Brümmer, & Martinez‐Zarzoso, 2017).====For instance, a World Bank study finds that the average investment costs required to comply with standards could be up to 124% of firms’ sales for Sub-Saharan Africa, 44.1% in the Middle East and 13.36% in Latin America (Maskus et al., 2005). By affecting the price of the product, such costs can result in the erosion of export competitiveness and affect the profitability of the export product, thereby distorting trade. Aside from the cost implications, there are concerns that standards can also be used for protectionist purposes, particularly when such standards are more restrictive than would be required to optimize social welfare (Gandal & Shy, 2001).====Food standards are imposed to achieve the desired level of safety; compliance can therefore ensure increased market access to the importing countries. However, the imposition of standards can result in trade restrictions as non-conforming products are rejected at the importing countries’ borders (Baylis, Martens, & Nogueira, 2009). In particular, the EU has rejected a significant number of food imports due to exporting countries’ non-compliance with EU food standards. In total, there were 9233 incidences of rejected imports at the EU border between 2008 and 2013 (RASFF, 2014). This number includes many African countries whose exports have been rejected at the EU border. For these countries, the most frequently rejected export product category is fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates, representing about 29% of Africa’s total exported products rejected at the EU border between 2008 and 2013. This percentage corresponds to 447 cases out of the total of 1102 incidences of rejection corresponding to African exports in the period. Furthermore, out of the 1548 cases of fish and fish products rejected by the EU between 2008 and 2013 from all countries, Africa accounts for about 40.6%. This high incidence of border rejections indicates that non-compliance with EU standards poses a significant and costly market access problem for Africa and needs to be addressed. In addition to the loss in export earnings, the costs of being rejected at the border include losses of transport and insurance. Furthermore, such rejections may also tarnish the reputation of exporting countries and negatively affect their competitiveness (Baylis et al., 2009).====This study is therefore motivated by the market access challenge facing African fish exports at the EU border due to the EU’s rejection of many Africa’s fish and fish products for non-compliance with EU standards (c.f. Kareem, 2016). While the challenge encountered in penetrating EU markets may result from the prohibitively high compliance costs of meeting EU food standards, it may also stem from EU standards being overly more stringent than those required by the international (harmonised) standards. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) allows national standards to differ from international standards. However, international harmonised standards are less costly to comply with than national standards, and the former might be less trade-inhibiting or even trade-promoting (Disdier, Fontagne, & Cadot, 2015). Indeed, with harmonisation trade benefits accrue to exporting countries as they pay only one adaptation costs to access foreign markets. Since firms incur a single cost of compliance, trade costs are lower, promoting economies of scales and increasing export market penetration (Chen & Mattoo, 2008).====In contrast, standards not harmonised to international ones can have cost-increasing effect as they increase adaptation costs for foreign producers since they have to adjust their production processes to meet the different individual standards of their trading partners. In addition, the costs of demonstrating conformity to multiple standards lowers their cost competitiveness (Moenius, 2006). In other words, high trade costs may fall disproportionately on African firms if they have to meet different standards at the EU markets than for other export markets, thereby putting them at a disadvantage. A fragmented system would prevent African firms from achieving economies of scale as the compliance costs paid to access the EU would be different from those paid other access other markets. Thus, the ==== between the EU standards and the international standards will determine the burden of standards on these exporting firms.====In this paper, we empirically investigate whether EU food standards for fish products are more restrictive than the corresponding international Codex==== Alimentarious Commission (hereafter Codex) standards, using trade data from 2007 to 2012 for a sample of 27 EU and 40 African countries. In particular, we determine whether the increased ‘====’ between national and international harmonised standards might be more trade-distorting. We measure the regulatory margin of the standards by comparing EU food safety standards to the international scientifically-referenced benchmarks formulated by both the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). Our choice of the fish trade is based on the fact that these products are subject to a relatively high number of standards compared to other products, due to their highly perishable nature. In addition, they are the most frequently rejected African exports at the EU border, constituting over 40% of all cases of fish exports refused entry into the EU (RASFF, 2014).====Our study makes two distinct contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, we investigate whether the stringent EU standards are relatively more trade-inhibiting compared to an international benchmark. We do so in light of concerns that standards can also be used as a protectionist tool (Xiong & Beghin, 2014). With the notable exception of Xiong and Beghin (2014), empirical investigations into the degree of protectionism of standards, due to the difficulty and complexity of measuring the stringency of standards and the lack of an acceptable globally-recognised benchmark (Li & Beghin, 2014). Secondly, we make a methodological contribution by consistently estimating the trade impact of standards when zero trade flows are frequent, most likely due to the high stringency of standards, which prevent exporters from exporting to the EU. The dataset for Africa is somewhat peculiar in terms of missing data and or missing trade, which necessitates the comparison of different estimators. We therefore apply several of the most recommended techniques to compare the performances of the different estimators in order to provide policymakers with unbiased and consistent estimates that can be used in future trade negotiations with the EU. Methodological rigour is crucial here so as not to distort the information provided to policymakers; an inappropriate estimation approach may lead to biased, possibly misleading results that could strain established trade relationships between trading partners.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

It illuminates current industry demands and helps to improve service firms’ operations through fewer developmental gaps and stronger policy and strategy. Further, an influential network relationship map (INRM) and influential weights can unravel the complex assessment system and prioritise industry improvements. The results demonstrate that upgrades must occur first to the industry, then to promoting of investments, and lastly, in developing exports. Finally, the practical implications for managing service firms have been discussed.","The service industry refers to a market- or demand-oriented industry. Recent literature indicates that the service industry incorporates culture, technology, and innovative ideas into products from primary and secondary industries, creating high value and market-value products (Gelderman, Semeijn, & Bruijn, 2015; Selviaridis, Agndal, & Axelsson, 2011; Selviaridis, Spring, & Araujo, 2013).====With Taiwan’s maturing economic development, the service industry as well as the service trade itself have gradually gained importance. However, given the limited demand from Taiwan’s domestic market, its service industry’s potential expansion is constrained. Therefore, a pivotal impetus involves how to promote the internationalisation of Taiwan’s service industry and open overseas markets. Although internationalisation will intensify competition in Taiwan’s service industry, it will also attract foreign investments, technology, and increase employment. Hence, the government and businesses should become familiar with developing trends in Taiwan’s service industry under the country’s volatile international environment to cultivate a superior, more prosperous service industry and enhance its competitive advantage.====The global economy experienced substantial political and financial issues in 2018, such as the United States-China trade war, financial fluctuation among emerging markets, and geopolitical conflicts. However, according to economic forecasts released by IHS Markit, an international forecasting organisation, the 2018 growth rate maintained a level of 3.2%, while the growth rate in 2019 was projected as 3%, with emerging countries as a major source of growth. Therefore, Taiwan’s government should consider political and economic global developments in generating steady and healthy domestic economic growth by removing investment barriers, fostering a more accommodating legal environment, implementing plans for innovative development of its industry, and deepen relationships with countries listed in its New Southbound Policy.====The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics in China’s Executive Yuan has noted that the production value of Taiwan’s service industry reached NTD 9.98 trillion in 2017, or 63.36% of total GDP The commercial service industry—including wholesale and retail, transportation and warehousing, and accommodations and catering services—is the most important branch, as its production value reached NTD 3.59 trillion, or 22.51% of total GDP. The service industry accounted for 59.3% of all employment; more specifically, commercial services—such as the wholesale, retail, catering, and logistics sectors—comprised nearly 60% of the industry’s contribution. Therefore, the service industry is crucial to both the economy and employment in Taiwan, regardless of whether the production value or the employed proportion of the population have been observed.====With the development of an intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) and 5==== ====G technology, consumers can understand the service industry better through the integration of information. Enterprises can also create more precise operations and marketing strategies as the rising green economic trend allows enterprises to benefit from saving energy, and fulfil their roles as world citizens. As an emerging economic entity close to Taiwan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations possesses a large middle-class, young consumers that can propel the economy’s rapid growth. Hence, the key to the success of the service industry involves grasping crucial market opportunities and seeking new niches.====The multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) method has been rarely used to examine the service industry’s business strategies. Cheng and Krumwiede (2010) explored how market orientation affects a firm’s service innovation and its performance. These findings indicated that customer-oriented firms are more likely to incrementally adopt service innovations; in contrast, competitor-oriented firms are more likely to adopt radical service innovations (Kazakov, 2016). Further, Muzamil Naqshbandi and Idris (2012) examined 254 firms from 9 different service industries to not only explain the components of competitive priorities among Malaysian service firms, but also discover different competitive priorities and how they change across low- and high-performance service industries. Lee and McKibbin (2018) proposed an empirical general equilibrium model to assess the service sector’s productivity and economic growth in Asia based on historical experience. They find that the faster growth of productivity in Asia’s service sector has contributed to sustained, balanced Asian economies. Tan, Zhang, and Khodaverdi (2017)) used the data envelopment analysis and balance scorecard methods to evaluate both efficient and inefficient levels of service performance. The study results identify that dealers are inefficient in learning about customers’ growth, which helps them transform from inefficient into efficient. Further, other methods in previous studies—such as structural equation modelling—do not consider the cause-and-effect relationship between indicators or a decision model that could simplify the evaluation process (Tsai & Lin, 2016; Zhao, Tsai, & Wang, 2019). In summary, an important topic in literature involves the issues in evaluating the service industry’s performance. Service industries must know how to manage their service business strategies, as its success depends on its management, business strategies, and government policy. This study focuses on how such firms can implement their service business strategies, more effectively, to enhance their competitiveness. Therefore, this study proposes the IEK model—which includes industrial upgrading (I), developing exports (E), and promoting investments (K)—to create an evaluation system to assess and provide strategies for enhancing competitiveness in Taiwan’s service industry.====Developing a service business strategy involves multiple-attribute decision-making (Dalvi-Esfahani, Niknafs, Kuss, & Nilashi, 2019; Yang & Lin, 2017). A complex decision-making tool, MADM involves both qualitative and quantitative indicators. In recent years, most MADM methods have been suggested as valuable ways to determine best strategies (Lu, Tzeng, Cheng, & Hsu, 2015; Tsai & Chang, 2013). Several studies have also used MADM methods and applications to solve problems in areas such as wealth management (Chang & Tsai, 2016), tables PC (Tsai & Chang, 2013), Social==== ====+==== ====Local==== ====+==== ====Mobile (SoLoMo) marketing services (Yang & Lin, 2017), and social media addiction (Dalvi-Esfahani et al., 2019).====Therefore, the current study uses hybrid MADM methodologies to explore the cause-and-effect relationships among various dimensions and criteria to enhance competitiveness in the service industry, and ultimately, to suggest the best improvement strategy for service firms (Dalvi-Esfahani et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2015; Tsai & Lin, 2016). This study creates a service business-evaluation model based on MADM methods that integrates a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) analysis to create an influential network relationship map (INRM). The influential weights of a DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) in dimensions and criteria derived from the influential relationship matrix and weightings from a modified ==== (m-VIKOR) analysis, to assess and integrate the criteria of gaps, are discovered. Subsequently, methods to reduce the gaps in improvement in evaluating the service industry’s competitiveness based on our INRM (Lu et al., 2015; Tsai & Lin, 2016; Zhao et al., 2019) were explored. Our MADM models overcome the limitations of existing decision models, and can be utilised to help analyse the indicators that influence the improving of Taiwan’s services in the real world (Lu et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2019).====The study presented in this paper has been structured as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review to create the service business evaluation framework. Section 3 provides a brief introduction of the MADM method as well as our DEMATEL, DANP, and m-VIKOR analyses used to build a service business evaluation model to assess and improve the service industry’s competitiveness. Section 4 illustrates an empirical case of improving and developing competitiveness in Taiwan’s service industry to demonstrate the proposed service business evaluation model; the results are then discussed. Finally, Section 5 concludes, and provides limitations and implications for future study.",Strategic evaluation criteria to assess competitiveness of the service industry in Taiwan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300715,15 June 2020,2020,Research Article,206.0
Matchaya Greenwell C.,"Senior International Researcher –Economics, Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research, International Water Management Institute, Pretoria, South Africa","Received 12 October 2019, Revised 18 March 2020, Accepted 26 May 2020, Available online 8 June 2020, Version of Record 16 December 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpolmod.2020.05.002,Cited by (8),"The purpose of this paper is two-fold: firstly, it examines the relationship between public agriculture expenditure and agriculture sector growth, and secondly, it examines the heterogeneous effects of expenditure on agriculture growth depending on which subsectors within agriculture receive the investments. The co-integration analysis results offer insights into a number of issues: (i) it is found that agricultural expenditures are important for agriculture sector growth in Malawi, Eswatini (Swaziland) and Zambia and (ii) that within the agricultural sectors, investing in research and development, subsidies, and in neglected areas (livestock, fisheries) alongside crops can expand the agricultural sector more. Policy makers should increase public spending in agriculture but should also emphasize on improving intra-sectoral allocations, targeting areas that create sectoral growth.","At the Maputo Summit in 2003, African Union Heads State agreed to invest larger shares of their national budgets (they set a target of 10%) in the agriculture sector in order to spur agricultural led growth (NEPAD, 2003). The understanding was that huge investments of public resources in agriculture would result in an increase in the growth of the agriculture sector which would in turn reduce poverty directly or through other pathways because agriculture has strong backward and forward linkages. The commitments made at that Maputo Summit were re-echoed at the Malabo Summit in 2014 (AUC/NEPAD), thereby underscoring the importance that African leaders placed on the agriculture sector as an engine of economic growth and poverty reduction. Since the Maputo Summit in 2003, the issue of the relationship between public expenditures in agriculture and agriculture value added growth has stimulated a lot of interest. Key policy makers within the African context often wonder if and how agriculture expenditures and agricultural sectoral growth are related. In fact, the fact that since 2003 when African Heads of State committed to investing 10% of their annual budgets to agriculture, very few countries invest closer to 10% of their total expenditures in agriculture relates to the paucity of evidence on the importance of expenditures in growth the agriculture sector as well as the economies.====The purpose of this study is two-fold. Firstly it examines the relationship between agricultural spending and agricultural sector growth. Secondly, it seeks to understand which areas within agriculture should be prioritized in order to grow the sector more. These are important policy questions with potential to guide the African policy maker. These issues are key considering that many of these agricultural sectors are in stagnation and associated with low growth rates.====Although studies on this topic are hard to find within the Southern African context, there are several studies that have studied related issues. For example, there have been studies on defence spending and economic growth in Paksatan (Shahbaz, Afza, & Shabbir, 2013), budgetary allocation and economic in Nigeria (Oyinbo, Abdulsalam, & Zibah, 2013), government expenditures and economic development in developing countries (Samudram, Nair, & Vaithilingam, 2008) and in Greece, the UK and Ireland (Loizides & Vamvoukas, 2005) among others. Within the area of health, there have also been many studies that attempt to explain the effect of public expenditures on health outcomes including infant mortality rates. For example, Akinlo and Sulola (2019) found that government health expenditure had a positive impact on infant mortality rate, perhaps indicating that resources were being stolen through coruption. There are almost no studies available tacking the specific question of the relationship between economic agriculture growth and agriculture spending growth.====An understanding of the true nature of the causative process between government spending on agriculture and agriculture value added will help determine the robustness of the estimated relationship and has important policy implications. Should the causality be of Wagner law type (Wagnerian is the thinking that economic growth determines expenditure) (see Ram, 1987), the estimates derived would cast doubts on the importance of public spending on agriculture sector growth. By contrast, if the causality were Keynesian (where expenditures are considered key for economic growth), knowledge of the precise causative process has important policy implications. For example, if the causality were Wagnerian, public expenditure would be relegated to a passive role, if Keynesian, it acquires the status of an important policy variable (Loizides & Vamvoukas, 2005).====The study focusing on expenditures in the UK, Greece and Ireland by Loizides and Vamvoukas found that the size of government was co-integrated with economic growth in the long-run. This finding in essence supports the Keynesian School of thought in macroeconomics which suggests that government spending accelerates economic growth. Government expenditure in this case is considered exogenous factor that changes aggregate output. Evidence to corroborate this hypothesis is mixed (see Loizides and Vamvoukas, 2005, Landau, 1983, among others). In general, econometric tests of this hypothesis, either in the form of standard regression analysis (for example Ganti & Kolluri, 1979; and Georgakopoulos & Loizides, 1994) or within the Error Correction Model framework (Kolluri, Panik, & Wahab, 2000), have yielded results that differ across and within countries.====Exploring the relationship between expenditures and Gross National Product (GNP) for the case of a developing economy, Samudram et al. (2008) found that there was a long run relationship between expenditures and GNP (conforming Keynes view) and that there was Ganger causality of the Wagnerian nature in that it run from GNP to expenditures. Certain expenditures, including Defense and Health had a two-way relationship with GNP implying that GNP benefited from expenditures, whereas expenditures too, benefitted from GNP (Samudram et al., 2008). Some studies have shown that there is a positive influence by government expenditure on economic growth (Holmes & Hutton, 1990), while others including Landau (1983) and Barth, Keleher, and Russek (1990) have shown that the relationship between expenditure and economic growth is negative. Papagni et al. (2019) studying the relationsip between public investment and growth in Southern Italy using co-integration analysis found a positive effect of public investment on per unit of labour output but further found that the impact varied over time.====Note that while the literature on this topic is diverse and studies find mixed results across time and space (Loizides and Vamvoukas, 2005), the literature on the specific issue of expenditures on agriculture and agriculture value added growth is almost non-existent. Thus, the current study contributes to this literature not only by its focus on the Southern Africa, where such studies are non-existent, but also by focusing on the specific issue of agriculture expenditures agricultural sector growth and the most less researched issues of intra-sectoral resource allocation.====An Auto-regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is employed later in the analysis. In the first step, the orders of integration of variables are assessed using the Philip-Perron unit-root test. In the second step, the ARDL framework and the bounds test proposed in Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001) are employed to examine whether agriculture sector growth and public expenditures are co-moving in the long-run. Using the ARDL model to test for co-integration is in line with Manamperi (2016), who studied millitary expenditires and economic growth in Greece and Turney using the ARDL approach to co-integration, citing its advantages.====As highlighted previously, the ARDL framework used in this study has two important advantages over the error correction models and cointegration methods proposed by Engle and Granger (1987), and Johansen and Juselius (1990). In the first place, the order of integration of the explanatory variables can be a mixture of zero or one (====(0) or ====(1), respectively). Second, previous studies found that the bounds test for cointegration was super-consistent for small samples (Mah, 2000), which is good for our present case where the sample is just under 30 observations. Mah (2000) also stated that the traditional cointegration methods, namely the Engle–Granger and Johansen–Juselius methods are not reliable for studies with small samples. The implication is that the bounds test provides more robust results for studies with small or limited data, which proffers a great advantage to developing countries where data are in general a major limitation. To our knowledge, studies on public expenditure on agriclture and agriculture sectoral growth are scant in Southern Africa and this study provides value in this area. Further, application of the ARDL to agriculture expenditure data for African countries replete with limited data issues is non-existent, which implies that this study is a good contribution to literature in this respect as well.====The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2, a brief review of the Malawi, Zambia and Swaziland economies is provided. In Section 3, the methodology and data used in this study is discussed.

The intensity of the impact of the Control of ","In economic science, in the last thirty years, there has been a strong increase in researchers’ interest in discovering the causes of institutional differences between countries, understanding the key transmission mechanisms of institutions’ performance on the quality of individual macroeconomic performance. The key message of most research is that improving the quality of institutions (through institutional reform policies) has a stimulating effect on investment, innovation, and economic growth. Analysts are particularly interested in the identification of the feedback of cause and effect relationships between the quality of institutions and economic growth, which knowledge may be relevant for the competent modeling of economic and social development policies. The results of numerous studies have increasingly moved towards emphasizing the positive impact of institutions on economic growth and development, and also in confirming that economic development leads to qualitative institutional and broader progressive social change. The ability of institutions to adapt to the changing economic situation (through institutional development and reform policies), and to develop new rules and habits for conducting transactions, shapes the ability of economies to continue to grow. Thus, not only are institutions important for the efficient functioning of an economy at any given time, but they also need to change over time to create the impetus and rules that new markets and technologies require (Bruinshoofd, 2016, Masuch et al., 2017, Bartelt et al., 2013, Docquier, 2014, Helgason, 2010, Dixit, 2009). The impact of institutions on stimulating economic activity and reducing uncertainty is most often explained by the effect of institutional factors formalized through the concept of rule of law, political stability and low levels of corruption (Corrado and Rossetti, 2018). Among other things, a high corruption index negatively influences FDI inflows or, in the worst case, it is superseded by the wrong kind of FDI (by organized crime), (Costa, 2010). The perception of the political, economic and social climate personified through the efficiency of institutions is of great importance in creating an enabling environment for investment and growth. In addition to the existing mobility of international capital, measuring, that is, assessing and evaluating the incentives of the environment can play an important role in determining a country's ability to attract and retain domestic and foreign investment (Salvatore, 2009). The subject of this paper is to examine the quality of institutions as drivers of economic growth in the Western Balkan countries (referred to as WB countries hereafter) in the period 2006-2016. WB countries have hardly ever been mentioned in studies of the impact of institutions on economic growth, as well as in the key messages of such research. This may be due to the relatively low availability of data from these countries, and especially their poor comparability with data relating to some other European countries that completed the transition process and became members of the European Union in 2004 (Dang, 2009).====WB countries are late in the process of accession to the European Union due to numerous causes, subjective and objective. The farthest along the path of EU membership are Montenegro and Serbia, which have been in the accession process since 2010 and 2014 respectively. Northern Macedonia and Albania have reached a decision to open accession negotiations in 2020. Bosnia and Herzegovina signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement in 2015.====The primary objective of this paper is to identify, on the basis of the developed impact model of the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators, those institutions that are critical to growth dynamics and, in this light, to identify policies that need to be implemented to enhance growth. The definition of treating the five WB countries as a single entity is justified in our view, since these are small countries with similar levels of economic development, with very similar historical and cultural characteristics. Moreover, until 1990, all but one (Albania) were part of the same country (Yugoslavia). In addition, these are countries with low levels of rule of law, characterized by high perceptions of the prevalence of corruption, in which the public administration is highly politicized and the media are not sufficiently free. Finally, it is realistic to assume that in all WB countries it is imperative to impose a policy of ending institutional reforms in order to ensure market conditions for the economy. In this sense, we believe that the results of the research can be a clear indication of the direction in which public policy makers in these countries should act, that is, they represent a useful suggestion to public authorities on which areas to pay particular attention to the implementation of institutional reform policies. The process of policy modeling is understood as theoretical and / or empirical research work, supported by different knowledge, quantitative and qualitative models and techniques, which analytically investigates the past (causes) and future (effects) of various activities of public authorities acting on desirable social flows, at different times and in different places (Estrada, 2011, 544). The content of the category of institutional reform policies in this research is primarily economic and, more specifically, institutional reform, whose implementation has a stimulating effect on economic growth. Of course, one should not lose sight of the fact that economic per se is not a guarantee of social prosperity, but it is a necessary condition for social development. In other words, when talking about economic growth, we mean the necessary but by no means sufficient assumption of social progress.====The composition of the paper is structured in the following way: After the introduction, section 2 presents a theoretical framework for research based on the WGI (The Worldwide Governance Indicators) methodology of the World Bank (WGI project, n.d.) and in particular its modification made by the author to look at the impact of institutional development on the economic growth of the analyzed group of countries over the 2000-2016 period. Section 3 is devoted to empirical research and discussion related to the research findings obtained. Section 4 summarizes key messages that can be sent to policy makers for more institutional reform in WB countries, as well as policies to support investment and encourage innovation in them, based on the results of the research conducted. Section 5 presents concluding considerations.====We should be aware of the fact that analysis of indicators and correlations of institutions and economic growth can serve as a roadmap for determining direction, but it cannot be a recipe for achieving economic efficiency.

This phenomenon demands several policy considerations. Is India ready for it? In this perspective, the paper investigates the impact of a higher level ","The world is experiencing a reduction in the average family size with higher economic development. For instance, the average household size in Australia (or France) has fallen from 4.5 (or 3.1) in 1911 (or 1968) to 2.53 (or 2.3) in 2006 (or 2011). The literature (e.g., Adams, 2010, Bongaarts, 2001) argued that the decline in family size is a consequence of increasing urbanization, industrialization, and educational expansion which are all part of higher economic development. Recently, this phenomenon, comprised with higher economic development, is also being experienced by developing countries such as India.====While the Indian economy witnessed an average growth rate of 7.4% per year between 2001 and 2011 through a transformation from an agriculture-based economy to industry/service based urban economy (Tripathi, 2013), the average family size declined from nuclear to single. While the total number of Indian households increased by 29 percent, single-person households have increased by about 35 percent between 2001 and 2011. Though the number of nuclear families has increased from 135 million in 2001 to 172 million in 2011 the percentage has remained almost the same at 70%, which is quite higher. This could be the reason for inadequacy of housing availability in urban areas for working couples choosing to live with other family members for support. Census data also shows that 56% of households in urban India had four or fewer members in 2011. This indicates that family size in India is reducing.====Fig. 1 clearly shows that a decreasing trend of average household size in India is mostly from 1991, the year when India started to liberalize its economy for higher economic development. The average number of urban household size has reduced more sharply than rural household size. This phenomenon could be attributed to an increasing rate of higher education, different location of jobs from home, and increasing urban economic pressure.====Now the question arises, whether a nuclear family is better or a joint family. There are some associated positive and negative effects. Nuclear families provide full freedom of decision making to a couple and encourage interdependence amongst them. On the contrary, joint families can provide financial help, emotional help, and a sense of community. Most importantly, the problems in child-rearing, marital conflicts, and helplessness during illness can be avoided by living in a joint family. The increasing number of divorces, separation, depression, and anxiety among Indians could be the reasons for lowering of the household sizes in India.====In this paper, we mainly deal with two important issues. First, we use rigorous quantitative analysis to test statistically whether higher economic development is responsible for the reduction in average family size in India or not. We find evidence that higher economic development reduces family sizes in India. We consider several social, economic, and religious variables to assess the relationship. This exercise provides us a clear picture of the factors which are responsible for a reduction in household size and associated with higher economic development. This helps us to prescribe policies to the government for avoiding the negative consequences of reduction in family sizes, so that we can utilize the highest benefits of economic development. And this stands as the main purpose and supplemental goal of this paper.====The higher level of development is measured in several ways such as; the rate of urbanization, educational expansion, economic pressure, improvement in infrastructure, level of national income, poverty rate, the extent of inequality, and several other variables that depict the development process. In addition to that, as different religious and social groups in India play an important role in various government decisions, we have also considered them in our study. We use both cross-sectional and panel data models to estimate the impact of development on average household size in India from the period of 1991 to 2011. The study period from 1991 is chosen as India started its economic reform from 1991. The study has been conducted by considering aggregated (i.e., all India state level) and disaggregated levels at the household level separately. Data have also been used at aggregate and disaggregate levels. Aggregate level data at India/rural/urban level is sourced mainly from the Census of India, whereas household-level data is taken from unit-level data of National Sample Surveys (NSS) on consumption expenditure in 2011–12.====The paper adopts the following structure. The next section reviews the related literature to find out the research gap. Section 3 introduces model, data as well as the estimation strategy. Section 4 examines the impact of higher economic development on average household size by using several econometric models and discusses the results.

Based on the results of the ARDL, we find that a 1% increase in per capita total biomass energy consumption causes a 0.65% reduction in per capita total energy CO====.","The average global temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.17==== ====°C per decade since 1970 (National Centers for Environmental Information NCEI, 2017). This is troubling and not sustainable. The Paris Agreement in 2015, adopted by 195 countries, aims to limit the total average global temperature rise to no higher than 2==== ====°C compared to pre-industrial levels by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in stages.==== To meet the requirement of the Paris Agreement, some countries introduced programs or policies to control and reduce GHG emissions. In 2011, the European Council and Parliament, for example, established a long-term plan to reduce GHG emissions in the European Union (EU) by 80–95% below 1990 levels by 2050 (Scarlat, Dallemand, Monforti-Ferrario, & Nita, 2015). In the US, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, originated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, is a national policy that requires a minimum volume of renewable fuel to reduce both GHG emissions and the quantity of petroleum-based transportation fuel.==== To expand the use of renewable fuels, the RFS was extended as RFS2 by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The RFS2 increases the size of the program by increasing mandated biofuel production to 36 billion gallons by 2022; no more than a maximum of 15 billion from corn-based ethanol and a minimum production requirement of 16 billion gallons from cellulosic biofuels.====Bioenergy is considered one of the major renewable energy sources and an alternative to from fossil energy since it is renewable, abundant, and infinite. Among bioenergy sources, biofuel has received a great attention as an alternative to reduce both GHG emissions and dependence on petroleum fuels (Bildirici, 2012, Goswami and Choudhury, 2015). Due to increasing bioenergy use, the production of bioenergy, especially for crop-based biofuels including ethanol and biodiesel from corn, sugarcane, soybean, and palm oil, has accelerated the global expansion and intensification of agriculture. These activities, however, have adverse economic and environmental impacts, such as increased food price volatility and expanded production on fragile agricultural land (Foley et al., 2011). Specifically, crop competition between the food and energy sectors may lead to higher fluctuations in food price. In addition, new agricultural lands converted from forests, degraded forests, or grasslands lead to negative environmental consequences (Gibbs et al., 2010). According to Marshall (2011), an increase in agricultural land use releases additional carbon into the atmosphere, since forests and grasslands are carbon sinks. Converted agricultural land emits 351 metric ton of GHG (CO==== equivalent) per hectare (Searchinger et al., 2008).====Biomass bioenergy, a renewable energy source made from biomass, is produced from non-food materials including wood, agricultural residue, waste material, animal manure, and human sewage (Hohenstein & Wright, 1994). Contrary to crop-based bioenergy, cellulosic biofuel, which is a biomass-based biofuel, can be produced from primary resources such as crop residue, wood residue, and municipal waste. Thus, its production does not require additional agricultural lands to produce more bioenergy. Furthermore, biomass bioenergy provides a clean, low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels that is available from locally available resources (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2012). With a rapid increase in biomass energy consumption and the relative environmental advantage of biomass relative to crop-based biofuel, many studies have investigated the causal relationship not only between biomass consumption and economic growth (Aslan, 2016, Bildirici, 2012, Bildirici, 2013, Bildirici and Özaksoy, 2013) but also between biomass consumption and total energy CO==== emissions (Bilgili, 2012).====Although many developed countries experience positive environmental consequences from modern biomass energy, no study has examined the causal linkage between biomass energy consumption, CO==== emissions, and economic growth in the US. This is an important topic because resolving these relationships could drive environmental and energy policies. This study attempts fill a void in the literature of biomass consumption by investigating the causal relationship between total biomass consumption, total energy CO==== emissions, and real Gross Domestic Production (GDP) in the US utilizing quarterly data from the period January 1973–December 2016. To be specific, we investigate the contemporaneous causal relationship between biomass consumption, total energy CO==== emissions, and real GDP in the US by utilizing the directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the result of the DAG, a direction of causality between the variables, we employ the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method to investigate the long-run causal relationship between the variables. Finally, we test the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, which suggests an inverted U-shape relationship between environmental quality (total energy CO==== in this paper) and economic development (real GDP in this paper).====Findings from this paper contribute to the existing literature in two ways. First, we provide the causal effect of biomass consumption on total energy CO==== emissions based on two different concepts: long-run Granger causality and contemporaneous causations. Second, this study provides evidence of the EKC hypothesis, since a growing body of literature in terms of CO==== emissions, energy consumption, and GDP illustrate mixed results on the EKC hypothesis.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews and connects the study with the previous literature. Section 3 describes the data and methodology.

Nevertheless, lower average GDP growth and the prolonged era of very low interest rates have led observers such as Larry Summers, 2014, Summers, 2016 to argue that the U.S. is in an era of “Secular Stagnation,” a term coined by Alvin Hansen in 1938. This characterization has generated calls for more government spending stimulus.====In this paper, I suggest that the U.S. is not in a new era of secular stagnation. I first review what Alvin Hansen meant by secular stagnation and demonstrate that the current U.S. economy does not satisfy those conditions because it is now experiencing full employment and normal levels of investment.

The most prominent case is the Trump Administration's tariffs on imports from China but also from other countries, resulting in tariff retaliation by China but also by other countries. The tendency, however, is more general. According to Global Trade Alert, restrictive trade policy interventions have exceeded liberalizing trade policy interventions worldwide in every year since 2009, although the gap between the two aggregates was largest in 2018–19 (Fig. 1).==== The United States, unsurprisingly, tops the list of countries ranked by number of trade-restricting measures over the decade. Rounding out the top ten are India, Russia, Germany, the UK, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, France and China, in descending order. The point being that the movement toward more restrictive trade policies extends across time and space even if the U.S.–China trade war grabs the headlines.====For several years – since the Trump Administration's January 2018 imposition of 30-to-50 per cent tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, the March 2018 imposition of 10-to-25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum, and the subsequent imposition of tariffs of 25 per cent and higher on a range of Chinese goods – analysts have been warning of serious macroeconomic consequences. According to Davies (2018), a global trade war “would administer a negative shock to world GDP of perhaps 1–3 percentage points in the next few years”; moreover, “there is a downside to the distribution that could turn out to be much worse.”==== Simulations using the IMF's Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model suggest that a permanent 10 percentage point increase in U.S. tariffs on imports from all other regions would reduce the level of real GDP by about 1 per cent for the U.S. and one-third of 1 per cent for the rest of the world.==== Given the basic linearity of the model, the effects of a 25 per cent tariff would be roughly two-and-a-half times as large, and retaliation would make the negative impact correspondingly greater. In a follow-up paper using this same model, Berthou, Jardet, Siena, and Szcerbowicz (2018) simulate the impact of a 10 percentage point increase in tariffs on all imports by all countries. They find that global GDP falls by up to 2 per cent in the first year and by 3 per cent after 2 years.====But while the tariffs have materialized, the serious macroeconomic damage has not – at least not yet. Global economic growth has slowed, but only slightly, from 3.6 per cent in 2018 to 3.0 per cent in 2019 and 3.4 per cent in 2020, according to the latest estimates in the IMF's ==== at the time of writing.

Addressing the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Buenos Aires, his words packed a punch: “Too often members seem to believe they can gain concessions through lawsuits that they could never get at the negotiating table,” he said in his opening statement (Lighthizer, 2017a). Ominously, he continued that “we have to ask ourselves whether this is good for the institution and whether the current litigation structure makes sense.”====Less than three months later, the Trump administration published its first official ====, which laid out America's grievances with the WTO's system of settling disputes.==== Alongside procedural complaints, the USTR dossier listed policy areas in which the administration insisted WTO jurists got their legal decisions wrong. A rules-based system was all very well, but only if its arbiters could be trusted to stick to the rules members had agreed to. And as far as Lighthizer was concerned, that trust had been broken.====Over the following two years, the Trump administration acted on its concerns, refusing to approve members of the WTO's Appellate Body and effectively hobbling the organization's system of resolving disputes. By the end of December 10, 2019, there were too few arbiters left to do their job, which meant that either side of a trade dispute could appeal to a nonexistent Appellate Body and send the case into legal limbo. In effect, the Trump administration ended the WTO’s 25-year-old system of resolving trade disputes (Keynes, 2019).====This article explains how and why we arrived at this point. The United States has long insisted on the flexibility to defend itself against politically problematic imports, driven by the demands of industries such as steel. The creation of the WTO involved a compromise that was supposed to curtail one type of defense, notably voluntary export restraints (VERs). But over time a series of WTO legal decisions made it harder for the United States to use other tools that it thought it had negotiated to keep. Simmering discontent reached the boiling point under the Trump administration. Policy decisions shifted to personnel like Lighthizer, who harbored both longstanding hostility toward the WTO and a deep familiarity with the desires of import-sensitive industries such as steel.====The WTO rules do allow for safeguard tariffs, countervailing duties, and antidumping duties, all of which are designed to slow or stop imports that are surging, subsidized, or underpriced. But other members have repeatedly accused the United States of applying these sorts “trade remedies” overzealously. And so for over 20 years, the US government sent teams of lawyers to Geneva to defend itself against their complaints. In the list of objections the USTR published in its ==== of 2018, one section stood out: “Defending US Trade Remedy Laws at the WTO.”====In the end, US policymakers argued that too much of the flexibility they needed had been taken away.

We discuss the importance of the WTO as a multilateral forum to negotiate rules on segments of trade expected to grow in the future such as services and digital trade. We describe how the history of negotiations in the WTO provides useful insights for negotiations on such future topics.,"This is a challenging moment for the multilateral trading system — probably the most challenging in its history. Despite contributing to an unprecedented era of global prosperity and peace over the past seven decades, the system seems increasingly at risk. Trade tensions are rising, rules are under strain, and the dispute settlements system has been called into question. Just when the system is most needed to provide a secure and stable foundation for today's interdependent global economy, it is most fragile. Current assessments of the economic ‘costs’ of a weakened or marginalized multilateral trading system—and of the rise of more fractured, regionalized and inward-looking trade landscape—tend to focus the direct economic impact of rising tariff and not-tariff barriers on global trade flows. It is argued here that these assessments fundamentally underestimate the risks posed by a weakened WTO because they do not take into account all of the indirect—but critically more important—economic benefits or “global public goods” that flow from a shared, rules-based system. These benefits include more transparent and informed economic transactions, more secure and predictable economic relations, more cooperative or “win–win” economic outcomes, and, perhaps above all, more open exchanges of ideas, information and knowledge—including knowledge about how to better manage economic interdependence itself. Indeed, it is often forgotten that the multilateral trading system was constructed in response to the Second World War—and was rooted in the idea that restoring global peace depended on restoring global prosperity. The rise of today's increasingly integrated, digitalized, and multi-polar global economy makes the underlying rationale of the multilateral trading system more, not less, relevant. No doubt measuring the economic value of an open, secure and cooperative global trading system—like measuring the economic value of traffic lights—is hardly an easy task. But this does not alter the fact that the main value of the WTO—and the real risk of its deterioration—lies in cooperation and conflict avoidance, a value that goes well beyond a simple calculation of rising or falling trade costs.====The following article develops this broad argument in three distinct but related sections. First it provides a brief overview of the evolution of the WTO and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. It points out that the system's steady growth has been a response or adaptation to real world trade and foreign policy challenges—and that its ever widening and deepening has been a result, as much as a cause, of countries’ increasing desire to cooperate on trade and a growing acknowledgement that their national economic interests are increasingly bound up in their collective interests. This section also suggests that if advancing or updating the WTO is proving challenging it is still worth doing. The article then proceeds to provide a summary of the role of trade in economic growth and development, and then provides an overview of the ways the WTO has contributed to a well-functioning global trading system. We also attempt to succinctly address some of the myths many non-experts hold about how the organization operates and what it achieves.",The Value of the WTO,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300429,19 April 2020,2020,Research Article,214.0

They suggest either continued low growth or a financial correction or both, and argue for strong interventions in the economy now to forestall or reverse these daunting outcomes. Interestingly, these varied diagnoses for the recent behavior of the U.S. (and in some cases global) economy have in common a similar prescription: investment. Whether to raise productivity growth or overcome secular stagnation, greater investment, while not viewed as a panacea by any means, is part of the vision for an improved future outlook.

The link from investment today to future output relies on several links: first, gross investment today becomes the capital of tomorrow, after subtracting depreciation; second, there is both physical “fixed” capital and newer, more quickly growing, forms of “intangible” capital, and finally, we consider private versus public investment. There has been substantial change in the last few decades in each of these links. With regard to private capital, the change is mostly in the composition of investment and the capital stock.

Further integrated equity and bond markets will provide access to capital funding improve the allocation of capital, help mitigate market and systemic risks, and ultimately foster a counter-cyclical, sustained real economy growth. The paper provides evidence that the increases in both total portfolio equity and debt to GDP ratios in the euro area actively contribute to real GDP growth.","The integration of capital markets in the European Union (EU) has increased considerably since the inception of the euro in 1999. Nevertheless, the EU markets are still considered to be too fragmented, too heterogeneous and un-synchronized for supporting investment and economic growth. In addition, the regulatory support is un-coordinated and insufficient for channeling savings into productive allocations (Bhatia et al., 2019). Savers as well as portfolio investors and businesses in Europe have been dependent too heavily on national banking systems (Pagano et al., 2014). Consistently, the home bias of financial sectors in the EU countries has been too excessive, mainly due to the country-based, un-coordinated national sector regulations (Artis & Hoffmann, 2012).====Recognizing the insufficient use of capital markets for mobilizing the large pool of existing savings toward investment and economic growth, the European Commission enacted the Capital Markets Union (CMU) initiative in September 2015 and updated it with a set of more specific guidelines in June 2017. The general objective of CMU is to provide European companies and investors with diversified sources of financing that will ultimately foster investment, innovation and real economy growth (Allen & Pastor, 2018; Bhatia et al., 2019; Demertzis, Merler, & Wolff, 2018). Moreover, deeper financial integration is essential for subsequent monetary convergence (European Central Bank, 2018). It will help the EU member countries mitigate systemic risk and avert potentially destabilizing shocks (Orlowski & Tsibulina, 2014).====A guiding hypothesis of this paper is that a deeper integration of capital markets is necessary for fostering economic growth in the EU. More integrated and resilient capital markets are arguably essential for achieving financial stability, mitigating systemic risk and supporting a counter-cyclical, sustained economic growth in Europe. The paper aims to provide supporting arguments for advancing the integration of capital markets by showing a positive impact of increased equity and debt financing on the real GDP growth in the euro area. For comparison, a similar analysis of causal effects is carried out for the United States.====The paper discusses the main advantages of integrated financial markets that have been identified in several recent studies (Allen & Pastor, 2018; Bhatia et al., 2019; Quaglia, Howarth, & Liebe, 2016; Sapir, Véron, & Wolff, 2018).

This production function captures the efficiency of investment in producing GDP, and is summarized in one parameter which is commonly called the ==== or ICOR. Lower values of the ICOR, say between 2 and 10, indicate that the return on investment in terms of GDP is good. When the ICOR reaches levels above 20, the resulting return of GDP is marginal and for very high ICORs as in the case of Italy, the return is negligible. The growth rate for a period is derived by dividing the average share of investment in GDP by its corresponding ICOR. In our models we used the revised UN national accounts estimates to find the ICORS of each of the 27 countries in the group. The August 2019 Eurostat revisions (see Appendix A) for 2016, 2017 and 2018 were used to revise the UN estimates. The ICORs were estimated by regression using the following specification:====, where ==== covers the period of estimation.====The ICOR is equal to 1/====.====We computed the average investment share over the 2009 to 2018 period and the resulting growth rate was used for projecting GDP. Since each country was extrapolated individually, we had to add the GDPs over the entire group of 27 countries to arrive at a GDP for the EU27. We then computed the yearly growth rates of GDP which are shown in Fig. 1. As Fig. 1 shows, the EU27 as a group had rather wide swings in the growth rate until 2010, but after 2010 the growth rate increased each year was very low until 2018.====Table 1 then shows the average growth rates for the period 2009 to 2018 for each EU member country and for the EU27 as a whole. We also show the parameters for the Homar-Domar model for each country included in EU 27, namely the ICOR and the average investment share in GDP. With the exception of Greece, all EU27 member countries had investment in GDP ratios around 20%. This is typical for developed countries. However, the difference in growth rates among the countries is attributed to the efficiency of investment in producing increases in GDP. The higher the ICOR, the slower the growth. When we sort the ICORs we find that the upper quartile is about 19 and the lower quartile is 7.3. The average quartile for the group as a whole is 13.9. This suggests three scenarios which should bracket the most likely outcome for the period 2020 to 2030.====Let the baseline scenario be parameters shown in Table 1; that is, the countries will be projected between 2020 and 2030 on the same potential growth rate path that they had from 2009 to 2018. An optimistic scenario would be that the countries with ICORs above the upper quartile will manage to lower the ICOR incrementally to 19 during the 2020 to 2030 period. The other countries will continue as in the baseline. This should give a boost to the aggregate growth rate of the EU 27. The countries that would be incrementally decreasing their ICOR under this scenario are Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, France, Italy and Portugal. Italy would be the country which would have to make the largest adjustment to its ICOR of the group. In this case, it is the ICOR and not level of investment which prevents Italy from growing.====A pessimistic scenario, on the other hand, would be to raise the ICOR incrementally over the period 2020 to 2030 of all countries that are below lower quartile, i.e., 7.3. Once again leaving the other countries on the 2009 to 2018 potential growth path. When 2030 finally arrives the EU27's GDP growth rate should be bracketed between these two scenarios. The countries whose growth rates will be lowered under this pessimistic scenario are Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Romania. The results for EU27 are shown in Fig. 2 below. Our simulations show a very gradual adjustment to the aggregate growth rate of the EU27 because of the incremental change in the ICOR which is spread over ten years. However, policies which could improve the ICOR (or which make it worse as in the pessimistic scenario) would make the changes appear in a shorter time.",Why does Europe grow more slowly than the United States?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300478,14 April 2020,2020,Research Article,218.0

Using an annual panel of macroeconomic data for 151 countries over 1963–2014, we find that tariff increases are associated with an economically and statistically sizeable and persistent decline in output growth. Thus, fears that the ongoing trade war may be costly for the world economy in terms of foregone output growth are justified.","The economics profession is strongly in favor of free trade, but economists have not always done a great job convincing the public and politicians that trade should be free. The economists’ case for free trade is primarily based on: (a) theoretical models of comparative advantage; and (b) empirical evidence, mostly microeconomic, that suggest losses in economic efficiency and welfare from protectionism. But popular debates often focus on headline aggregate figures such as GDP, and what is largely missing from the literature is empirical macro analysis. Accordingly, in this paper we ask whether aggregate data are informative on the costs, if any, of raising tariffs.====The little literature we found does not fill us with confidence that the macroeconomic data will strengthen the professional economist's case. Despite the renewed interest on tariffs, recent studies have mostly concentrated on micro analyses for a handful of countries. The aggregate evidence by and large seems dated, and not particularly compelling; many of the empirical papers tended to find small macroeconomic effects. We were not deterred however, since most studies seem narrow. Bringing to bear more data, covering longer time periods and more countries, might allow us to obtain more precise estimates, and make better inferences about the size of macroeconomic effects. Thus we embarked on a data collection exercise, covering over 150 countries, and more than a half-century of data to tackle our basic question: does an increase in import tariffs boost the size and growth of the aggregate pie (GDP) or shrink it, and if so by how much?====Our efforts in this paper are thus focused on going back to basics—collecting data on tariffs across a wide country and time coverage, and estimating the impact on output using standard empirical-macro methodologies. Our objective is to paint a broad macroeconomic picture, based on traditional macro approaches and covering a large number of countries over a broad span of time, something that is missing in this discussion. As it turns out, our results suggest that using an extended database with substantial country and time coverage, does indeed deliver the goods.====Using aggregated annual data for 151 countries (34 advanced and 117 developing) over 1963–2014, we find that tariffs have economically- and statistically-significant adverse effects on output growth. The impact is persistent and increases with the magnitude of the tariff change. Our baseline econometric model suggests that a one standard deviation increase in the tariff rate (corresponding to a 3.6 percentage points) leads to about a 0.4% decline of output five years later. The estimated decline in output seems related to reduced efficiency in the use of labor across sectors, an appreciation of the real exchange rate which hampers competitiveness (and undercuts possible improvements in the trade balance), higher imported input costs which raise production costs, and intertemporal effects as anticipated tariffs bring forward consumption and output, only to see these macro variables collapse once the tariff is actually imposed. These different channels are fleshed out in a companion paper (Furceri et al., 2019); here, we focus mainly on the headline response of GDP growth.====Overall, our results provide a consistent first set of evidence on the macroeconomic costs from raising import tariffs. Moreover, the costs we identify are likely to be a lower bound on the costs of protectionist policies more generally, as the costs of nontariff barriers are likely higher than those of price-based restrictions.","Are tariffs bad for growth?

This paper seeks to understand this phenomenon better by looking at the time paths of popular narratives over this interval, of stories that people have been telling that offer clues into their economic behavior. Six constellations of narratives are studied, identified by keywords “Great Depression,” “secular stagnation,” “sustainability,” “housing bubble,” “strong economy,” and “save more.”","According to the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee,==== the current U.S. economic expansion began June 2009, at the bottom of the financial crisis, and passed the previous length record, 120 months, in June 2019. It is still, as of this writing, March 2020, not known how much further into record territory this expansion might continue.====This expansion provides a useful case study that may help us improve our understanding of the origins of economic fluctuations. It is an extreme event, for which ultimate causes are likely to be more easily spotted. It is a current event, for which we all have fresh memories of the kind of talk that goes on during an expansion, and so for which we can judge the human elements better.====This article builds on an argument about the origins of economic fluctuations that was developed in Akerlof and Shiller (2009) and in my American Economic Association presidential address, Shiller (2017) and that I presented in my 2019 book Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events====This article builds on an argument about the origins of economic fluctuations that was developed in ==== and in my American Economic Association presidential address, ==== and that I presented in my ====. The argument is that economic narratives, stories that offer interpretations of economic events, or morals, of hints of theories about the economy, go viral just as diseases do, because of changes in the environment and of simple mutations of the narratives that put the contagion rate above the recovery rate, as in the ==== SIR model of disease epidemics.==== The economy is continually beset by multiple narratives, some going viral, some peaking, some fading away, and some positive in their effects on the economy, some negative, whose summed effects alter economic behavior to produce economic fluctuations. Like diseases, many of these economic narratives are perennial, and fade into a low background level until some mutation or change in conditions causes them to mysteriously explode into a renewed epidemic.====Every normal human being is aware of thousands of narratives about the times we live in. But economists usually pay no formal attention to the history of such stories through time. Attention to these popular narratives has been stronger in other social sciences, psychology, anthropology, sociology, political science, and history. Presumably, most economists think that these narratives are of little relevance to economics. The big stickler is direction of causality, which is hard to prove. Clearly, the narratives respond to the economic situation. The big question is the other direction. Do narratives themselves also drive ====? I have argued that causality is bi-directional. Creative people experiment all the time with variations on narratives, and from time to time these will become epidemics and change the nature of the economy. Other social sciences have done controlled experiments to demonstrate the causal influence of narratives, so it is to be expected that economic narratives as well have a causal impact. Seemingly trivial mutations of narratives, as when a celebrity name becomes attached to it, or when an event gives the narrative a connection with current reality, the contagion rate can rise above the forgetting rate and a weak narrative may explode into mass public attention, altering economic behavior.====Today, with digitized databases of news media and other sources, we can actually study the time path of narratives.

Normally, especially given strengthened regulation and, one would not expect another systemic event for many decades. But the situation today is anything but normal. Record high global public and private debt combined with political paralysis and extraordinarily weak leadership outside central banks make today’s uncharacteristically fragile at this point in the debt supercycle.","With real interest rates hovering near multi-decade lows, and even below today's slow growth rates, has higher government debt become a proverbial free lunch for advanced economies? Although so-called “Modern Monetary Theory” (Kelton, 2019) is perhaps the strongest (albeit not crisply defined====) version of this view, weaker variants have become increasingly prominent.==== It is certainly true that low borrowing rates help justify greater government spending on high social return investment and education projects, though of course this is nothing new. There is also a reasonable degree of consensus that low rates make it both more important and less costly to undertake countercyclical fiscal policy.====However, two important points have often been overlooked, and they are importantly connected. First, the conventional focus on market-traded government debt ignores the fact that in the modern welfare state, most governments have off-balance sheet liabilities – particularly old-age pensions and medical care – that are an order of magnitude greater than on-balance sheet debt. This does not imply that governments are bankrupt in any sense, as the modern state also has vast taxing power. But it does mean that riskiness of the government balance sheet cannot be assessed from market interest rates alone, as the true risks – to taxes and to benefits – are not transparent.====Secondly, the low level of market interest rates on “safe debt” may simply be a result of that fact that lenders (plausibly but not necessarily correctly) regard market debt as senior to off-balance sheet liabilities such as pensions. Put differently, in today's welfare state, which has grown massively since World War II, the ratio of market debt to tax capacity has shrunk dramatically even if the ratio of market debt to GDP has been climbing steadily. Low interest rates may also reflect that the public has increased its perception of tail risk since the Great Recession, and this too can significantly drive down rates on government debt, as the private sector places great value on government debt as a hedge against what Barro (2009) terms “rare disasters,” where consumption and most asset prices drop precipitously. But if paying off high market debt in a rare disaster leads to say, pensions being squeezed, the costs to society may be significant. Moreover, in scenarios where the “junior creditors” (who after all are voters) strongly resist, there could also be a spike in market interest rates, imposing further costs. Indeed, as Hur, Kondo, and Perri (2019) note, in rare disasters, interest rates on government debt do not always fall, and sometimes rise. The next crisis may not look like the last one. And new-age rare disasters are not so difficult to imagine, from a cyberwar, to a growth-crippling pandemic, to an extreme climate crisis such as Australia has recently experienced.====The point that the standard measures of government debt have lost meaning over the past few decades, due to the rise of the modern welfare state, is well known. Lawrence Kotlikoff (2019), building on his generational accounting research from the 1990s with Auerbach and Gokhale, describes standard measures of government in debt as an accounting fiction.==== Setting aside legal niceties, there is virtual isomorphism between pay-as-you-go social security systems, where governments “borrow” from the young and promise they will be “repaid” with interest when they themselves retire, and plain-vanilla debt, which the young might buy during their working years, again to receive payments after they retire. Generational accounting arguably takes this isomorphism too far, but if modified to the “senior/junior” debt paradigm developed here, it becomes quite compelling.====The point is not that today’s old-age programs are “bankrupt,” though it true that virtually every country still needs to make significant tax and spending adjustments to bring them into line over the next decade (IMF, 2019). Nevertheless, just because pension promises (or promises to provide old-age health insurance) do not carry the same legal force as ordinary debt, does not mean they can be ignored in the government's budget constraint. Nor importantly, can they be ignored in assessing the risk and costs of higher market-based debt.====Massive government provided pension obligations are very much a modern phenomenon. As Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) emphasize, in the period immediately after World War II, when conventional measures of public debt were high, government obligations for pensions and other social programs – “junior” debts – were extremely low. Moreover, other possible contingent claims on federal balance sheet – including the actuarial risk of bailouts of private, state and municipal debt – were also very low, having been ravaged via default in the Great Depression and World War II. On the other hand, as highlighted by Reinhart, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2012), we now have a quadruple debt overhang of public, private, pension and external debt, and these need to be analyzed integratively, including the risks. Spain and Ireland may have had relatively low public debt prior to 2008 financial crisis, but the government had massive contingent debt through explicit and implicit bank guarantees. Policymakers in Europe, especially, are keenly attuned to this issue, not only with the financial system but with pensions.==== United States policymakers, by and large, are not.====Kotlikoff (2019) estimates that unfunded liability of the US Social Security system alone is almost twice the size of the Federal debt, and that the entire fiscal gap of the US federal government is $239 trillion. While Auerbach, Gokhale and Kotlikoff's generational accounting methodology arguably overstates the parallels between what I am terming “senior” market debt and “junior” pension and social expenditure promises (the Auerbach-Kotlikoff methodology treats the two forms of obligations as equivalent), it certainly captures the notion that one needs to look at the effects of expanding debt on the entire balance sheet, not just on an accounting measure of debt.====Is there actually any risk to either taxpayers or to “junior” pension claimants (or taxpayers) when government debt sharply rises in a low interest rate environment? An important point underscored by Mauro and Zhou (2019), is that if one looks across advanced economies over the past two centuries, interest-growth differentials have been negative about the half the time, including in the run-up to situations where fiscal or financial crisis sent interest rates soaring instead of falling. Perhaps this time is different, but past experience suggests not necessarily assuming a negative ==== ====−==== ==== implies that much higher debt has no risks.","Falling real interest rates, rising debt: A free lunch?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300387,7 April 2020,2020,Research Article,222.0

However, if we look at a longer time horizon that narrative is not fully justified: since its creation, with the exception of the 2011–2014 period, Euro area's per-capita GDP has actually grown as fast as the US. The critical issue behind the different growth performance of the US and the euro area over the last 20 years is related to the Sovereign Debt Crisis and the inability of Euro area institutions to counter in a timely and effective manner economic recessions. Completing the EMU architecture and adopting an appropriate policy mix will be crucial to prevent contagion and bank-sovereign feedback loops from developing in the future and ensure that the euro area grows at its potential.","In Europe, but even more in the United States, many economists have been skeptical about the European Union's plan to create a monetary union. The severe impact of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and even more so the dramatic unfolding of the euro area Sovereign Debt Crisis (ESDC) seemed to confirm the darkest predictions of renowned US economists (Feldstein, 1997, Friedman, 1997).==== The economic, social and political ramifications of the crisis have consolidated a potent narrative of a European economy mired in stagnation. This is in sharp contrast with the experience of second half of last century growth, when growth was definitively stronger in (then catching-up Western) Europe than in the US. However, does Europe really grow more slowly than the United States? And if so, since when? Moreover, what do we mean when we refer to Europe: all European countries, the European Union, or the euro area?====For practical purposes, and also because the most passionate criticisms tend to be addressed to the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), we focus here at the growth performance of the euro area (EA) since its inception in 1999 and compare it to that of the United States. Had we chosen the European Union, growth would have been a bit stronger, driven by the catch-up process of central and eastern European countries that have not yet adopted the euro. As the EA and the US have different population dynamics, which in turn affect headline GDP growth, this article will mainly focus on per-capita GDP growth – which ultimately is what really matters when assessing well-being.====Interestingly, US per-capita growth rates have not always been stronger than in the EA, but just for 12 of the last 21 years. If we divide these 21 years in periods on the basis of major economic developments in the global and transatlantic economy, it appears that in its first nine years per capita GDP growth in the EA was in line with the US. The GFC years (2008–2010) took a heavy toll on both the US and the EA: averaged over the three years, per capita growth contracted by almost 1%. However, what really drives the difference in the growth performance is the ESDC (which starts in the second half of 2010 end ends in 2014). In the following three years (2015–2017), the EA, also due to its cyclical recovery, has grown faster than the US. The reversal of trends in 2018 and 2019 is mostly due to US economic and trade policies. On the one hand, the tax reform/tax cuts of 2018 and the expansionary federal budgets for 2018 and 2019 boosted US growth while, on the other hand, US trade policies negatively affected global trade. As the EA has a comparatively larger manufacturing base and its growth is more dependent on the external sector, the negative spillovers have been larger.====European policymakers should not be complacent about the EA's growth performance being overall only slightly below that of the US. As pointed out already in the Sapir et al. (2003) “there is room for the EU to grow faster than the US through the assimilation of existing technology and organisational practices and that there should be no trade-off between employment and productivity. Instead, after a phase of very rapid catching-up with the US in the early post-war period, convergence in the levels of per capita GDP at current prices and purchasing power parities came to an end at the beginning of the 1980s and has remained unchanged since at around 70% of US level” (p. 32). The fact that almost two decades after the report was written the EA has not been able to converge further and has even lost some ground should lead European authorities to renew their efforts to boost productivity and raise the growth potential of the EA.====In the article, we argue that, while the catch-up – or the absence of it – remains essentially related to technological and production organisation factors, as well as to social preferences, the slightly lower per-capita growth the EA has experienced in the last 20 years is mainly related to governance and policy shortcomings concentrated in a well-defined period of time. If the EA were able to complete the EMU along the lines defined by the Five Presidents Report of 2015 (Juncker, Tusk, Dijesselbloem, Draghi, and Schultz, 2015), as well as to adopt a more appropriate policy mix, many of the hurdles that have impeded a more effective macroeconomic management of the euro area would dissipate or would at least be significantly reduced.====Given its larger integration in global trade and value chains, the EA would not be able to insulate its economy form the repercussions of the US drifting towards managed bilateral trade. Yet the EU could at least mitigate these negative effects by remaining committed to a multilateral trade system and continuing to develop new generation trade and investment agreements with other like-minded countries and regions, also underpinning a wider international reliance on its currency.====Looking forward, it is not inevitable that EA per-capita GDP will continue to grow at a slower pace than the US. In fact, as GDP per-capita and productivity are lower than the US there is still significant room for further catch-up. Moreover, the EA has some elements of strength (lower inequalities, strong competition laws, a competitive edge in rapidly expanding green productions) that, if properly leveraged, can provide a boost to its growth potential.",US and euro area growth performances: Are they so different?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300442,7 April 2020,2020,Research Article,223.0

Empirical results suggest crude oil prices as measured by Brent benchmark have significant effects on stock market returns in Turkey. While we fail to document significant spillover effects stemming from oil prices in the entire sample, there are significant spillover effects from crude oil price changes to stock market returns in 1993 and 2008–09. These results suggest that government policies must take into account risk spillover effects between markets and that investors are better off monitoring crude oil markets in portfolio allocation decisions.","Energy is one of the most basic requirements of modern economic life in a country. In addition to being used as an input in many sectors such as industry and transport, it is also of vital importance with regards to providing stability to the economy and ensuring national security. Today, oil accounts for approximately 33% share in sources of energy in the world and occupies the first place. Not only oil has the largest share in primary energy consumption in the world as a raw material and basic energy source, but it is a unique/a non-renewable natural resource that bestows economic and political power to those countries possessing bountiful oil reserves.====In recent years, there has been a slower growth in global energy demand and the demand for energy has shifted strongly to the faster-growing emerging economies of Asia. The 1% growth in world primary energy demand in 2016 has remained below 1.8%, which is the average of the last 10 years. Nearly all of this growth has come from fast-growing developing countries and nearly half of all the growth in energy demand came from China and India. Recently while the growth in energy demand has slowed down, the share of oil in energy increased throughout the world. Oil gained global market share for the second year in a row, following 15 years of declines from 1999 to 2014 (nearly %33). Daily oil consumption in the world was 96.5 million barrels in 2016; 47.9% of this oil (46.2 million barrels) was consumed in OECD countries and 13.4% (12.9 million barrels) in European countries. The USA has the largest share of the world oil consumption with 20.3%. It is followed by China with 12.8% and India with 4.6%. According to the projections of the International Energy Agency, world energy demand will increase by 30% in 2040 while oil demand will decrease in OECD countries by 2040. Economic growth rates and energy consumption will be the primary driving force of this development. It is expected that the world economy will grow 3.7% annually in the upcoming period until 2020; the growth rate of OECD countries is expected to be 2.2% where non-OECD economies will grow by 5.3%. By 2040, the daily oil consumption in the world is expected to be 103.5 million barrels. Furthermore, the US Energy Information Administration projects the price of oil to be $116 in 2025 and $134 in 2035. According to the best case scenarios the crude oil price can be as low as $50 in 2035, while in the worst case scenario it can be $200 per barrel.====It is well known that crude oil, which has become the world’s most traded commodity since 2000, also has a major influence on the world economy and the economies of individual countries. Oil prices not only affect the economies of countries but also they affect financial markets and the prices of shares traded in these markets. The differential effects of oil prices depend on the characteristic of the country; whether it is an oil exporter or an importer. While increases in oil prices have a negative effect on oil importing countries and their financial markets, they may be a positive effect on oil exporters. Since oil is an important input in the production of goods and services, it affects production costs directly. Ultimately a rise in oil prices is likely to reduce margins, cash flows and thus stock prices except perhaps for the oil industry itself. Moreover oil prices can also affect stock valuations through the discount rate used for future cash flows. The effects of oil prices on the business cycle and on economic growth has been studied extensively in the literature. The main conclusion is that unexpected oil price shocks negatively affect economic growth in oil importing countries whereas it has a positive affect in oil exporting countries. For example, Hamilton (1983) found that all but one of the US recessions in the aftermath of World War II are related to unexpected oil price increases.====The relation between oil price and stock markets is important to policymakers and financial investors. Specifically risk spillover effects stemming from oil markets are important for investors as they try to hedge their portfolios because of portfolio diversification, and the effects on company bottom lines. For example Bouri (2015a, 2015b) pointed to the risk spillovers effects in terms of the design of optimal asset allocations. Bastianin, Conti, and Manera (2016) emphasized the importance of the relation between crude oil prices and financial volatility as it influences risk management and the desing of optimal macroeconomic and energy policy. Crude oil prices not only affect stock markets directly via their effects on companies’ bottom line as they generally affect costs but also have an indirect effect as they have an important bearing on the business cycle and hence stock market volatility. This raises a question as to whether the crude oil price is exogeneous with respect to stock market changes. For example, Bastianin et al. (2016) suggested that early studies may have failed to properly model the relation between oil prices and stock markets because the oil price was considered exogeneous in these studies. On the other hand, more recent studies recognize that oil prices are determined by both demand and supply factors and it is more appropriate to consider them endogenous (Bastianin et al., 2016; Killian & Park, 2009; Wang, Wu, & Yang, 2013).====There is a vast literature documenting a significant relationship between oil prices changes and stock returns. For example, Huang and Masulis (1996) finds a significant relationship between returns of future contracts and shares belonging to oil companies. However, there is no significant relationship with the returns of general share index. Jones and Kaul (1996) find that international stock markets react negatively to oil shocks. Sadorsky (1999) showed that oil prices and changes in oil prices play an important role in explaining stock returns and oil shocks have asymmetric effects on the economy. Faff and Brailsford (1999) examined the relationship between oil prices for Australia and stock returns of firms in different sectors, and found a significant and positive relationship between oil prices, stock returns of firms in the oil and gas sectors. They also found a negative and significant relationship between stock returns in paper, packaging, transportation sectors and oil prices. Ciner (2001) found a nonlinear causal relationship between the S&P500 index returns and oil future contracts. Fong and See (2002) and Nomikos and Pouliasis (2011) investigated price changes in oil future contracts using the MS-GARCH model.====Cunado and Perez de Gracia (2003) obtained different results for European countries depending on whether the world or the national oil price index is used. The authors find a long-term relationship between oil prices and economic activity only for England and Ireland. El-Sharif, Brown, Burton, Nixon, and Russel (2005) find crude oil prices, capital markets and changes in exchange rates have significant effects on stock returns in England. Huang, Hwang, and Peng (2005) examine the impacts of oil price changes and oil price volatility on economic activities (changes in industrial production and real stock returns) for the USA, Canada and Japan. They find non linear threshold effects; a change in oil price or its volatility has an impact on macroeconomic variables and their volatility particularly if the change is above a certain threshold. Arouri and Fouquau (2009) showed that oil price shocks affect stock returns asymmetrically in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.====Asteriou and Bashmakova (2013) utilized an international multi-factor model to investigate the relationship between oil price risk and stock market returns for the emerging capital markets of the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs). Particularly they find the oil price beta to have a negative and statistically significant effect in determining stock returns. Asteriou, Dimitras, and Lendewig (2013) addressed the relationship between oil prices and stock market taking into account whether countries are oil importers or oil exporters. They concluded that oil prices affect the stock market more significantly in oil importing countries than exporting countries. Cunado and Perez de Gracia (2014) obtained similar results for 12 European countries which are net oil importers. Chang, McAleer, and Tansuchat (2010) examined the conditional correlation relationships among WTI, Brent prices and FTSE100, NYSE, Dow Jones, S&P500 utilizing a DCC-GARCH model. Choi and Hammoudeh (2010) also found a negative relationship between Brent, WTI and S&P500 by using the DCC-GARCH model. Lee and Chiou (2011) examined the relationship between WTI and S&P500 by using the MS-GARCH model and found oil prices to have a negative impact on the S&P500 index. Lu, Qiao, Wang, Lai, and Li (2016) investigated time-varying causality between crude oil prices in WTI and S&P500 index using the MS-GARCH model. They found negative and positive effects stemming from the WTI to S&P500 in some subperiods. They also documented bidirectional causality between S&P500 and WTI. Bouri (2015a, 2015b) used a causality-in-variance approach to test the risk spillover effects between global oil prices and Jordanian stock market returns and found different effects in pre- and post Global Financial crisis of 2008. In the pre-crisis period there is no spillovers between global oil and the Jordanian stock market whereas there is evidence for one-way risk spillovers running from the oil market to the stock market after the crisis.====Turkey heavily depends on imported oil, hence fluctuations in crude oil prices have had severe effects on the economy. While consumption of natural gas and coal decreased in Turkey, oil and renewable energy consumption showed an increase recently. Although Turkey uses nearly 0.9% of the world's oil production (886,000 barrels), it is one of the most traded commodities in Turkey. One can surmise that the Turkish economy has sustained significant economic growth over the last decade and hence it can be expected that the demand for energy will increase.====In general, the relationship between oil prices and the stock market is examined in terms of the first moments of the variables in the literature. However causality in variance is as important as the mean particularly for financial markets because of volatility spillover effects due to the speed of information flow among markets. In this paper we investigate the causality relationship between international global oil prices and Borsa Istanbul via causality-in-variance tests due to Hong (2001). Given the empirical literature, one can expect an inverse relationship between oil prices and economic activity in oil importing countries such as Turkey. However, there is a limited number of studies that focus on volatility spillover effects between crude oil price changes and stock market returns in Turkey. For example, Soytas and Oran (2011) examined the volatility spillover effects from oil prices to aggregate and electricity stock indexes in Turkey using a VAR model and a causality-in-variance test suggested by Cheung and Ng (1996). Similarly, Sadorsky (2014) investigated volatility spillovers among stock prices and commodity prices (such as copper, oil and wheat) for 21 emerging markets including Turkey via a multivariate GARCH model.====The primary objective of this paper is to examine oil price changes and stock market returns in Turkey. In doing so, we improve on the existing literature in several ways. First, as emphasized by Gebka and Serwa (2007), first generation causality-in-variance tests by Cheung and Ng (1996) are not efficient because they weigh the cross-correlations equally. However, the cross-correlation between returns tends to decline to zero when the lag length increases. Second, the existing studies on the relationship between oil price changes and stock returns paid little attention to structural breaks in the variance of the series. There is a large body of literature that examine the effects of structural breaks on GARCH model parameters and the main conclusion is that structural breaks in variance lead to spurious integrated GARCH processes. This is important for testing causality-in-variance because Javed and Mantalos (2011) found out that causality-in-variance tests are very sensitive to the GARCH specification. Finally, we examine the time-varying causal links between stock market returns and crude oil price changes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to examine the time-varying risk spillover effects between global oil prices and the Turkish stock market. Given the turmoil in global oil markets and in the financial markets, a time varying approach is warranted. The issue is germane since the relationship has important implications for the design of appropriate asset allocation and regulatory policies to manage risk spillover effects.====To preview our results, using weekly data for 1990–2017, we find significant effects of Brent crude benchmark price changes on the mean stock market returns in Turkey. Even though we fail to document significant spillover effects stemming from oil prices in the entire sample, the time-varying tests reveal significant spillover effects from crude oil price changes to stock market returns in 1993 and 2008–09. These results suggest that government policy should avoid policies that amplify energy price fluctuations in order to limit the negative effects of risk spillovers from the energy sector to the rest of the economy. Investors are also better off monitoring crude oil markets in portfolio allocation decisions. The rest of paper is organized as follows: We give a brief information on the causality-in-variance test in Section 2. Data and empirical results are given in Section 3 while Section 4 contains a policy discussion that may also apply to similar countries that heavily depend on energy imports. The final section has some concluding remarks.","Oil prices, stock market returns and volatility spillovers: Evidence from Turkey",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300156,1 April 2020,2020,Research Article,224.0

It has raised controversies in different camps, either supporting or opposing it.==== Recent presidential debates, since the time of President Barrack Obama, have focused on the high-profile H-1B program among other specific policies. Also, European refuge crisis has spawned the conflict for assimilation of migrants with frictions. Current uproar about migration and assimilation of foreigners, frequently heard arguments resonate with the discussion on domestic impact on labor market, especially with respect to wage dispersion between skilled and unskilled workers in the aftermath of influx of immigrants. As both types of labor immigrate into the developed nations with the prospect of better income and socio-economic conditions, the heated debate about repercussions on rich host’s domestic economy is replete with controversies. As skilled immigrants contribute to the rich nations by dint of their talents and knowledge (for example, in high tech industry and Silicon Valley),==== while unskilled workers displace the native low-skilled one (e.g., high school dropouts or those with non-tertiary education), the debate essentially hinges on the issue of benefits and costs of curbing skilled vis-à-vis unskilled migrants. Gordon (2016) has offered a detailed study on the U.S economic growth and what is in store unless some appropriate measures are taken for nurturing innovation and ingenuity of workers.====President Trump’s policy of curbing immigration has attracted academic interests on role of immigrants—especially skilled talents—in contributing to the U.S. economic growth, and there are concerns for trade war and global imbalances (Salvatore & Campano, 2019; Salvatore, 2017; Stiglitz, 2018). The introduction of Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act in the US senate in February 2017 (revised in August 2017) aims to reduce over 10 years the legal immigration by 50%, via restrictions on green card, cap on refugees, and termination of visa diversity lottery.==== Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is another, which was ended in March 2018. Kerr (2019a) has mentioned that as immigrants contribute 25% of US patents and entrepreneurship, and more than 50% PhD students in STEM are foreign-born, national regulations constraining talent flows would have pronounced effects on sectors confronting new technological advancement and developing ideas. Inclusive Policy for assimilating global talents is important as it complements innovation policy as well (Kerr, 2019b; Stiglitz, 2018; Summers, 2018).====Not only in the U.S., Brexit phenomenon or elections agenda of France for the nationalist party, or for that matter the dissonance or antipathy towards the EU are also pointer to the fact that controlling ‘immigration’ is a major agenda to tackle malaise in the labor market. But, ironically EU Horizon 2020 or Talent Mobility Program under FP 7 (Seventh Framework Plan) are opening doors of ‘global pool of talents’ via research and brain pool initiative. So does South Korea in a non-English speaking environment to harness global talents to innovate and do cutting-edge research for enhancing the frontier of technology. Many economists have raised concern about such anti-immigration (or, anti-globalization) forces and their potentially grave impacts in future. Without assigning malice or being suspicious, can immigration turn into opportunity? This paper throws light in that direction where skilled migration-led innovation spillover benefits the unskilled under plausible conditions.====With global connectivity, migration is one dimension of networks for knowledge, which could affect productivity of innovation-user sectors (Gould & Panterov, 2017). Tension between skilled native versus skilled immigrant talents cannot be overlooked. Similarly, as technologies are not confined and rather percolate or diffuse across firms, the “labor-linking” nature of such aspects can no way be underestimated for welfare of skilled vis-à-vis unskilled (Basu, 2016). Unless innovation is conducive, backlash will follow with adverse consequences (Baily, 2014). It is pertinent to study the impacts of skilled immigration on innovation of such developed economies and how does it cause ‘tension’ in the destination economies’ labor market. Afonso and Holland (2018) discusses the roles of import tariffs on steel and taxes on multinationals for US labor market showing adverse impacts on wages of lower-skilled workers and job losses. There are differences in productivity between Skilled migrant and native skilled. Hence, wage differentials exist. However, restricting immigration could be counter-productive via contraction of innovative sector/s’ R&D output used as inputs into manufacturing sectors.====This paper adds value by exploring the role of skilled immigrants in innovation in countries like the US, and how does that affect the wage gap. In other words, we analyze under what conditions the adverse wage impact could be arrested so as to make immigration policy inclusive.==== As Kerr (2016) has mentioned: “These discussions naturally lead to a key objective that research should address over the next decade, namely, to trace out how high-skilled migration impacts inequality within and across countries. … Second, to understand the impact of high-skilled migration for inequality, we need to understand the real distribution of returns.” Supporting high-skilled immigration to a limited extent, Borjas (August 2017) has argued that: “Exceptional high-skill immigrants will introduce knowledge and abilities that we will learn from, making us more productive, and expanding the frontier of what is economically possible in our country. And high-skill immigration, unlike low-skill immigration, ====, rather than increase, income inequality.” But unskilled immigration is thought to be harmful.====In order to analyze this complex interplay of factors, a general equilibrium mixed-specific factor model in trade based on Jones (1965, 1971) is developed. In particular, the model has three sectors—skilled and unskilled sectors, and an R&D (innovative) sector, and primary inputs, viz., capital, two skilled labor types, and unskilled worker. R&D innovation—produced via specialized talent/skill and capital— is used in both the final goods sectors. Depending on skill and/or, R&D-intensity in the sectors, the direction of wage inequality will evolve. In effect, knowledge embodied in high-skilled talents ==== to other sectors. For an inclusive immigration policy via absorbing unskilled labor in the diaspora, we see that innovation should be having sectoral spillover effects and therefore, immigration could turn into opportunity. As will be furnished below, this has ramifications for distributional consequences.====Section 2 offers background studies motivating the theoretical model in Section 3. Section 4 derives some comparative static results. Section 5 offers stylized facts, and empirical testing of the core hypothesis, while section 6 concludes based on policy-guided hypothesis testing.","The Impact of Immigration on Skills, Innovation and Wages: Education Matters more than where People Come from",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300181,20 March 2020,2020,Research Article,225.0

The first pillar includes market-price instruments and direct payments, whereas the second pillar includes mostly agri-environmental, rural development and risk-management instruments. This policy has a long history and has been reformed several times in the last two decades. These reforms gradually reduce the initial market price support system and introduce payments intended to deal directly with potential market failures (public goods and bads, missing contingent markets, and unfair competition) and to directly support farm income. Consequently, the European agriculture is exposed to the highly volatile world prices, and the European farmers are facing higher market risks. This new context generates many debates on the optimal EU farm policy.====Many ex-ante assessments of the economic and physical impacts of these reforms (or proposals) have been performed at the farm and/or market levels. Assessments are performed with Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) frameworks (Boulanger & Philippidis, 2015; Boysen, Jensen, & Matthews, 2016; Espinosa et al., 2014; Urban, Jensen, & Brockmeier, 2016), Partial Equilibrium (PE) frameworks (Deppermann, Grethe, & Offermann, 2014; Espinosa, Gocht, Heckelei, & Paloma, 2016; Mittenzwei, Britz, & Wieck, 2014; Renwick et al., 2013), and combinations of CGE and PE frameworks (Pelikan, Britz, & Hertel, 2014; Schroeder, Gocht, & Britz, 2014). Generally, these studies conclude that the market impacts of the price instruments are, in absolute terms, more important than those induced by the direct payments of the first pillar, when the latter are linked to the land factor. On the other hand, there is less confidence in the relative impacts of the more recent second-pillar instruments.====All of the aforementioned studies recognize the challenges to model accurately the way CAP instruments really operate. These market CGE/PE models are well designed to capture the working of the price instruments. However, they rely on more disputed assumptions for the other CAP instruments. In particular, the important direct payments of the first pillar are often modeled through so-called coupling factors. These factors intend to measure the impacts of payments which occur through economic mechanisms that are not explicitly considered in these market models. Most cited is the wealth effect provided by direct payments to risk-averse farmers (Hennessy, 1998). In fact, these models are generally static and non-stochastic, preventing the explicit modeling of such economic mechanisms. This leads, for instance, Moro and Sckokai (2013) to call for the revision of these market models routinely run for policy analysis because the impact of direct payments is analyzed by means of arbitrary coupling factors. In the same vein, Carpentier, Gohin, Sckokai, and Thomas (2015) argue that these models are weak on the stochastic dimensions and that they need to be improved to remain policy-relevant.====To our knowledge, there have been limited efforts to improve the PE/CGE models devoted to analyze European agricultural policy issues within a stochastic context. While there are numerous studies assessing impacts under different market conditions (for instance, on the CAP, Nolte, Buysse, & van Huylenbroeck, 2012), they do not consider the sources of risks faced by economic agents, nor their attitude toward risks and the existence of risk contingent markets such as futures markets. These futures contracts allow economic agents to transfer part of their price risks and can influence their optimal risk management and production choices.====In this context, the main objective of this paper is to assess the market and welfare impacts of the CAP reforms in an original stochastic CGE model which includes the sources of risk, attitude toward risk and risk contingent markets, and explore policy solutions for the new European agricultural market conditions with increasing price risks. We integrate the stochastic dimensions starting from a standard static CGE framework and then modify the farm supply side. In the planting season, risk-averse European farmers make optimal decisions in this supply model based on price expectations and their volatility. We assume that the European price risks originate from exogenous production risks in non-European markets. When futures markets are available for European farmers, they also define their optimal levels of futures contracts based on their price expectations and prevailing futures price. In the harvest season, we introduce stochastic productivity shocks in the CGE model. The final equilibrium price jointly determined by the supply and demand side is not necessarily in accordance with the price expectations. The model dynamics pass on through the expectations the farmers (and speculators when futures markets are available) newly form from the succession of short-term market equilibria.====We show that the CAP reforms lead to larger market effects with our new framework compared to the usual static and risk-neutral framework. The welfare impacts are also dramatically modified, turning from positive to negative. This is mostly because the risk-averse European farmers now suffer from higher price volatility. We further find that direct payments have modest market impacts through their wealth effect. They mostly change the distribution of welfare across agents, not the global welfare. On the other hand, ensuring unbiased futures markets improves the global welfare by offering price protection to European farmers.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 explains our methodological developments. Starting from the standard static GTAP-AGR model, we successively introduce the farm household, the crop dynamics and sources of risks, the risk attitude of the farm household and finally the existence of futures markets. Section 3 performs the policy simulations with the different versions of the model to assess the market and welfare impacts of different policy instruments.

We first document ‘Vietnam advantage’ in a wide-range of supply and demand-related indicators such as school participation rate, educational ====, inputs and expenditure in cross-country regression models. We then estimate an augmented educational production function to show that these supply and demand-side advantages don’t explain away Vietnam’s positive deviance in PISA when compared to other participating developing and developed countries. We then conduct student-level analysis to examine Vietnam’s performance in PISA 2012 in a regional context, vis-à-vis three high-spending but low-performing ASEAN member countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) and two high performing Asian countries (South Korea and Singapore). Pooled regression estimates show that, holding differences in various indices of socioeconomic background, the gap in average student test scores between Vietnam and South Korea in Reading and Science becomes statistically insignificant. Moreover, once school-specific differences are also accounted for, Vietnamese students do just as well as Singaporean across all subjects – equalizing for existing socioeconomic differences between countries would give Vietnam an even better advantage in PISA. A similar gain in PISA scores is absent in the case of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The paper concludes by offering a cultural explanation for the significant variation in educational performance among high-spending East Asian countries.","Whether higher budgetary allocations matter for educational production is a hotly debated policy question in the economics and education literature (Hanushek and Wößmann, 2010; Hanushek & Woessmann, 2017; Wößmann, 2005). Many attribute East Asia's economic miracle to heavy public investment in education (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2016, McMahon, 1998, Perkins, 2013, World Bank, 1993). The region has not only succeeded in achieving near universal secondary education in a short span of time, East Asian countries such as South Korea and Singapore also dominate international assessments of student performance in reading, mathematics and science. This has motivated other high income countries such as the UK to borrow policy lessons from high-performing education systems (HPES) of East Asia and experiment with Singapore-inspired curriculum design and teaching methods in primary and secondary schools (Jerrim & Vignoles, 2015).====Within the East Asia region, however, high spending did not have the same impact on learning outcomes in all countries. Vietnam, for instance, excelled in international assessments despite the lowest per capita income among all participating countries (US$ 4098 in 2010 PPP dollars), a high level of corruption and a multitude of same kinds of problems that have been blamed for a low level of student learning in other developing countries (Bodewig & Badiani-Magnusson, 2014). In the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 round, it ranked 19th in reading, 17th in mathematics and 8th in science among 65 participating nations. There is no substantial difference in PISA performance within country, across regions and social groups, suggesting that Vietnam ensures equity and opportunity to learn for all children (Thien, Razak, Keeves, & Darmawan, 2016). On the other hand, its ASEAN neighbors such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand could not replicate Vietnam's success despite a more supportive expenditure policy and larger education budget. Public spending on education as a percentage of GDP during last three decades in these countries were similar to that of South Korea (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2014). Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand also have a longer history of participation in PISA and suffer from significant socioeconomic inequality in PISA performance (Thien et al., 2016).====In the above context, Vietnam is an important case study for middle income countries which aspire to build an inclusive and high quality education system. We examine Vietnam's education performance asking how and in what dimensions it is exceptional. The empirical analysis involves a global assessment based on cross-county regression analysis of indicators of school enrolment, educational inequality, inputs and expenditure. We test whether Vietnam's surprising performance in PISA could be explained away by country-level differences in supply (e.g. educational inputs and expenditure) and demand (enrolment rate) indicators. This exercise is complemented by a detailed student-level analysis of Vietnam's performance in a regional context. Data from two high performers (Singapore and South Korea) and three low performers (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) in the 2012 round of PISA are combined to study Vietnam's advantage. We ask to what extent differences in individual, family background, school and teacher and especially institutional characteristics contribute to explaining observable test score gaps between three low performers and the three high performers group. We answer this question by estimating a student-level educational production function, pooling data on six countries where family and school-specific covariates are added sequentially. This step-wise pooled regression framework helps understand which student, family, school, teacher or institutional structure characteristics in the PISA 2012 data can explain the Vietnam's advantage in a regional context. In doing so, we complement the existing debate on educational excellence of East Asian countries as well as Vietnam's PISA surprise in a global and regional (i.e. ASEAN) context and contribute to the literature on education development in East Asia with a focus on cultural factors (Byun, Schofer, & Kim, 2012; Glewwe, Lee, Vu, & Dang, 2017; Iyer & Moore, 2017; Jerrim & Vignoles, 2015; Jerrim, 2015; Rolleston & Krutikova, 2014; Thien et al., 2016; Tijana & Anna, 2015). Moving up the value chain of production and exporting more technologically advanced products through investment in education is key to escaping the so-called “middle income trap” (Agénor & Canuto, 2015). Therefore, our findings would be equally insightful for understanding the ‘PISA disadvantage’ of Vietnam's upper middle income neighbors – Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand – which aim to achieve high-income status in the coming decades.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

By performing a Panel Smooth Threshold Regression (PSTR) model developed by ====, estimation results show that the relationships between bank stability-credit risk and bank stability-liquidity risk are non-linear and characterized by the presence of two optimal thresholds which are equal to 13.16% for credit risk and 19.03% for liquidity risk. Contrary to their positive effects below these optimal thresholds, credit risk and liquidity risk become detrimental to bank stability in high regime.","Bank stability is difficult to define and even harder to measure. A banking system can be described as unstable in the presence of excessive volatility of assets or crises. Such a definition of banking stability is simple to formulate, but does not capture the positive contribution to understand the stability of the banking and financial system. Bank stability is a characteristic of financial stability. In general, a bank is considered stable if it meets two basic requirements: improving economic performance and eliminating imbalances caused by endogenous factors of unforeseen or unwanted events from different banking risks.====In most countries, especially developing ones, banks play a vital role in financing their economies and promoting their economic growth. Hence, the need to ensure their stability. This is why, in recent years, several studies have examined the factors that ensure the stability of banks or those who destabilize them. In particular, credit risk and liquidity risk are retained by the majority of authors who considered them as major risks.====The debate on the relationship between these risks and bank stability is not conclusive since the empirical results found are divergent. These findings can be divided into three types. The first one supports the negative impact of these two risks on the stability of banks. The second type, on the other hand, shows the positive effect of both risks on the stability of banks. The third current of literature proves the insignificant impact of liquidity and credit risks on bank stability.====On the one hand, these studies have the merit of adopting different empirical approaches, but on the other hand, they assume a linear relationship between risks and banking stability. This linearity hypothesis can lead to erroneous results that can mislead decision-makers and bank managers, since the sign of risks on bank stability does not change; negative or positive.====This paper tries to fill this gap and contributes to the existing literature by studying the non-linear relationship between risks and bank stability by using new econometric approach based on the Panel Smooth Threshold Regression (PSTR) model developed by Gonzalez, Terasvirta, and Van Dijk (2005).====Unlike other works, our paper seeks to show that the relationships between credit and liquidity risks and bank stability are non-linear and characterized by the presence of threshold effects. Our paper has the advantage to show that the impact of banking risks on stability is not the same below and above the thresholds. As far as we know, there are no published empirical studies which apply the PSTR model to investigate the non-linear relationship between risks and bank stability for an important number of banks. This paper is intended to be a contribution that can help the bank's supervisors to monitor and evaluate the stability of the banking system and its determinants.

Unfortunately, MSWM is often considered the responsibility of the Government alone. On the other hand, there is near unanimity world over among all key stakeholders on the need for citizens to involve themselves well in this process since they are the primary generators of municipal solid waste. However, lack of awareness among citizens and communication between Government and citizens is a major impediment in realizing this. Therefore, there is a need for some policy initiatives that would bridge this communication gap. Accordingly, this paper develops a framework for formulating a Waste Management Communication Policy (WMCP) that identifies the key concerns of the citizens and the appropriate channels to create awareness among them. In this paper, ","Waste Management (WM) is a critical issue affecting the entire world. Like other countries, India, too is suffering from the hazards of poor WM. The 2014 report of the Planning Commission of India claims that 62 million tons of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is produced every year (Narain & Sambyal, 2016). Unfortunately only 25% of the waste is processed effectively (Jadhav, 2018). The unprocessed waste is sent to landfills that become the breeding ground for ailments. Such improper disposal of municipal solid waste leads to serious problems. It has been observed that there is a higher prevalence of respiratory diseases and several health problems among MSW disposal workers (Ray, Roychoudhury, Mukherjee, Roy, & Lahiri, 2005). Further, the residential colonies near landfills suffer a lot. Indeed, a large body of literature shows a direct relationship between health problems and proximity to the landfills (Drumm, 2006; Gouveia & Prado, 2010; Maheshwari, Gupta, & Das, 2015; Rushton, 2003; Vrijheid, 2000).====Ideally, the first step towards effective Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) is a reduction in the generation of waste itself (Sushil, 1990). It can be done by adopting simple waste reduction techniques such as carrying one’s own bags or water bottles to markets. However, due to lack of awareness and sensitivity among people, such sustainable waste management remains a distant dream (Saeed, Hassan, & Mujeebu, 2009). While this is problem everywhere, it is worse in developing countries (Chakrabarti, 1998; Ferronato, Torretta, Ragazzi, & Rada, 2017; Jabeen, Nazia, & Akhunzada, 2017). This is because of their limited capacity to gather, process, recycle or dispose municipal solid waste in a cost-effective manner. However, per capita generation of solid waste in urban residential areas of developing countries is much less compared with the developed countries (Ahsan et al., 2014). Due to inadequate institutional structures, some developing countries have a long way to go before they can see an effective large scale system for waste management (Mmereki, Baldwin, & Li, 2016).====The literature reveals that the initial response to the issues of MSWM led to a lot of emphasis on the removal of waste rather than on efficient disposal of waste. It was only during seventies that the argument shifted to utilization from destruction. Even so, the waste processing operations such as recycling were done keeping in view the financial gains instead of environmental gains (Schwarz-Herion, Omran, & Rapp, 2008). After 90s, environmentalists too started giving attention to the problem of waste management (Gupta, Mohan, Prasad, & Kansal, 1998). Waste Management has now become an important political priority within the broad area of environment, and even beyond.====Clearly, the government can play an important role in policy formulation. In India, subjects such as environmental pollution are defined under Environmental Protection Act 1986, and the central government is empowered through this act to protect the environment. EPA is used to define the types and acceptable levels of pollution produced by establishments, along with penal provisions (Singh & Sushil, 2017). However, in the absence of effective guidelines and monitoring, overall MSWM has remained a challenge. For example, even though Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules (MSWR) were framed in 2016, their proper implementation is a problem in itself. Specifically, MSW Rules 2016, refer to segregation as one of the most critical steps towards effective WM. They recognize that segregation at source will make way for better waste processing, and seek to make the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) accountable to ensure compliance (Ministry of Environment and Forests Notification, 2016). However, it is well understood that this cannot be done only by the government and unless other stakeholders are involved, MSWM will remain unsatisfactory (Kumar & Nandini, 2013).====Thus, policies that involve all the stakeholders, especially citizens, are needed. Their participation is crucial in effective waste management (Joseph, 2006), since it is also known that public participation in decision making can enhance the partnership, ownership and responsibility in implementation. Biyani and Anantharaman (2017) discuss the strategies for a participating government and the roles of several stakeholders, including creating awareness among people for WM in Bengaluru. Better community participation has indeed aided some developed countries in managing their waste (Mmereki et al., 2016). In India as well, the cities with better public participation have performed well (Ganesan, 2017; Narain & Sambyal, 2016).====Good governance stresses substantially on transparency and accountability. None is attainable if citizens do not contribute in the governance process. While involving citizens in framing and implementing policies can improve waste management and prevent conflicts between different stake holders, citizens generally shy away from it since they feel their voice will not be heard (Antonini, Hogg, Mannettia, Barbieria, & Wagonerb, 2015). Clearly, there is a need to amplify community voices and connect them to upstream policy advocacy. Awareness building and regular effective communication is key to motivate and mobilize civil societies. It is evident from the literature (and also further reinforced by survey results, later in this paper) that there is a lack of awareness among citizens regarding waste management, and welfare and social policy modelling can be a potential approach for solving this problem (Estrada & Park, 2018).====A definition for “policy” available in the literature is “a theoretical or technical instrument that is formulated to solve specific problems affecting, directly or indirectly, societies across different periods of times and geographical spaces” (Estrada & Yap, 2013). Accordingly, the present situation calls for an effective Waste Management Communication Policy (WMCP) to solve the problem of lack of awareness among citizens. The purpose of this policy is to identify appropriate channels of communication between the government and various categories of citizens regarding waste management and thus create awareness among them. This includes ensuring that information disseminated to citizens is accurate, easy to access, relevant, and appropriate in both content and quantity.====Clearly, a good policy should address the problems of the target population it is going to cater. Since citizen engagement is crucial for effective SWM, it is necessary to understand their concerns both at individual and societal levels. It is equally necessary to educate the public regarding its role in waste management. This paper develops a framework to formulate WMCP and delivers inputs for a “targeted outreach campaign”.",Waste management communication policy for effective citizen awareness,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300247,2 March 2020,2020,Research Article,229.0

In this study, we evaluated the effects of economic (energy, water, ICT) and social (health, education) infrastructure expenses on income ","Public capital, and especially infrastructure is crucial for households’ and firms’ activities. According to the World Bank (1994), public capital represents the ‘wheels’ – if not the engine – of economic activity. Input-output tables illustrate, for example, that telecommunication, electricity, and water resources are used in the production process of nearly every sector, while transport is an input for every commodity. However, the World Bank (1994) also concludes that “infrastructure investment is not sufficient on its own to generate sustained increases in economic growth” (Romp & De Haan, 2007). Infrastructure represents those types of capital goods, institutions, and services which serve the activities of many industries in the marketplace (Kaynak & Jain, 2012). Not only is it the level of infrastructure that supports all kinds of production, and marketing for industries within the country, but also the growth and the quality of the infrastructure directly affect country’s economic growth. Infrastructure provides the necessary services which support economic growth by increasing the productivity of labors and capital thereby reducing the costs of production and raising profitability, production, income and employment (Nallathiga, 2015). This key essential service should be put in place to enable current development. Socio-economic development can be facilitated and accelerated by means of social and economic infrastructures. If these facilities and services are not put in place, development will be very difficult (Olusola, Emmanuel, Omoregie, Seidu, & Adeyemi, 2016).====It is highly probable that infrastructure investment as a national or regional policy leads to economy diversification towards new products, sectors, or areas (Rovolis & Spence, 2002; Rovolis, 1989). During the past two decades, vast amount of interest has been revived to examine the relationship between the public infrastructure capital and development on the national and the regional level. An extensive debate was sparked by Aschauer (1989) in his research on the US infrastructure in the late 1980s. Earlier researchers either approved (e.g. Munnell, 1990; Munnell & Cook, 1990b) or rejected (e.g. Holtz-Eakin, 1992).====Review of recent studies which have examined the relationship between public capital and economic growth suggest the following important results. First, regarding previous studies, the impact is much lower than found by Aschauer (1989), which is generally considered to be the initial point of this line of research. Second, many studies reported that there is heterogeneity: the effect of public investment differs across countries, regions, and sectors. After all, the effects of new investment expenditure will depend on the quantity and quality of the capital stock in place. In general, the larger the stock, and the better its quality, the lower will be the impact of additions to this stock. The network character of public capital, notably infrastructure, causes non-linearity. The effect of new capital will crucially depend on the extent to which investment expenditure aims at alleviating the bottlenecks in the current network. Other studies also suggest that the effect of public investment expenditure may also depend on the institutional and policy factors (e.g. Kemmerling & Stephan, 2002; Cadot, Röller, & Stephan, 1999; Cadot, Röller, & Stephan, 2006; Pereira & Roca-Sagales, 2001; Romp & De Haan, 2007).====The aim of this paper is to offer evidences from different regions of Iran about the complex relation between infrastructure capital and economic growth of the main sectors. In this study, energy, communication, water, education and healthcare infrastructures have been considered as important factors for private production. For that reason, we have included these endowments as the components of the productive and social infrastructures stock studied in this paper. The empirical exercise is carried out for the period 2007–2016 and seeks to provide a better understanding of the relationship between infrastructure and the production process. This relationship is crucial to a number of issues of current interest, but the difficulty of quantifying the effects of public capital has been argued by many authors (e.g. Berndt & Hansson, 1991; Wang, 2002).====In this paper, we sought to make three contributions to the literature. First, none of the previous studies have examined the impact of infrastructure on the segregation of different sectors, which can be done by investigating the impact of the infrastructure capitals on the economic growth of the regions. Analyzing the production function of different sectors can help in modifying the government’s policies, regarding to more fair distribution of incomes, and homogeneous growth of regions. Second, we used a different definition for infrastructure investments on productivity growth and economic sectors of Iran (industry, services, and agriculture), as well as a detailed analysis of the impact of infrastructure as a whole, in terms of both social (education, and health) and economic (water, energy, and ICT), and in terms of each type of infrastructure (education, health, water, energy, and ICT). Third, to solve the problem of heterogeneity of variance and autocorrelation of residuals, we used the panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) model.====In this work, we introduce a flexible production function which does not restrict the technical relations among the inputs, and therefore avoids the main problems of the Cobb-Douglas production function which frequently has been used in previous analysis.====One of the problems which previous studies primarily faced was the lack of comprehensive calculation of economic and social infrastructure stock. Undoubtedly, the comprehensive estimation of them is appropriate for performing time-series and cross-sectional analysis. To fill this gap, we have elaborated a series of this stock for the 30 provinces of Iran from 2007 to 2016 according to the methodology proposed by Derbyshire, Gardiner, and Waights (2013).====The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 provides the model and data Set. Section 4 reports the empirical results, and Section 5 discusses Policy viewpoints.

There is the need to target fiscal policy goals at the economic cost that obesity imposes on society instead of simulating arbitrary ==== schemes. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of imposing a revenue-neutral fat tax in Spain addressed to internalize the public health expenditure associated to obesity. Results suggest that this tax policy led to an improvement in the diet quality, and decreased the consumption of saturated fatty acid, sodium, and cholesterol. From the welfare perspective, the tax is regressive across all household segments.","After the UK, Spain has the highest prevalence rate of obesity in the EU. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among Spanish adults was 53.7% in 2012. About 44% of diabetes, 23% of ischemic heart disease and 7–41% of certain cancer burdens are due to overweight and obesity (WHO, 2019). Consequently, government spends a large amount of the national budget on public health care to maintain a higher quality of life among the populace (Thiele & Roosen, 2018). In Spain, obesity accounts for 7% (5 billion Euros) of the total government expenditure in the health sector (Vázquez & López, 2002).====The relationship between dietary fat content and obesity has received increasing attention among researchers and policy makers (Lin, Ploeg, Kasteridis, & Yen, 2014). Drewnowski (2007) blames the rising obesity rates on two main nutrients: dietary fats and added sugars. As a result, some countries in Europe have implemented nutrient taxes with the objective of reducing the prevalence of obesity. Taxes targeted at added sugars have been imposed in the following countries: Hungary, in 2011(Escobar, Veerman, Tollman, Bertram, & Hofman, 2013); Finland, in 2011 and France, in 2012 (Berardi, Sevestre, Tepaut, & Vigneron, 2016). Denmark was the first country to introduce a tax on saturated fat in October 2011 (Jensen, Smed, Aarup, & Nielsen, 2016; Smed, 2012) but abolished it in 2012.====Two strands of research therefore prevail: 1) studies targeted at estimating the effectiveness of arbitrary tax reforms to reduce obesity (Jensen & Smed, 2013; Sarlio-Lähteenkorva & Winkler, 2015). However, the impact is more regressive on low-income households as they tend to derive most of their calories from fat/sugar based foods. 2) Studies that quantify the direct and indirect cost of obesity to society (Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, & Wang, 2003; Thorpe, Florence, Howard, & Joski, 2004; Withrow & Alter, 2011). Even though these two strands of studies are targeted at obesity, no study has linked the two perspectives.====In this paper, we have deviated from studies that simulate arbitrary tax rates to reduce consumption of unhealthy foods or calculate the public cost of obesity. Rather, we have proposed a link between these two strands of studies by showing that a revenue neutral tax reform (based on fat composition of foods) can allow government to effectively internalize the 7%==== of total annual health expenditure (Krief, 2020; cf. Mora, Gil, & Sicras-Mainar, 2015; Vázquez & López, 2002) that obesity imposes on annual government budget. Specifically, our goal is to assess the effectiveness of internalizing the social cost of obesity on diet quality and welfare. The impact of the fiscal policy on food consumption may have important distributional and nutritional consequences; however, the effect is different across different policy scenarios and geographical context. A revenue-neutral tax i.e. taxing unhealthy foods whilst subsidizing healthy ones, can minimize the extent to which different socio-demographic groups are affected and the extent of variation in the daily caloric requirement. We aim at contributing to the existing literature in: (1) estimating the marginal damage cost of obesity from the direct and indirect cost of obesity in Spain; (2) simulating the effect of a revenue-neutral tax scenario that internalizes the estimated direct and indirect cost of obesity to the government; and (3) assessing the welfare and nutritional effects of the tax reform for household groups that are highly associated with obesity.====Contrary to studies that used the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model (Escario & Molina, 2004) or the Linear Expenditure System (LES) (Leung, Low, & Toh, 1999) to model tax reforms, this study relied on an Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand system (Lewbel & Pendakur, 2009) to simulate the global effects of the fiscal policy reform on nutritional quality and consumer welfare, as well as among some sociodemographic segments, based on homescan data from Catalonia. Body Mass Index (BMI) – kg/m==== of the household head and the presence of kids within the household were used as segmentation variables.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the next section provides a description of methods i.e. data and an empirical methodology.

Since the European Commission is highly concerned with both, territorial cohesion and the resilience of the economy to hybrid threats that could damage stability in the European Union, increasing our understanding on the drivers of the geographical variation in labor market resilience is of major importance from a regional policy perspective (European Commission (2016, 2018).====To investigate differentials in the economic performance across regions during the Great Recession one should investigate the factors behind regional economic resilience. Indeed, triggered by the context of the Great Recession, the concept of resilience has begun to be extended in economic analysis to try to understand the dynamics that occur in different spatial environments (countries, regions, cities, etc.) in relation to how they are affected by shocks and how they respond to them (Martin & Sunley, 2015; Martin, Sunley, Gardiner, & Tyler, 2016).====From an empirical perspective, this strand of literature has highlighted the relevance of different factors in shaping regional reactions to external shocks, including the sectoral composition of economic activity and its degree of diversity (Cuadrado-Roura & Maroto, 2016), the degree public sector shelter (Fratesi & Rodríguez-Pose, 2016), the endowment of human capital and the intensity of innovation activities (Bristow & Healy, 2018), national macroeconomic conditions (e.g. Crescenzi, Luca, & Milio, 2016) or urbanization patterns (Brakman, Garretsen, & van Marrewijk, 2015; Giannakis & Bruggeman, 2017). From an academic perspective, resilience has also attracted lot of attention and different scientific journals have devoted special issues on the topic.====Recently, two studies using different methodologies and research designs, have investigated the link between the quality of institutions and the economic performance during the Great Recession in Europe. Ezcurra and Rios (2019) employ spatial econometric methods in a sample of European regions whereas Sondermann (2018) combines time-series Vector Autorregressions and probit modeling in a sample of European countries. Both studies find a positive impact of the quality of institutions on resilience. Nevertheless, a problem in the existing literature focusing on regional resilience is that it has employed limited sets of variables to analyze this phenomenon and ignored uncertainty surrounding the true model or data generating process (DGP). From an econometric perspective, the omission of relevant explanatory variables that could affect regional resilience patterns is of major importance given that estimates may be inefficient and/or biased (Moral-Benito, 2015). Since it is often not clear a priori which set of variables should be included in the “true” regression model, a naive approach that ignores specification and data uncertainty may result in biased estimates, overconfident (too narrow) standard errors and misleading inference and predictions. A second issue with existing analysis on resilience based on traditional single-regression frameworks or shift share analysis is that they fail to derive a rank of the various factors in terms of their importance, thus, hampering the consensus on what policies could be implemented to promote and increase resilience.====To solve these problems, in this study we investigate if the link between quality of government (QoG) and regional resilience observed in previous studies is robust to model uncertainty by means of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) techniques, which also allows us to produce a probabilistic ranking of relative importance. Compared with the limited set of regressors analyzed in the existing empirical literature, this study rigorously assesses model uncertainty over a larger set of resilience determinants while minimizing omitted variable bias. The set of potential determinants considered at the regional level includes: (i) macroeconomic factors, (ii) institutional factors, (iii) knowledge and innovation intensity factors, (iv) socio-demographic factors and (v) labor market and sectoral specialization factors. In addition, the analysis controls for country fixed- effects given that country characteristics are deemed to be relevant to explain regional labor market differentials (Giannakis & Bruggeman, 2017; Rios, 2017). Through the computation of the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) for the different variables we generate a probabilistic ranking of the various determinants of resilience. Hence, the key differential feature of this study with respect to Ezcurra and Rios (2019) or Sondermann (2018) is methodological, given that unlike previous studies using a small fraction of the information available in the data set, we use the Monte Carlo Markov Chain Model Composition (====) methodology for linear regression models to explore the large model space formed by different combinations of regressors to draw conclusions. Finally, to complement the information of the BMA and provide further insights that might be useful for policy makers we perform a Posterior Jointness analysis following Doppelhofer and Weeks (2009). This analysis aims at increasing our understanding on the factors that might be complementary or substitutes to the effect of QoG on resilience.====This study is organized as follows. Section 2, which follows this introduction, describes the measurement of resilience and its geographical distribution across European regions. In Section 3, the BMA econometric modeling framework is presented. Section 4 describes the data set used in this study and the various factors considered in the analysis. The empirical findings and robustness checks are presented in Section 5, while Section 6 discusses the policy implications than can be derived from this research and offers the main conclusions of the study.",The link between quality of government and regional resilience in Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300235,28 February 2020,2020,Research Article,232.0

In this paper we show that even without any change in enforcement and deterrence, in an economy growing with capital accumulation like in Turkey, informality gradually and naturally declines. Furthermore, we propose alternative ","Informality in employment and production activities remains to be a prevalent issue especially in developing economies. Co-existence of strict labour market policies as well as costly and time-consuming bureaucratic processes along with insufficient or lacking enforcement of rules and regulations increases the attractiveness of informal activities. For a producer, informality implies non-compliance with government regulations and bureaucratic procedures with the possible consequence of official penalties when caught by the government if there is any serious enforcement (Loayza, 1996; Sookram & Watson, 2008; Ulyssea, 2010). From the point of view of a worker, the costs associated with being formal entails taxes that relate to formal labour contracts, such as income taxes and social security contributions, while being informal involves lack of social security benefits and job protection, as well as high turnover rates in the informal labour market (Ulyssea, 2010). From the government’s perspective, existence of informality brings about significant tax losses and limits the ability to efficiently apply tax policies as well as administer social security legislation (Fortin, Marceau, & Savard, 1997).====Reducing informal employment and promoting decent work has been one of the primary policy objectives of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In that respect, the 2002 International Labour Conference (ILC) Resolution and Conclusions on Decent Work and Informal Economy, and the more recent 2015 Recommendation concerning the transition from the informal to the formal economy (R204) adopted by the ILC constitute important steps towards facilitating the transition from the informal to formal economy by the member states. In 2006, Turkey, a member of the ILO and a developing country with still a considerable but recently declining informal employment share, has launched the Combat Against Informal Employment (KADIM) Project as part of the European Union accession and harmonization process. Later in 2008, the Turkish Ministry of Finance has announced the Action Plan for the Strategy of Combatting Informal Economy, and the 10th Five Year Development Plan (2014–2018) of the Turkish government included measures and targets towards reducing informal employment and wages. The primary means of attaining the objective of reducing informal employment in these policy documents have consistently been the efficient monitoring and stricter enforcement of rules and regulations, as well as deterrence through fines, rather than adjustments in the costs of being formal such as social security taxes (both by the employer and the employee) and income taxes to encourage formal employment.====Turkey, a developing economy with a tax burden on labour income persistently higher than the OECD average (OECD, 2018a, b), has an informal employment share of 34 percent as of 2017. Nevertheless, this share has declined from as high as 60 percent in the 1980s after reaching a plateau around 50 percent in the 1990s and early 2000s. The share of informal employment in non-agricultural employment, on the other hand, has shown an increasing trend in the late 1990s and early 2000s up to as high as 34 percent, eventually declining after 2006. This outcome attests to the circumstance that labour exiting the agricultural sector has been more heavily employed in the non-agricultural informal sector rather than in formal sector in the late 1990s to early 2000s, but after 2006, non-agricultural labour has become increasingly more formal. From a policy perspective, this development can in part be attributed to the implementation of plans and strategies mentioned above towards more active enforcement of rules and regulations particularly in the non-agricultural sector. However, despite these enforcement and deterrence initiatives, the informal employment share in total employment still remains upwards of 30 percent,==== as in most of the developing economies. Then, one can claim that in order to successfully reduce informal employment to targeted levels, appropriate policy design must include not only enforcement and deterrence measures, but also alternative measures such as adjustments in the cost of being formal, from the perspective of both the employer and the employee.====In this paper our objective is threefold. First, our aim is to provide an alternative explanation as to why the share of informal employment in non-agricultural employment has declined after 2006 in Turkey. We consider that in a growing economy where the rate of increase in minimum wage in real terms remains below the rate of change in labour productivity, even without any change in the degree of enforcement of labor market laws, the share of informal employment in non-agricultural employment declines gradually. Second, Fugazza and Jacques (2003) determine that rather than applying a deterrence policy, policies geared towards increasing the individuals’ benefits of joining the formal sector prove to be more effective in reducing the size of the informal sector. Also, Ihrig and Moe (2004) have demonstrated that even small changes in tax rates (leading to changes in labor costs) are more effective in changing informal employment than changes in weak enforcement. In that sense, from a policy standpoint, focusing merely on enforcement and deterrence proves to be insufficient in the combat against informal employment. In the same vein, our goal is to investigate the impact of labour market policy changes, such as changes in the minimum wage and payroll taxes, on the economy’s main variables, particularly on formal versus informal employment. Lastly, since the implementation of different tax policy changes create trade-offs, depending on the policymaker’s priorities, i.e. whether to prioritize a reduction in informal employment or favor an increase in consumer welfare, our aim is to determine which of the tax policy changes takes precedence.====To accomplish these objectives, in this paper we develop a dynamic model of a small open economy with an agricultural, a formal and an informal sector. Absence or lack of enforcement of government laws and regulations can be considered to be a prevalent attribute in developing economies. Correspondingly, one defining feature of our model economy is that in the formal sector, minimum wage laws as well as labour tax laws are perfectly enforced, while the informal sector and the agricultural sector completely evade these laws. The model’s initial equilibrium is fit to data from the Turkish economy for the year 2006, just when we observe the downturn in the share of informal employment in non-agricultural employment.====Results from the simulation of the baseline economy show that as the economy accumulates capital and grows with capital accumulation, the share of informal employment in total and in non-agricultural employment gradually declines. This outcome concurs with the declining informal employment share in total and in non-agricultural employment in Turkey after 2006. Labour market policy experiments at the steady state equilibrium of our economy show that a reduction in minimum wage as well as in social security tax rates lead to a decrease in the share of informal employment. The fundamental contribution of our study is to consider the relative impact of each tax policy change on the economy’s main aggregates. When we focus on the relative effectiveness of each tax policy change, understanding the policymaker’s objective of whether to reduce the informal employment share or to promote consumer welfare becomes essential.====A notable body of research has concentrated on the relationship between the tax burden, labour market policies, and the size of the informal sector. Loayza (1996) shows that an excessive tax burden and regulations with weak enforcement result in a large informal sector. In a model with firm heterogeneity in which formal and informal firms emerge endogenously, Fortin et al. (1997) assess that a rise in the tax rate on firm profits, in the payroll tax, and in the government determined wage rate all lead to an increase in the significance of the informal sector. Likewise, Albrecht, Navarro, and Vroman (2009) show that the labour market policies that are administered only in the formal sector also impact the size and composition of employment in the informal sector; in particular, an increase in payroll tax significantly increases the size of the informal sector and the number of workers accepting jobs in this sector. On the relationship between labour income taxation and the size of informal sector and employment, recent studies include Gonzáles-Fernández and Gonzáles-Velasco (2015); Lora and Fajardo-González (2016); Fernández and Villar (2017), and Kugler, Kugler, and Prada (2017).====In addition to the literature exploring the impact of taxation and tax enforcement policies on the informal sector and employment, there is also a separate strand of literature which deals with the impact of changing minimum wage laws, which indirectly affect informal activity. In that context, Fajnzylber (2001) argues that the impact of the changes in the minimum wage is not restricted only to those earning a minimum wage in the formal sector; he establishes that the increase in minimum wage leads to a decrease in informal employment as the increase in the minimum wage renders formal employment more attractive. Conversely, Suryahadi, Widyanti, Perwira, and Sumarto (2003) show that the increase in the minimum wage highly negatively impacts the vulnerable groups who lose jobs in the formal sector and have to relocate to the informal sector under low wage. Other related work on the relationship between changes in minimum wage and effects on informal wage and employment, such as Lemos (2009); Khamis (2013), and more recently Campos-Vázquez, Esquivel, and Santillán-Hernández (2017); Mora and Muro (2017); Ham (2018), and Jales (2018), also reach diverse results.====In what follows, we present the framework of the theoretical model, introducing the production sectors, the behavior of households, and the labour market structure. Section 3 presents the data and the quantitative analysis of the baseline economy. Section 4 conducts comparative statics analysis of the impact of various labour market policy changes at the steady state, including changes in the minimum wage, and changes in the social security tax rates imposed on employer and employee.

Using a panel VAR model, we show that changes in public sector wages have a greater effect on private sector wages than changes in public sector employment. We motivate our analysis using the Economic Adjustment Program for Greece, and a simple theoretical model. The empirical validity of these effects is verified through a series of robustness tests. These results have important implications on the evaluation of the recent EU Economic Adjustment Programs and the future design of Internal Devaluation strategies.","The countries that faced severe problems during the European Sovereign Debt Crisis, had to deal with an important policy challenge: consolidate the public sector balance and at the same time improve the conditions for the external sector. This problem has been more pronounced in the case of Greece, which faced an important twin deficit problem with a current account deficit of 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and a government deficit that culminated to 15.4% in 2009. Similarly, Portugal ran a current account deficit in 2008 that was approximately 12% of GDP as well as a government deficit of 11.2% of GDP in 2010.==== The usual policy prescription in such cases, also included in the EU and IMF initiated Economic Adjustment Programs for both countries, was to cut back the total public sector wage bill. As it is evident in the following figure, spending on public sector wages is one of the most important public spending categories, accounting from 15.5% of total government spending in Germany to 34% in Denmark (Fig. 1).====In order to cut back the public sector wage bill, there were two available options: first, one could cut the wages of public sector workers, while keeping constant the total number of public sector employees. Alternatively, layoffs in the public sector while keeping constant the wages of the public sector employees could produce the exact same results. Even though these two strategies, in terms of their effect on fiscal consolidation, may be strong substitutes, they have different repercussions for the economy, and especially on the process of external adjustment. For example, Ul Haque, Montiel, and Sheppard (1998) argue that cutting back wages adversely affects public sector efficiency, as it induces workers with a higher ability to work in the private sector. In the present paper, we examine the effect of the type of fiscal consolidation on private-sector wages. More specifically, we examine whether reductions in wages or employment have a greater effect on private sector wages. Given that besides fiscal consolidation, adjustment on the external sector through Internal Devaluation, i.e., reduction in prices of domestically produced goods through reductions in domestic cost, was a necessary component of the EU Economic Adjustment Programs, the effect of fiscal measures on private sector wages and on the competitiveness of the economy should be taken into account when examining their effectiveness.====The present paper is related to a large literature that examines the spillovers between private and public sector wages. For example, Lindquist and Vilhelmsson (2006), using data for Sweden, find a strong private sector wage leadership, i.e., private sector wages Granger cause public sector wages and no associated evidence that public sector wages Granger cause private sector wages. Similarly, Demekas and Kontolemis (2000) when examining the case of Greece find evidence of weak exogeneity of public sector wages for private-sector behavior. In contrast Lamo, Perez, and Schuknecht (2012), from an international perspective of 18 OECD countries, find feedback between public sector wages and private sector wages. This feedback is verified in other studies as well (see e.g., Alesina, Ardagna, Perotti, & Schiantarelli, 2002; Afonso & Gomes, 2008). At the same time, there is a large number of papers that examine the effect of public sector employment on public sector wages providing overall mixed effects. For example, Pappa (2009), Perotti (2007), Fernández-de-Córdoba, Pérez, and Torres (2012) find a positive correlation, whereas others find a negative one (e.g., Malley & Moutos, 1996).====In the present paper, we examine the joint effect of public wages and employment on private sector wages in a sample of European countries, using panel VAR techniques, as in Holtz-Eakin (1988) and Abrigo and Love (2015). The advantage of the panel VAR technique rests on the fact that it treats all variables as endogenous, allowing for both static and dynamic interdependence and accounting for time variations in the shocks. Moreover, the panel VAR model, as it is typical in all panel data models, allows for more observations in the estimated model, increasing the degrees of freedom and improving the efficiency of the estimates. Furthermore, it allows us to account for fixed individual/ country and time-specific factors and thus control for omitted variables problem that may exist in a simple time-series model. In order to verify that our results are robust, we perform a series of robustness tests. Overall our empirical results can be summarized as follows: (1) Public sector wages are found to Granger cause private sector wages. In contrast, public sector employment appears not to Granger cause private sector wages. (2) There is feedback from private sector wages to public sector wages as, according to the Granger causality tests, we reject the hypothesis that private-sector wages do not Granger cause public sector wages. (3) Public sector wages can explain up to 40.5% of the total variability of private-sector wages. In contrast, public employment appears only to explain only up to 3.5% of the private sector wage variability. (4) There is a positive correlation between shocks in public sector wages and employment and private sector wages. (5) The above results are robust to the employed estimation method, the time and country sample used, and also to the inclusion of additional exogenous variables.====In the next section, we provide a discussion of our motivating case, i.e., the Economic Adjustment Program for Greece. Specifically, we analyze the policy challenges that the country was facing at the beginning of the program, how changes in the public sector wages were supposed to work, and their expected effects on the adjustment process. Then, we try to put these effects in a simple model of wage interactions between public sector wages and employment and private sector wages. According to the policy analysis and the simple model, it is expected that there is a positive association between public sector wages and employment with private-sector wages. Moreover, according to our analysis, we should expect that changes in the public sector wages will have a higher impact on private sector wages compared to changes in public sector employment. These predictions are verified in the empirical analysis, which follows.====The theoretical and empirical results derived from the present paper provide interesting conclusions regarding policy design. In a country that faces a twin deficit problem, the process of economic adjustment can be more easily achieved through a reduction in public sector wages rather than public sector employment. Given the fact the usual policy prescription of the IMF in countries facing adjustment is to cut back public sector employment, our results indicate that this policy might be inefficient, at least in bringing down the unit labor cost in the private sector. An expenditure equivalent policy of cutting back public sector wages might, then, be more effective in helping the adjustment of the private sector. These policy conclusions can be rather important especially for the EMU countries that try to find the optimal economic adjustment policies.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In the next section, we present the analysis of the Greek Economic Adjustment Program, regarding the reduction in the government wage bill. Then, we provide a simple model of public wage spillover to the private sector. In Section 3, we describe our data and empirical methodology. Then, in Section 4, we present our results and the robustness tests. Finally, Section 5 concludes.","Under economic adjustment programs, do private sector wages respond to changes in public wages and employment?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300193,24 February 2020,2020,Research Article,234.0

To increase the global competitiveness of the region, the European Union launched the ==== to raise the level of entrepreneurship and innovation, which are purported to be key drivers of economic growth. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether this assertion is true. Thus, the paper investigates the Granger causal relationships among entrepreneurship development, innovation, and economic growth for a sample of the Eurozone countries for the period 2001–2016. Using a vector error-correction model, the study finds that in the long run, both entrepreneurship and innovation stimulate economic growth. In the short run, strong causal links exist but are not always uniform. The results reveal that Eurozone countries should indeed base their growth strategies on policies that promote innovation and policies that create incentives for entrepreneurship.","Vibrant entrepreneurial culture and a strong national innovation ecosystem are key catalysts for enhancing the socio-economic well-being of countries across the globe. There is an extensive literature that has examined the inter-relationships between entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth. While there is an understanding of the theoretical foundations on the relationships between these three variables, it is clear from the literature that the causal relationships among them are rather complex and are underpinned by forces that simultaneously impact all three.==== The literature on micro-foundations (entrepreneurial activities) of the macro-economy (innovation and economic growth) is still evolving, and the forces that define the underlying structure of the economy are still sources of debate and research among policy-makers, researchers, and industry analysts.====It is widely accepted in the literature that long-term economic growth is determined by technological progress powered by investments in human capital, research and innovative endeavours (Pegkasa, Staikourasb, & Tsamadiasca, 2019; Romer, 1990). There is also a large literature that shows that an entrepreneurial culture is critical for creating a vibrant economic environment that draws in capital, creative talent, networks and other resources to spur innovation and economic growth. Key seminal studies have discussed the link between entrepreneurship, a national innovation ecosystem, and the deepening impact of other traditional factors of production on economic growth (Huggins & Thomson, 2015; Schwab, 2018). These studies show that entrepreneurs contribute to the economy ==== several channels, including investing in resources to produce products and services that meet the needs of the markets; creating new employment; reinvigorating industrial clusters, creating innovation accelerators and special economic regions; nurturing and sustaining regional trade and cooperation; investing in research and development activities; introducing new innovations to the markets; undertaking social and philanthropic activities; increasing competition in the market that leads to better service quality and cost structures; and continuously undertaking product and process improvements.====Studies such as Dana (2006) and Dana, Etermad, and Wright (2008) show that strong entrepreneurial cultures have also spawned symbiotic relationships between small firms and larger firms, where small firms benefit from the knowledge spillover from larger and more technologically savvy firms. These studies also show that larger firms benefit from strong supplier networks consisting of smaller firms that provide cost-effective, timely and quality services. The dynamics between these economic agents form strong industrial clusters and economic regions that enhance national economic competitiveness. Increasingly, strong clusters are becoming important foundations for the formation of Global Value Chains that are contributing to firms’, regions’ and nations’ economic performance and competitiveness (Porter, 1998).====Due to the positive spillover benefits of entrepreneurial activities, governments across the globe have invested significant resources to nurture entrepreneurial activities and enhance the innovation ecosystems in their respective countries (Baumol, 2014). For example, the European Union introduced a 10-year plan called the ==== in 2010 to foster smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the Eurozone (World Economic Forum, 2014). Smart growth is defined as “developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation”; sustainable growth is defined as “promoting a more resource-efficient, greener and more competitive economy”; and inclusive growth is defined as “fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion” (European Commission, 2010; Samitas & Kenourgios, 2005). Under this plan, entrepreneurship and innovation are key drivers for ensuring sustainable economic development, job creation and improvement of the quality of life in Europe.====While there is extensive literature, both theoretical and empirical, to show that a relationship between entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth exists, there are very few studies that have assessed the endogenous relationship between these variables using robust econometric analysis (====, to assess the direction of causality between these variables in the short run and long run====). Hence, a primary objective of this paper is to shed additional light on the roles that innovation and entrepreneurship play in nurturing and sustaining a vibrant economy in the Eurozone countries. A secondary objective is to highlight the policy implications of the results.====This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, a brief overview of the theoretical models and key theoretical studies is provided. Section 2 also describes the empirical literature that demonstrates the relationship between the variables. Based on the theoretical and empirical studies in the literature, we formulate the hypotheses tested in this study. In Section 3, the methodology used to capture the endogenous relationships between entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth in both the short and long run is outlined. In Section 4, the empirical results are presented.

Voters’ attitudes toward taxation are important for representatives as they care about being re-elected. In fact, the salient issue in the 2012 US Presidential Election was income tax. Moreover, in the context of the recent financial crisis, public finances have been a hot topic in the parliaments of many European countries. In this scenario, benefit fraud and other unveiled cases of waste of public resources (see the case of the Panama papers and Falciani’s list for some examples) have helped sow doubt about the size of the welfare state and the effectiveness of taxation in redistributing income from the rich to the poor. Therefore, it is of a great interest to study attitudes towards taxation to identify effective policies to enhance public support for taxation and, consequently, welfare programs.====In this paper we revise the existing results concerning different determinants of people’s attitudes towards the size of the welfare state. Our analysis relies on multilevel methods, one of the most appropriate way of analyzing multi-stage samples, and the European Social Survey (ESS) (2008 wave).==== More precisely, first, we analyze how the perception about benefit fraud may shape individuals’ attitudes towards taxation. Our results suggest that policies that reduce the concern about benefit fraud help policy makers to increase both taxes and public spending. This result would imply that policies such as greater fines to those committing benefit fraud and more benefit fraud investigations are very useful tools to increase welfare public expenditures in democracy.====Secondly, we conduct an extensive comparative analysis in different European countries to determine the sources of heterogeneity in preferences over the size of the welfare state and seek to identify to what extent individual- and contextual-level variables account for systematic differences at the individual and aggregate levels. To this regard, we find that country-characteristics like the level of shadow economy are more important to determine preferences for taxation than individual characteristics. This result underlines the difficulty of a tax harmonization policy within the EU and suggests that policies to enhance the support of the welfare state should be analyzed country by country.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The novelty of the study is the assessment of environmental sustainability in a single framework encompassing globalization, financial development, and growth effects. Findings reveal that an increased level of globalization and financial development while improving economic performance are inimical to the sustainability of the environment. In the short-run, globalization, economic growth, and increased energy consumption are contributing directly to environmental degradation, while banking sector development is impacting environmental sustainability adversely through the economic growth channel. Given the severity of the findings amidst India’s tryst with economic growth, proactive policies are warranted to encourage adaptation of greener and cleaner technologies in environmentally sustainable areas. This necessitates improved institutional quality encompassing stringent environmental standards, legal systems, property rights, ====, financial information quality, etc., alongside the provision of incentives and subsidies to manufacturing firms undertaking technological innovations and complying with the environmental standards.","It is now widely established that human-induced climate change poses formidable challenges to our understanding of social and economic policy goals such as prosperity, growth, equity, and sustainable development (Mearns & Norton, 2010). India, considered to be one of the largest growth engines of the world, also has the dubious distinction of being one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change (INCCA, 2010; Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden, & Hanson, 2007). Being the world’s third-largest emitter (behind China and US), having tripled its carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion alone during 1990 and 2011, India is expected to account for 10% of global emissions by 2035 (IEA, 2013). According to the HEI (2018) report, air pollution resulted in 1.1 million premature deaths in 2015 (which amounts to 10.6% of total number of deaths) in India. The problem is even more compounded by the fact that about half of the Indian population is dependent on agriculture or other climate-sensitive sectors (GOI, 2018, p. 83). Increased recognition of India’s vulnerability to climate change is proving to be decisive for the policymakers to strike out a balance between climate change policy and economic growth and pursuing measures that achieve both.====The major problem in the simultaneous attainment of the dual objective is the existence of a tradeoff between environmental pollution and economic growth. Conventional analysis of the economic growth–environment pollution relationship revolves around the Environmental Kuznets Curve (henceforth EKC), which posits an inverted-U relationship between pollution and per capita income (Grossman & Krueger, 1991). It is hypothesized that at the formative stages of development, there are obstacles to adopting pollution abatement policies on account of high discount rates. With the growth of the economy, as the discount rate falls, it becomes possible to implement measures to curb pollution (Di Vita, 2008).====Empirical investigations on the presence of EKC are inconclusive with mixed results. While there are studies that lent support to the EKC hypothesis (Ahmad et al., 2017; Bella, Massidda, & Mattana, 2014; Kanjilal & Ghosh, 2013; Onafowora & Owoye, 2014), there are also studies that refuted the EKC hypothesis (Ang, 2008b; Farhani & Ozturk, 2015; Jafari, Othman, & Nor, 2012; Pal & Mitra, 2017). Moreover, studies reveal that the growth-environment relationship, to a large extent, depends on the nature of pollutants. It has been observed that for pollutants like sulfur dioxide, suspended particulate matters, nitrous oxides, etc., the results for EKC hold good (Bradford David, Fender Rebecca, Shore Stephen, & Wagner, 2005; Stern, 1998). However, for a pollutant like carbon dioxide, characterized by the presence of both national and international externalities, the relationship is ambiguous (Frankel, 2009).====It has been observed that human activity-induced carbon emissions act as the most important single source of potential global warming (Schmalensee, Stoker, & Judson, 1998). Moreover, in contrast to the advanced economies, most of the emerging economies are experiencing an accelerating rate of carbon emissions. It, therefore, becomes extremely important to concentrate on carbon dioxide emissions to trace out its possible policy implications on environmental sustainability, particularly for an emerging economy like India.====Like most transitional economies, economic growth in India has been driven by globalization and financial development. Globalization is a concept that represents a set of economic, political, and cultural processes that manifest in increased interdependence among nations (Goldberg & Pavcnik, 2007; Mills, 2009). Such integration invariably raises human demands, but in the process, harbors the potential of generating unsustainable environmental footprints (Hoekstra & Wiedmann, 2014). Such conflicting outcomes pose enormous challenges to devising adequate policies for environmental sustainability.====The literature on globalization-environment interlinkage stresses on three channels, namely, technique, composition, and scale (Frankel & Rose, 2005). While the first two effects predict a positive impact of globalization on the environment, the scale effect, on the contrary, predicts increased pollution owing to the expansion of the level of production. One major problem of the composition effect is its unrivaled focus on the preference pattern, which manifests in ignoring the production aspect of globalization. In this context, the ‘pollution haven hypothesis’ assumes prominence. It refers to the possibility of multinational firms engaged in highly polluting activities relocating to countries with low environmental standards.====Empirical studies analyzing the impact of globalization on environmental quality reveal inconclusive findings. Some studies found that globalization enhances environmental quality (Antweiler, Copeland, & Taylor, 2001; Shahbaz, Solarin, & Ozturk, 2016). Alongside, some studies report that globalization retards environmental quality, lending support to the pollution haven hypothesis (Cole, 2006; Fell & Maniloff, 2018; Silva & Zhu, 2009). Such counterfactuals merit further investigation to have a clearer picture of the impact of globalization on the environment.====Financial development, on the other hand, fundamentally refers to a process of reducing the costs of acquiring information, enforcing contracts, and making transactions (Levine, 2005). While a well-developed financial system attracts foreign direct investment (Ang, 2008a) and augments growth, there is ambiguity regarding the effects of financial development on environmental quality. While some studies document that financial development improves the quality of the environment by reducing carbon emissions (Jalil & Feridun, 2011; Tamazian, Chousa, & Vadlamannati, 2009), some studies also found that financial development degrades environmental quality (Abbasi & Riaz, 2016; Boutabba, 2014; Sadorsky, 2010; Zhang, 2011).====Given the complexity and the ambiguity involved in the impact of the twin forces of globalization and financial development on environmental quality, India has adopted a co-benefit approach (measures that promote development objectives while also yielding co-benefits for addressing climate change effectively) to climate policy. Recently, India has also submitted to the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with three qualifying goals. First, reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 33–35% by 2030 from 2005 level; second, achieving 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030; and third, creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5–3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 through additional forest and tree cover (GOI, 2015).====Considering the qualifying goals alongside the inevitability of globalization and financial development in India’s tryst with economic growth, the paper examines the effects of globalization, financial development, economic growth, and energy consumption on the sustainability of the environment in India. Such analysis appears instrumental in designing appropriate policy stance to sustain environmental standards in tune with the 2015 Paris agreement.====Our study makes at least two important contributions to the literature. First, we empirically examine the dynamic relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, globalization, financial development, economic growth, energy consumption, and urbanization in a single-country setting. Prior literature (Boutabba, 2014; Ghosh, 2010; Pal & Mitra, 2017), while examining the EKC hypothesis, have often overlooked the effect of globalization or financial development or both. Given the intertwined relationship between globalization, growth, and financial development and their ramifications on the environment, the omission of any single factor can lead to inconsistency in findings. Hence, a combined analysis would be better suited for policy prescriptions. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first single-country study to carry out such an analysis. This can help in formulating environmental policies that can strike a balance between growth and a sustainable environment.====Second, we contribute to the strand of literature on how financial development influences economic growth and energy consumption to impact carbon dioxide emissions. Existing empirical studies (Boutabba, 2014; Saud, Chen, Haseeb, & Sumayya, 2019) have used a single indicator to examine the impact of financial development on carbon dioxide emissions. Given the complexity of services provided by the financial system, capturing financial development with a single indicator could lead to potential bias and mislead the findings. We have decomposed financial development into banking sector and stock market development indicators. This helps in assessing the direct effects of the banking sector and stock market developments on the environment. Such an approach would also equip policymakers to identify the nature of the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and the financial sector and devise concomitant climate change policies for ushering sustainable growth.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Policies that might create non–tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade can be difficult to assess because, whereas a tariff might be represented in terms of its explicit price impacts, NTBs are often rules or policy statements that might or might not have actual impacts on imported volumes.====Scientific assessment of such policies is difficult. An NTB that requires the imported product to meet certain standards might have little or no cost implication and consequently no important effect on trade, or such requirements could give rise to such high costs that trade is discontinued completely. A description of the requirements or legal text of an NTB might give no guidance to researchers testing for market impacts. NTBs are not constrained as clearly as tariffs in many countries have been by bilateral and multilateral agreements, including in the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization (Baldwin, 2009). Despite such agreements, NTBs might persist or even expand, leading to increased costs for or outright bans on foreign–made goods based on arguments of food safety, labeling, environmental concerns, labor standards, or phytosanitary measures. To the extent that NTBs restrict trade without being subject to as stringent limitations as tariffs under existing agreements, methods for testing if an NTB has an impact and its magnitude are needed.====We focus on the Russian policy that claims to restrict chicken imports. In 2007, the Russian government implemented an electronic verification system. Meat and poultry products from the U.S. were among the main targets (USDA-GAIN, 2007). In 2008 and 2009, Russia introduced measures that prohibited poultry imports from several U.S. plants (Johnson & Becker, 2010). These limits to trade were extended in 2014 with the announcement that poultry imports would not be allowed from the U.S., Canada, Australia, EU, or Norway (USDA-FAS, 2014). The Russian government stated that these poultry import bans would extend at least until the end of 2017 (USDA-FAS, 2017). Historical data give circumstantial evidence about Russian chicken trade, including lower US-Russia chicken trade (USDA-FAS, 2014) and potentially different chicken price patterns (Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation; USDA-ERS, 2017). These data suggest that the ban might have helped to explain the decreasing role of imports in the Russian chicken market (Koopman & Laney, 2014). While these facts are suggestive, they fall short of reasonable standards for careful hypothesis testing to establish the effect of the NTB.====We analyze the Russian chicken import restriction and measure the NTB. Our approach follows these steps. First, cointegration tests are used to test the hypothesis that this policy really has affected Russian chicken trade. We model the relationship between Russian and the U.S. chicken prices, taking tariffs into account, before and after the imposition of this policy to test the hypothesis that the NTB reduced arbitrage and trade. Second, we build a second model to represent the Russian chicken market that includes explicit parameters to represent the tariff equivalent of the NTB. This model is used to estimate the impact of the NTB on this chicken market and imports.====We draw the following policy implications from our results. First, our findings support the hypothesis that this NTB affected trade; evidence supports the view that the Russian chicken import regulations have real implications. Second, removing the NTB causes a larger trade increase than removing the tariff. The estimated impacts on trade inform negotiators and policy makers who consider potential impacts of liberalization for domestic consumers and producers as well as for trade. Finally, our methods extend policy modeling methods by delivering both hypothesis testing about whether the NTB affects trade and generating corresponding estimates of the magnitude of impacts.","Non-tariff barrier on chicken imports into Russia: Impact on production, trade and prices",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300132,12 February 2020,2020,Research Article,238.0

The results are robust to the use of different de-trending methods.,"The adoption of a ==== in almost all member states of the European Union (EU) was aimed at affecting the budgetary policies with, at least, two objectives: strengthening fiscal discipline (Hauptmeier, Sanchez-Fuentes, & Schuknecht, 2011); alleviating tensions in the financial markets (Spilimbergo, Symansky, Blanchard, & Cottarelli, 2009) in a context where national fiscal policies coexist with a monetary policy moved at the supranational level.====From a theoretical viewpoint, the new rule allows some flexibility for the policy-makers as it defines the balanced budget in structural terms. This requires to split the overall actual balance (OB) in two components: the cyclical balance (CB), which isolates the action of the automatic stabilizers (Debrun & Kapoor, 2010) and whose variations are due to factors that are mainly outside the direct control of governments; and the cyclically-adjusted balance (CAB), which measures the impact of discretionary fiscal policies implemented by governments. Since the CAB has to be equal to zero in the medium term, the overall actual budget balance (OB) should only temporarily deviate from the cyclical balance (CB).====This new institutional setting has important consequences for the fiscal policy of the countries of the Euro area. By limiting the use of discretionary policies to a zero-budget balance, it implicitly confines the anticyclical function to the automatic response of the public budget. This means that discretionary policies implemented by governments might possibly fail to strengthen the anticyclical impact of automatic stabilizers or even go in the opposite direction. Thus, in both cases, they might compromise the anticyclical impulse, an information that is, in fact, crucial for policy-makers and that has extremely important consequences on their decisions on how to spend and tax (Blanchard, 1990; Claeys, Darvas, & Leandro, 2016; Larch & Turrini, 2010).====It is worth noting, however, that the way in which policy-makers implement discretionary fiscal policies is endogenous to the method in which the CAB is calculated. To this regard, the empirical methodology adopted by the European Commission (EC) has debatable characteristics, as it could lead a country to implement a restrictive budgetary policy while experiencing a recessionary phase of the economic cycle (Afonso & Claeys, 2008; D’Auria et al., 2010; Mourre, Isbasiou, Paternoster, & Salto, 2013; Mourre, Astarita, & Princen, 2014).====A crucial point of this vicious circle consists in the estimation of the non-observable potential GDP by using a production function where the potential contribution of labour depends on the unemployment rate consistent with the NAWRU (Non-Accelerating Wage Rate of Unemployment). The latter, however, is estimated through a methodology that can imply a strong variability over time and that makes the estimated unemployment excessively dependent on the current level of unemployment and on the wage rigidity in the short term (FitzGerald, 2014; Gordon, 1997; Holden & Nymoen, 2002; Schreiber & Wolters, 2007). Faced with these problems, the European Commission has recently revised the method for calculating the CAB (Havik et al., 2014); however, this adjustment applies only to some countries of the Eurozone, while it does not in others for which the detected critical issues remain.====Our paper tries to fill this gap by providing new estimates of the CAB that enrich the information set and the data available for the policy-maker in order to properly assess the impact of discretionary fiscal policies as well as to identify the sign of the automatic response of the public budget. In particular, this information is provided for 18 countries of the Euro area using quarterly budgetary data from 1999 to 2017. By considering country-specific responses combined with high frequency, the paper marks a significant improvement with respect to previous contributions aimed at analysing the cyclical properties of the fiscal aggregates in the Euro area as a whole (see, for example, Paredes, Pedregal, & Pérez, 2014). More importantly, it is in line with the good practice of relying on infra-annual budgetary data with the aim of fiscal forecasting (Onorante, Pedregal, Pérez, & Signorini, 2010) and simulating fiscal policies targets in the monetary union (Brück & Zwiener, 2006).====To this purpose, the focus of our paper is on the evolution of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB), i.e. excluding interest payments, over time.==== In detail, we provide new series using an alternative empirical methodology based on Burnside and Meshcheryakova (2005a; 2005b), which is not affected by the dependence among the actual unemployment rate, the NAWRU and the potential GDP. The CAPB is estimated for two non-overlapping sub-periods (1999–2007 and 2008–2017)==== in order to capture the different fiscal attitudes of the countries of the Euro area before and after the recent Great Recession started in 2008. Note that 2008 represents a structural break in our analysis, as it is thought to give rise to a period of ‘secular stagnation’ (Summers, 2014) experienced by many Euro area countries (Crafts, 2016). This might involve relevant changes in the conduct of national fiscal policies, and, to this respect, the estimation of the CAPB will provide important information about the degree in which discretionary policies may be affected by the institutional setting.====The most striking policy implication deriving from our estimates is that, even though the automatic stabilizers have widely acted in an anticyclical way in almost all countries of the Euro area, this impact has often been severely weakened by discretionary policies by governments, especially after the Great Recession. This outcome suggests that discretionary policies, rather than being the result of an intentional pro-cyclical behaviour of policy-makers, can be severely constrained by the institutional setting. Furthermore, the fact that this occurs in a great number of countries of the Euro area also suggests that the pro-cyclical impact of discretionary policies may be uncorrelated with the specific way in which national governments decide to tax and spend.====It is worth noting that this outcome differs from the results obtained by previous studies, according to which the impact of the automatic stabilizers in cushioning the cycle is often stronger than that of the discretionary changes (Egert, 2010; Fatás & Mihov, 2009; Lane, 2003). One possible reason of this difference is that those studies analyze the fiscal policy stance using annual data and confine the analysis to years immediately after the recent economic crisis, thus only partially capturing its impact. At the same time, our results are more in line with the recent empirical evidence, based on annual data, provided by the European Fiscal Board (2019) and Paredes et al. (2014), concluding for a high frequency of pro-cyclical behaviour of important fiscal aggregates in EU countries.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Failing to predict future variations in energy demand may lead to wrong decision of energy commodity inventory and strategic storage capacity dimensioning as well as international trade. Unmet demand may drive large price volatility on primary and secondary energy markets, which can further damage the commodities market efficiency and macroeconomic stability. Seasonality is an important characteristic of oil consumption and has implications for pricing, policy and investment decisions, in particular for oil which still accounted for more than one-third of world total primary energy supply (IEA, 2013; IEA, 2015). Technically speaking, seasonality in oil consumption reflects monthly or quarterly variation that is attributable to climate (e.g. hazardous weather), economic and agricultural activities, and other idiosyncratic factors such as holiday seasons effect.====The above statements summarise the motivation of this study. In the past, seasonal patterns in global oil consumption has received little attention because they were fairly consistent and predictable. But that pattern has changed dramatically and this story can be verified with a quick inspection of oil consumption data. In Fig. 1, quarterly means of global oil consumption are plotted for two sub-samples: 1984:01–2008-04 and 2009:01–2013:04 (see Section 3 for data definitions).====The purpose of this paper is, precisely, to analyse the smooth time-varying evolution of oil consumption seasonality, as opposed to analysing sub-periods. To extract seasonal patterns, this study will focus on identifying cyclical components of different time scales with discrete wavelet techniques. It is worth clarifying that this paper is not concerned with seasonality of oil supply (which is arguably negligible) or analysing refineries’ inventory or maintenance policies. The general research question that will be addressed here is how different regions or countries have contributed to the world’s oil consumption seasonal pattern, which exists, as demonstrated in Fig. 1 is time-varying in nature.====At the same time, the emergence of seasonal patterns is a complex phenomenon. Some regions of the world have ‘coincident’ seasonality (with respect to world’s seasonality) while other regions have seasonal patterns that tend to smooth global seasonality. At country or regional level, part of oil seasonality would be presumably linked to income seasonality (a vast amount of literature has found strong evidence of a relationship between income and energy consumption). However, it is not clear whether the relationship should be stable. Typically, when demand peaks all sort of physical supply constraints come into place, so the relationship between demand seasonality and income seasonality would be better explained when these constraints are factored in. The latter type of research is most practical at country level. Only very detailed demand analysis at country-level could reveal what drives the country seasonal pattern, assuming that data sets including enough detail on capacity and distribution constraints, trade, and sectoral consumption are available.====Dynamically, one can also put forward that fast-growing economies would tend to dominate slow-growing economies in determining global seasonality, and that such pattern would exacerbate or be smoothed depending on whether these economies have coincidental or counter-directional seasonality. Another important factor would be temperature-related, considering that oil is also subject to electricity consumption patterns. Warm countries tend to increase consumption of electricity in summer through usage of air-conditioning units, while cold countries tend to consume more electricity for heating purposes in winter seasons. Another layer of complexity can be added if we consider that when it is winter in the northern hemisphere it is summer in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa. It is therefore far from trivial to determine how regions or countries contribute to global seasonality.====Previous studies reported pervasive seasonality in the macroeconomic literature based on various econometric analysis techniques, see for example Engle, Granger, Hylleberg, and Lee (1993) for Japanese consumption function investigation, Kramer (1994) for financial market, Clements and Madlener (1999) for residential energy demand in the UK, Beenstock, Goldin, and Nabot (1999) found seasonal cointegration in electricity demand in Israel; and Franses and Kunst (2007) for industry output in EU. More recently, Kong, Dong, and Zhou (2015) investigated the seasonality in natural gas imports in East-Asian countries based on X-12-ARIMA model with monthly and quarterly data and found differences within countries.====Nevertheless, the observations in global and regional oil demand have not been deeply studied in the literature and thus offer room to new research questions to our best knowledge. For example, if oil consumption in emerging countries such as China==== continues to grow at a rapid rate, will this exacerbate the seasonality of world consumption? Are there countries which would smooth world seasonality as they grow? Which countries are responsible for seasonality in consumption and what will happen if expected oil consumption for the future materialise? Moreover, the academic literature on how the global oil consumption pattern is formed is still scant. This motivates us to fill this knowledge gap in the literature by contributing towards understanding how the global seasonal pattern of oil demand is formed.====This study is relevant to applied energy literature from several perspectives. Seasonality of oil consumption has implications for price variability. The latter, in turn, has implications for investment decisions, inventory policies and hedging occurring through oil futures markets. In addition, seasonality in oil demand has implications for trade of both oil itself and close substitutes, thus affecting energy security. It is also important for understanding OPEC’s oil output decisions. Oil demand seasonality attracted interests from both industry and academia as the emerging economies are playing increasingly larger role in global oil markets fluctuation, raising concerns also for oil producing countries, as an energy expert in Saudi Arabian ministry of oil pointed out “====” quoted in (Blas, 2013). Thus a better understanding of these patterns and their evolving nature can provide the reader with insights for deeper understanding of all the decisions mentioned above.====From a methodological perspective, a challenge of this study is to find a technique that allows for estimating meaningful measures of seasonality by satisfying three important criteria. First, the methodology should allow for the identification of a long-run non-linear and medium-run cyclical component. By definition, a seasonal pattern is measured relative to a mean. It is then crucial to define the mean in an appropriate way. Based on the aforementioned considerations, it is plausible to expect that both the long-run and medium-run should determine that mean. Technically speaking, the number of overlapping components decomposing the time-series should not be limited to two or three frequencies, and one should have enough freedom to decide how to treat the series that have no quarter cyclicality. Second, the seasonality and trend measures extracted from the data should be time-varying (as opposed to fixed parameters associated with dummy variables in a regression, for example), as it is of interest to analyse the evolution of these patterns. Third, the methodology should allow for inversion of patterns (e.g. quarter 1 seasonality may be below trend in certain country during some period, and then move to a pattern above trend afterwards).====Overall, we consider that a discrete multi-resolution wavelet transform approach satisfies the three criteria while providing enough flexibility for identifying all underlying trends. This non-parametric technique has become standard in many fields that require identification of overlapping cyclical components of different amplitude; the best example would be temperature time series but the technique has been applied in many economic studies as well. For instance, in the context of oil price and exchange rate analysis, Reboredo and Rivera-Castro (2013) argue that, in contrast to traditional time-series methodologies, the wavelet method is model-free and allows for estimation of components of multiple time scales (in fact, all possible frequency scales), not just a few. Naccache (2011) also favours the use of multi-resolution wavelets over parametric techniques for analysing the oil price-macroeconomic relationship.====Traditional time-series parametric econometric techniques, such as ARIMA, state-space models or X-12 techniques, suffer the disadvantage that important decisions have to be made in regards to the structure of the model and the number of overlapping cyclical components may be limited or lead to statistical inefficiency if the number of parameter estimates is high relative to the number of observations. Traditional time-series approaches are most useful for identifying a long-run smooth trend or few trends, and have the advantage that could be incorporated into multi-variate analysis. The approach in this paper focuses on univariate estimation of all cyclical components over the whole spectrum of amplitudes, although some frequencies will be conveniently grouped for analytical purposes. Our wavelet approach starts with the lowest possible frequency amplitude in the data set (quarterly) and increases it by a factor of two in every step (Nyquist’s rule) until the maximum frequency of the spectrum is reached. The analysis conducted in this paper is, to our best knowledge, the first to decompose global oil seasonality based on discrete multi-resolution wavelet transform approach in the literature.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Related literature is reviewed in Section 2. The data set is described in Section 3. Section 4 provides a simplified explanation of the algorithm used to analyse the data over multi-resolution spectra (full details are available in the Appendix). Section 5 presents the findings.

Archives constitute an exception notwithstanding their cultural and historical relevance. This paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to fill this lacuna. The analysis of the performance of archives raises theoretical issues because their outputs have characteristics of a pure public good (preservation) and of a private service (utilisation). Moreover, the trade-off between the long and short-run goals of, respectively, preservation and utilisation is central in most public policies concerning heritage. We address this issue by studying the efficiency of public historical archives (PHAs) in Italy, over the period 2011–2012. We use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and implement one-stage and two-stage approaches to investigate PHAs’ performance in the management of their different and potentially conflicting functions. Our analysis shows that PHAs perform better in the preservation function, considering the objectives and constraints they face.","Archives perform the function of storing and preserving data for future generations (e.g. the Arctic World Archive) and, in many cases, operate as cultural institutions that give access to valuable records and items they protect. Since “archives are preserved for use by present and future generations‿ (International Council on Archives, 2012; p. 6), they have two different and potentially contrasting missions, a long-run one – to preserve – and a short-run one – to supply services on demand for various purposes (research, education and entertainment) – which, however, may cause the deterioration of the preserved items.====Several projects have developed across the world (see the E-ARK project in the European Union) to exploit digital technologies and develop a common international standard able to improve the utilisation and valorisation of archival collections, without jeopardizing their preservation. However, insofar as the process of digitisation of records is still far from being completed, the fundamental trade-off between preservation and utilisation (or valorisation) still exists, and necessarily influences the policies implemented. This is the case, for instance, of the Italian public historic archives (==== — PHAs) whose extensive and fragile patrimony highlights the problem of combining the preservation of valuable items with their utilisation on demand and broader valorisation to the benefit of the public. The design of policies, especially those regarding the allocation of resources within the spectrum of activities and functions of cultural institutions, as well as the managerial organisation face this general trade-off between preservation and utilisation. Since these two functions serve, at least partially, different interests, a crucial policy issue is whether the actual performance of cultural institutions in pursuing these two functions is consistent with the set of relevant social preferences.====The economic investigation of the performance of provision of cultural services is longstanding. It has developed using different methodologies and approaches and concerned several fields: museums, theatres, libraries, and heritage authorities. Among the different aspects of the performance of organisations providing cultural services, efficiency is probably the mostly explored one with a focus on technical efficiency, namely the maximisation of the output of a production process for given quantities of inputs.====The measurement of the differential efficiency in performing the functions of preservation and utilisation is a crucial step in exploring the specific policy issue highlighted above. This is a quite complex technical problem for the technical interrelations existing between preservation and utilisation in the identification of the production function. In this paper we measure the technical efficiency of PHAs in Italy, employing an official detailed dataset provided by the Italian Ministry for Cultural Goods (==== — MiBAC) and by the State General Accounting Department (==== — RGS) of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance. We use different non-parametric approaches, including one- and two-stage models, to account for the peculiar features of PHAs and, above all, to offer a meaningful picture of Italian PHAs’ performance, in terms of efficiency of the two functions. This analysis is instrumental to discuss the policy issue of how managerial decisions impact on the trade-off in performance between preservation and utilisation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to analyse the technical efficiency of archives, filling a lacuna that contrasts with the relevant role played by these institutions in Italy and worldwide.====The specific function of PHAs is to preserve primary sources that are available only upon requests and cannot be borrowed. PHAs, therefore, provide services combining public (preservation) and private (utilisation) characteristics similarly to museums and public libraries, which have in common with the former the nature of memory institutions, though with some specificities. On the one hand, archival records are in most cases unique, unlike libraries, where publications are in general replaceable. This feature relates archives to museums. On the other hand, PHAs have services on demand that are rare in the latter. Moreover, archives are bound to accept and preserve records and documents of selected offices according to specific disposal procedures==== whereas museums can have a voice in accruing their collection.====The twofold objective of PHAs — supplying services on demand for various purposes (research, education, entertainment) and preserving valuable items and records for future generations — is, as discussed earlier, familiar to cultural management and may have a striking influence on the outcome of public policies. The different performance of PHAs with respect to their functions can assume a policy relevance inasmuch it may contrast with social preferences for the two functions, and it may be explained looking at some relevant features of the decision-making context characterising these institutions: the resource constraints and the incentives faced by the institutions’ managers; their institutional goals; their personal characteristics, such as preferences and educational background.====The quality of bureaucracy is relevant for reaching a specific output (Adams & Klobodu, 2017) and the management of PHAs is generally attributed to people with an archivist educational background. As it often happens with professionals with managerial roles in cultural institutions, their objectives may be strongly influenced by their reputation within the profession and by their primary adherence to specific professional standards. However, the specific educational background and experience of managers of PHAs may not provide them with the economics and management skills needed to deal with utilisation activities. According to this reasoning, we would expect that PHAs would perform better in preserving the stored items rather than facilitating various utilisations by the public. Within this view, the recent proliferation of public projects to improve digitisation of PHAs in Italy==== can be interpreted as an attempt by the national policymaker to overcome the natural managerial risk-aversion for utilisation and valorisation, improving fruition without risk for conservation.====Very little attention has been so far devoted to PHAs in the cultural economics literature, with the only exceptions being Borowiecki and Navarrete (2017) and Guccio, Martorana, Mazza, and Rizzo (2016), which consider the implications of digitisation. In addition to provide insights on the specificities of PHAs helpful to define interventions improving their performance, the present study contributes to the empirical literature on the efficiency of cultural institutions in several ways. Firstly, because of the peculiar nature of the preservation function of PHAs, we are able to overcome some of the shortcomings in the measurement of efficiency of cultural institutions, above all those due to the lack of homogeneity of outputs across organisations. Secondly, by using both physical and monetary measures of the size of the collection managed by PHAs, we move further in overcoming the homogeneity problems inherent in the aggregate measure of “number of pieces‿ customarily used in other studies. Finally, our empirical strategy will allow a consistent and separate estimation of efficiency of preservation and utilisation, which can provide information on how the managers of these institutions weigh these activities in their managerial choices, enabling us to study their operational relationship and derive policy implications.====As expected, among the most significant results of our empirical analysis, we show higher efficiency scores in the preservation function than in the utilisation one, with evidence of a trade-off between these two functions. Such results have relevant policy implications and stress the importance of programs aiming at overcoming the institutional and operational constraints faced by PHAs’ managers and at enhancing users’ participation.====The study is organised as follows. Section 2 offers a brief overview of the theoretical issues as well as the institutional features of PHAs in Italy. Section 3 describes the methodology and the data used.

After accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, our empirical analysis reveals that households headed by ill-health members and those with hospitalization are inevitably more vulnerable to indebtedness. The ill-health status of other working-age members also creates milder effects on household indebtedness. We confirm that the health-debt cycle is more severe for urban households, compared to their rural counterparts. The study is testimony to re-emphasizing the role of government in providing much-needed financial protection to vulnerable households and implementing differentiated-policy packages for urban and rural sectors in order to effectively break the health-debt cycle.","The resistant health-debt cycle experienced by households, particularly in developing countries has become a key consequence of health adversities (Dhanaraj, 2016; Krishna, Kapila, Porwal, & Singh, 2005; Krishna, 2006; Wagstaff & Lindelow, 2014). It has been a trending area in welfare policy studies (e.g., Clayton, Liñares-Zegarra, & Wilson, 2015; Richardson, Elliott, & Roberts, 2013; Sweet, Nandi, Adam, & McDade, 2013; Taylor, Stevens, Agho, & Raphael, 2017). There is a large variation in government health funding and thus in out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure levels across countries. Availability of health insurance and self-insurance (absence of liquidity constraints) in developed countries plays a vital role in ensuring normal consumption patterns and satisfactory healthcare utilization after a major illness (Babiarz, Widdows, & Yilmazer, 2013; Grigorakis, Floros, Tsangari, & Tsoukatos, 2016). Households in developing countries heavily rely on cash borrowing due to lack of precautionary savings, lower financial assets and unavailability of private health insurance (Babiarz et al., 2013; Mitra, Palmer, Mont, & Groce, 2016; Mohanan, 2013). In Indonesia, policy options need to be explored because households tend to borrow when faced with health-related risks (Sparrow et al., 2014). In Vietnam, Mitra et al. (2016) note that households facing health shocks demonstrate a significantly higher likelihood of getting loans. However, as the least developed country in the South Asian region, Bangladesh promotes microcredit schemes, as a government policy, to ensure a basic level of consumption in the event of health shocks and hospitalization (Islam & Maitra, 2012).====From the public policy standpoint, household borrowing associated with events of ill-health can be viewed from different perspectives. In the short run, access to borrowing is an advantage, because it provides consumption-smoothing and ensures satisfactory levels of healthcare utilization; in the long run, households become indebted, with adverse economic consequences and high financial risks. High levels of household indebtedness can make economies more vulnerable to disruptions and then to degeneration in growth (Sahoo & Dash, 2013; Zabai, 2017). This warrants strategic design and careful implementation of government policy options, including the implications for design of insurance and provider payments, that is, from both sides of the health-debt nexus (Nuscheler & Roeder, 2015).====Policy options available for correcting negative effects of health-debt cycles are predominantly country-specific, depending on the nature of households, health insurance status, and the development of the financial sector (Giles & Yoo, 2007; Suramya & Veena, 2006). Different household cohorts tend to adopt different coping strategies to tackle health adversities. Mitra et al. (2016) note that Vietnamese female-headed households have the largest uptake of loans in the event of hospitalization of a member of working-age compared to male-headed households; rural households are more likely to borrow in events of ill-health compared to their urban counterparts. In Indonesia, borrowing seems a key coping mechanism for poor households (Sparrow et al., 2014). Babiarz et al. (2013) report that across countries households with low financial assets and no health insurance are easily trapped with unsecured-debt due to ill-health.====When examining issues of policy modelling, reverse causality is inevitable in health-debt equations, because an excessive debt burden can also affect health in several ways, increasing the risk of physical and psychological conditions of members (Babiarz et al., 2013; Clayton et al., 2015). Although reverse causality issue in health-debt models is difficult to solve econometrically (Mitra et al., 2016), some studies argue strongly that ill-health causes debt-burden but the reverse is less likely (Lyons & Yilmazer, 2005; Michaud & van Soest, 2008; Babiarz et al., 2013; Mohanan, 2013). Second, examining the health-debt nexus generally faces the issue of unobserved heterogeneity, which affects both health and debt (Babiarz et al., 2013; Mitra et al., 2016; Strauss & Thomas, 2008) – there may be unobserved factors correlated with health affecting household financial situations. With unobserved heterogeneity, establishment of a causal link between health and debt will become even more complicated (Babiarz et al., 2013). Thus, an analysis accounting for reverse-causality and heterogeneity in effects may have a greater policy relevance because policy options can be directed and prioritized according to household level of vulnerability in order to resolve the health-debt cycle more effectively.====Some studies attempt to econometrically control unobserved heterogeneity using random parameter models that allow household specific intercepts (see Dassanayake, Luckert, & Mohapatra, 2015). However, in random parameter models, we assume a pre-specified distribution according to which parameter values are allowed to vary. Thus, a distributional form on variables needs to be imposed, and this may be restrictive (Hynes & Hanley, 2005). At the extreme end, each observation is with its own parameter when the parameter varies significantly across observations. Hence the estimation of random parameter models may be complicated. In modelling unobserved heterogeneity, finite mixture models have become attractive due to their flexibility (Melnykov & Maitra, 2010). In these we can approximate any arbitrary continuous distribution by using a combination of normal densities.====We use nation-wide micro data to examine the health-debt cycle and to explore potential policy options to alter it. We also quantify moderator-effects of living sector to examine how the health-debt cycle differs across rural and urban-based households. The study contributes to the ongoing debate on health-debt cycle in several ways. First, it addresses the prevalence of reverse-causality by measuring health adversities as lagged-variables. The Sri Lanka Household Income and Expenditure Survey-2016 (Sri Lanka HIES-2016) enables us to identify the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as lagged variables, depending on their time of diagnosis. Second, we correct results for unobserved heterogeneity using a finite-mixture framework and identify underlying classes of households in terms of their likelihood of indebtedness. This provides more specific and unbiased results, enabling evidence-based policy making process. Third, we improve policy relevance by quantifying moderator effects of the living sector; this leads to sector-specific policies on the health-debt cycle of households. This opens a window through which policy makers can view the consequences of health policy options on household welfare.",Breaking the Perverse Health-debt Cycle in Sri Lanka: Policy Options,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300089,7 February 2020,2020,Research Article,242.0

In the context of “deglobalization”, it is critically important to better understand the impacts of increasing trade costs on China’s economic transformation from the perspective of firms’ exports. In this study, we measure the trade costs of specific manufacturing sectors and provinces. We employ Heckman (1979) two-stage method and the data from China’s manufacturing firms to investigate the impacts of trade costs on heterogeneous firms’ exports. Based on these results, we further explore the impacts of trade costs on China’s economic transformation and discuss policy advisories. Our results indicate that the increase in trade costs have adverse impacts on China’s economic transformation. Specifically, increasing trade costs hinder firms’ export behaviors and export scales. However, these impacts are heterogeneous on different types of firms, which refers to the ownership reforms, manufacturing sector upgrades and coordinated regional development. In particular, increasing trade costs do not affect coordinated regional development in China, but they are not conducive to ownership reforms and manufacturing sector upgrades. Altogether, our findings provide the first evidence on the impacts of trade costs on China’s economic transformation from the perspective of firms’ exports, and also shed light on policy implications for promoting firms’ exports and economic transformation in the “deglobalization” period.","China is confronting with a growing global challenge toward “deglobalization” characterized with rising trade protectionism (Bekkers, 2019; Robinson & Thierfelder, 2019). In particular, the US announced in 2018 the measures for Section 301 of the Trade Act to China, imposing additional 25% tariffs on the products originating in China. Based on the Trump administration, the US views trade imbalances with China as the result of unfair trade (Lin & Wang, 2018; Salvatore & Campano, 2019). Despite the later progress in the trade negotiations between the two countries, no doubt, the changes in US trade policy would bring increasing trade uncertainties and additional costs to China’s exports.====Benefitting from free trade and, especially, from joining in the World Trade Organization (WTO), China’s exports have increased substantially. Moreover, China became the world’s largest exporting country in 2009. Exports have become an important driving force of China’s economic growth. Thus, as the micro subjects of exports, firms’ exports may be influenced by increasing trade costs.====At the same time, China is fully aware of bottleneck associated with traditional development mode, and has begun to change development mode, optimize economic structure and convert growth power (Hong & Li, 2017). The economic transformation is an important policy practice of economic development in China, and refers mainly to ownership reforms, manufacturing sector upgrades and regional coordinated development. For ownerships, it is necessary for the government to guide the reform of state-owned firms, support non-state-owned domestic firms and introduce foreign-funded firms. Among manufacturing sectors, China has comparative advantages in labor-intensive sectors, but these sectors use outdated technology and produce low value-added products. Technology-intensive sectors are the key sectors for the future development. For the regional development, it is important for policy-makers to increase the openness of the inland, central and western areas of the country, and promote coordinated regional development. Thus, from the perspective of firms’ exports, it is important to investigate whether increasing trade costs affect China’s economic transformation.====This study puts firms’ exports into this context, and explores the impacts of trade costs on China’s economic transformation from the perspective of firms’ exports. Specifically, we focus on the following issues: Do trade costs affect Chinese firms’ exports? What are the mechanisms through which trade costs affect firms’ exports? Do trade costs have heterogeneous impacts on firms’ exports across different ownership types, manufacturing sectors and provinces? Based on these results, we discuss how increasing trade costs affect China’s economic transformation and discuss policy advisories. This study sheds light on the important policy implications of promoting firms’ exports and China’s economic transformation in the “deglobalization” context.====In this study, we firstly use Cherniwchan’s (2017) method and combine foreign tariff changes with trade costs determined by geography to measure the trade costs of specific manufacturing sectors and provinces.====Then, we select the samples of Chinese manufacturing firms during the period 1998–2007.==== We employ this data and Heckman (1979) two-stage method to empirically investigate the impact of trade costs on Chinese firms’ export behaviors and export scales. In addition, we explore the mechanisms by which trade costs affect firms’ export scales, including firms’ entry and exit and the decisions of exports or domestic sales.====Finally, based on China’s economic transformation, we further examine the heterogeneous impacts of trade costs on firms’ exports for different ownership types, manufacturing sectors and provinces. Considering the ownership reforms in China, we divide samples into state-owned, non-state-owned domestic and foreign-funded firms. According to manufacturing sector upgrades, we divide samples into firms from technology-intensive, capital-intensive and labor-intensive sectors. Considering unbalanced regional development, we divide samples into coastal, inland, eastern, central and western firms. We also discuss the interacting impacts of trade costs across different ownerships, sectors and provinces. Based on these heterogeneous results, we explore how increasing trade costs affect China’s economic transformation, and further discuss policy implications of the results.====Altogether, we provide the first evidence on the impacts of trade costs on China’s economic transformation from the perspective of firms’ exports, and also provide important policy advisories. This study makes major contributions to existing literature at least in the following aspects. First, we combine foreign tariff changes with trade costs determined by geography to measure the sector-level and province-level trade costs of China. Second, from the perspectives of ownership types, manufacturing sectors and provinces, we analyze the heterogeneous impacts of trade costs on the exports of different types of firms. Third, we discuss the interacting impacts of trade costs across different ownership types, manufacturing sectors and provinces. Finally, based on the heterogeneous impacts of trade costs, we investigate the effects of increasing trade costs on China’s economic transformation from the perspective of firms’ exports. Given that the economic transformation is an important policy practice in China, our results provide important implications for policy-makers in the “deglobalization” period.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Amounting to around CHF 1.17 billion, such contributions account for more than a third of Switzerland’s total direct payments budget. The effectiveness and the efficiency of this policy in terms of both calorie production and income transfer were analysed. With the help of an agent-based model approach, the extent to which the achievement of targets is guaranteed in the long term was examined. Possible gains in efficiency become visible alongside a stepwise reduction in the levels of the contributions. If the current policy is continued, Switzerland will barely achieve its actual operationalised calorie production targets. A focus on demand during times of supply shortages and a stronger focus on maintaining production factors could release the resources necessary to close existing gaps in relation to meeting targets. With an income ratio of about 0.3, the payments have a high income transfer effect and, therefore, make a major contribution to securing agricultural income. This fact is not evident in either the formulation of targets or the labelling of the policy. The present study contributes to the discussion concerning the possible reasons and likely impacts for the mislabelling of this policy measure.","The majority of food security policies focus on vulnerable segments of the population. For example, the United States focuses on domestic household food security (Coleman-Jensen, Rabbitt, Gregory, & Singh, 2017), while the European Union concentrates on food security in developing countries (European Commission, 2010). India’s Public Distribution System (PDS) both targets food insecure consumers and attempts to serves as a minimum support to secure incomes for India’s producers (Debnath, Babu, Ghosh, & Helmar, 2018; Jha, Gaiha, Pandey, & Kaicker, 2013). An exception to this rule can be seen in the case of countries that offer very high subsidies to farmers. For instance, “food self-sufficiency” is the principal objective of the Japanese government’s “basic plan”, that is, its long-term agricultural policy concept (Fujibayashi, 2015). Likewise, the desire to ensure food security significantly influences Norway’s strong stance in the agricultural markets (Bråtveit, 2014). This paper considers the case of Switzerland’s food supply security payments, which represent the country’s most important tool for subsidising agricultural policy. At the same time, it is by far the most expensive pillar of the country’s food security policies.====In the prior literature, many cases of mislabelled policies have been identified. Assigning a misleading name to a policy (McIntyre & Pomp, 2008) or following an agenda that differs from the official agenda (Hess, 2018) has usually been considered as one of the weaknesses of a policy (Schmitt, 1988). However, the causes of such mislabelling remain insufficiently understood, while the effects of such a practice also remain unclear when it comes to policy effectiveness and efficiency.====Yet, it is well known that national agricultural policy always aims to achieve several goals. In addition to the declared objective and the target indicators to be measured in that regard, which provide information concerning the achievement of the objective, there are always other, either superior or inferior, objectives that can be achieved either directly or indirectly. One of the most important overarching objectives is certainly the income target associated with agricultural policy measures. Although farmers can certainly earn an income without state expenditure, transfer payments always result in an increase in their income. If this is the case, positive correlation between the security of the food supply target and the income target should be detectable. Moreover, the question of whether or not the resource allocation efficiency is greater in relation to food supply security than in relation to income growth remains. If this question were to be answered in the negative, it would indicate that the investigated policy measure had been mislabelled.====To address the abovementioned issues, in Section 2 we offer a historic explanation of Food Supply Security Payments (FSSP) in the context of Swiss agricultural and food security policy. Section 3 introduces the simulation model, SWISSland,==== which is used to show the policy instrument’s likely effect. Subsequently, Section 4 highlights the weak and arbitrary link between the payments and food supply security, as well as the much stronger link between the payments and farm income. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions regarding the effect of mislabelling policies in general.",Causes and impacts of the mis-representation of agricultural policy—The case of food supply security payments in Switzerland,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300065,5 February 2020,2020,Research Article,244.0

We use a unique data source: the survey data from World Economic Forum, to measure the efficiency of the financial markets and the quality of accounting standards. With this unique data, we demonstrate that financial markets and accounting quality are important factors of FDI inflow into a country. In particular, FDI is positively correlated with the strength of financial audits and reporting standards and venture capital availability for all countries. We also show that accounting quality measures are more important for developing and emerging countries than for developed countries. On the other hand, financial market measures, especially the access to venture capital, have a bigger impact in attracting FDI flow into developed countries. These results support the hypothesis that local financial markets and accounting quality affect FDI. The results have strong policy implications for governmental regulatory agencies.","The World Bank defines Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a long-term investment made by a company based in one country into a company based in another country. Multinational Corporations (MNCs) over the years, through FDI, have invested in multiple countries at the same time. They have done this either through cross-border acquisition, joint ventures with local firms, or establishing new facilities in the host countries. Investing overseas has contributed enormously to the rapid growth of multinational corporations. At the same time, Foreign Direct Investment has contributed to rapid economic growth in many countries. Because of this mutual benefit, from 1970 to the present, FDI has grown significantly and has been a major source of private capital and economic development in both developed and developing countries.====To become more competitive in attracting foreign investors into their markets, many countries have employed various strategies. For example, countries have liberalized their economies, privatized state-owned enterprise, joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), and negotiated regional economic trade bloc agreements to stay competitive in the global markets. The factors that drive a nation’s competitiveness on the world’s stage have been the subject of inquiry for many years. Some researchers focus on the macroeconomic (Alam & Shah, 2013; Asamoah, Adjasi, & Alhassan, 2016) and political institutional factors (Biglaiser & Staats, 2010; Jensen, 2003; McLean, Zhang, & Zhao, 2012; Sun, 2014) as key determinants of FDI. In this paper, we contribute to the academic literature of FDI by exploring other factors such as financial market efficiency and accounting qualities.====The efficiency of the financial market and the quality of accounting reports can be key factors affecting FDI. The role of an efficient financial market in reducing transaction costs, allocating resources efficiently, promoting economic growth, and enhancing economic activities has been studied extensively in the finance and economic literature (Greenwood & Jovanovic, 1990; Levine, 1997). Bruhn and Love (2014) show that easy access to banks and local equity market affects poverty and the labor market. La Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, and Shleifer (2006) demonstrate that an effective securities exchange market promotes stock market development and enhances economic growth. Meanwhile, strong investor and shareholder protection improves financial development and increases the availability of external financing (Brown, Martinsson, & Petersen, 2013; McLean et al., 2012), and good credit ratings attract investors to a company (Afonso, Furceri, & Gomes, 2012; Bolton, Freixas, & Shapiro, 2012). Studies have shown that a sound banking system plays a major role in enhancing economic activities and the overall economic growth of a country (Fatima, 2014; Bourkhis & Nabi, 2013).====The important role of accounting quality in a nation’s economic activities has been extensively documented in the literature. Among others, most accounting researchers have shown that accounting/reporting quality regulated accounting standards timely loss recognition, reduce smoothing or management of accounting numbers, and the ability of financial statements to capture and explain the stock price, returns, and value of the firm accurately reduces information asymmetry, increases transparency, market liquidity, equity valuation, and lowers the cost of capital (Barth, Landsman, & Lang, 2008; Bischof & Daske, 2013; Daske & Gebhardt, 2006; Jeanjean & Stolowy, 2008; Lambert, Leuz, & Verrecchia, 2007). Other studies indicate that high accounting/reporting quality increases the likelihood of cross-border merger (Erel, Liao, & Weisbach, 2012), and increases the financing and investing capacity of a firm (Balakrishnan, Core, & Verdi, 2014). This is similar to the conclusion of quality reporting standards found in the policy implications of the paper.====How to measure the efficiency of the financial market and the quality of accounting reports is a difficult question. In this paper, we use a unique data source: the survey data from World Economic Forum. With this unique database, we demonstrate that financial markets and accounting quality are important factors of FDI inflow into a country. In particular, FDI is positively correlated with the strength of financial audits and reporting standards, and venture capital availability for all countries. These results support the hypothesis that the local financial market and accounting quality affect FDI. This has strong policy implications for financial and accounting standards. The result also shows accounting quality is a stronger contributor for developing and emerging countries than for developed countries. On the other hand, access to the venture capital market has a bigger impact in attracting FDI flow into developed countries than developing countries.====We contribute to the literature of FDI in four significant ways. First, the paper goes beyond previous studies that only examine macro-economic and political institutional factors as key determinants of FDI. Instead this paper shows that domestic economic institutions such as financial markets and accounting quality are key determinants of FDI. GOVTREG is the ability of a government to formulate and implement regulations that promote private sector development. GOVTREG found that, using a logistic regression, this variable was significant at the 1 % level in this paper. This has strong policy implications for both developing and emerging market countries and less of an effect on developed countries. Second, the paper contributes to the debate that developing countries have more to gain in the global economy by improving the efficiency of their domestic economic institutions. Third, the paper contributes to the broader literature that domestic institutions matter in a global economy. Therefore, by making its domestic institutions efficient, a nation is more likely to be competitive in the global market. From a policy perspective, this is important as countries seek to attract FDI, this may be the time to focus on improving domestic economic institutions along with macro and political institutions. Fourth, the paper advances the debate over the key determinants of FDI, thereby adding to the literature for future consideration and research.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines our research design, Section 3 describes the sample selection procedure, Section 4 reports the empirical results, Section 5 discusses the policy implications, and Section 6 provides the conclusions of the paper.",Financial efficiency and accounting quality: The impact of institutional micro-factors on FDI,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300053,31 January 2020,2020,Research Article,245.0

For this purpose, we compare the macro dynamics of a benchmark NCM-DSGE model with the behaviour of the same model augmented with a ==== mechanism. Our simulation exercises show that the ==== mechanism can be regarded as an effective, though indirect, way to account for hysteresis in potential output. A fundamental policy corollary follows that central banks should pursue financial stability, rather than price stability, and target current output growth, rather than output gap. Such an unconventional result is obtained by a simple macroeconomic amendment to an otherwise conventional NCM-DSGE model.","The debate in macroeconomics and central banking in the 1990s was dominated by a synthesis between the major schools of thoughts of previous decades, namely New Keynesian Economics (NKE) and Real Business Cycle (RBC) (e.g. Goodfriend & King, 1997; Clarida, Galì, & Gertler, 1999; Romer, 2000; Taylor, 2000; Dixon, 2008; Woodford, 2009; Arestis & Mihailov, 2011). On the methodological side, the use of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models originally developed by RBC authors became the privileged analytical tool for macroeconomists. On the theoretical side, the need to focus on the maximising behaviour of an omniscient individual agent was maintained as fundamental theoretical pillar, while it was recognised that deviations from the long-run norm are possible in the short run. Institutional frictions, information asymmetries, price rigidities and other market imperfections may well slow down the pace of adjustment to the long run equilibrium, as stressed by the NKE economists. As a result, monetary policy is effective in the short run, and changes in the interest rate should be regarded as the key policy tool to target inflation, with monetary aggregates being determined residually. In the long run, monetary policies would only have nominal effects. Discretional fiscal policies are also considered very unfavourable. They would end up destabilising inflation expectations, thereby interfering with monetary policy decisions, while they would have no long-lasting effect on real variables. To sum up, the new consensus in macroeconomics (NCM) established between the early 1990s and the outbreak of the US financial crisis in 2007 was based on a hybrid model marked by Classical features in the long run, and weak Keynesian characteristics in the short run.====Today, NCM models are commonly adopted by most of central banks and international financial institutions around the world (e.g. Adolfson, Adersson, Lindé, Villani, & Vredin, 2007). And yet, as argued by Goodhart (2009, p. 829), the standard version of these models ‘largely eliminates any rationale for banks, financial intermediaries, or even money’. This major flaw, along with recurring forecast errors, gave rise to an intense debate in academic journals and on social media, which has led a number of leading economists to question standard macroeconomic models or suggest some radical amendments to them (we refer, among others, to Blanchard, 2016b, b; Blanchard, 2017a, b; Galí, 2017; Gürkaynak & Tille, 2017; Haldane, 2017; Keen, 2016; Korinek, 2015; Krugman, 2016; Lavoie, 2016; Lindé, Smets, & Wouters, 2016; Münchau, 2016; Romer, 2016; Wren-Lewis, 2016). Interestingly, some pioneering attempts to account for financial frictions, asymmetries and imperfections were made far before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), that is, between in the early 1980s and late 1990s. Financial institutions were regarded as possible amplifiers or triggers of the business cycle. The so-called ‘financial accelerator mechanism’ (FAM) literature was pioneered by Ben Bernanke and other NKE scholars (see, mainly, Bernanke, 1981, 1983; Bernanke & Gertler, 1989; Bernanke, Gertler, & Gilchrist, 1996; Bernanke, Gertler, & Gilchrist, 1999). No wonder if, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent worldwide crisis, the seminal work of Bernanke and his co-authors has been rediscovered and developed (see, among others, Tovar, 2009; Christiano, Motto, & Rostagno, 2013; Del Negro, Giannoni, & Schorfheide, 2014). However, the new works still rely on the benchmark NCM model, though additional frictions have been included.==== In fact, these frictions are what is seen to enable households to set both the desired supply of labour and wages, and firms to set both the supply of goods and prices. Since price-resetting is not instantaneous, socially sub-optimal results are likely to occur in the short run.====The aim of this paper is to provide a critical review of some recent developments in macroeconomics, while suggesting a few possible amendments to the benchmark model. This allows to shed light on some unexpected, but rather significant policy implications arising from it. The point is that the introduction of financial frictions in the benchmark NCM model through the so-called FAM is said to explain the increasing influence of financial markets in real-world economies. However, on closer inspection, the FAM is not as much a financial mechanism as an indirect way to account for hysteresis of the so-called ‘natural’ level of output (and employment). We discuss these original implications by estimating a reduced-form NCM-DSGE model. We then use computer simulations to compare the macro dynamics of a benchmark NCM-DSGE model with the behaviour of alternative specifications of the model, which are augmented with financial frictions. Our simulations reveal that central banks should favour financial stability to price stability, and target current output growth rather than the output gap. In the spirit of Lavoie (2006), we show that this conclusion can (in principle) be derived within a rather conventional NCM-DSGE model.====Accordingly, the rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we provide an outline of the benchmark NCM model. We describe the mechanics of the model through empirical estimation and computer simulation exercises. In Section 3 we examine the key features of the FAM literature, as an autonomous branch of NKE. To this purpose, we add a financial accelerator mechanism to the standard NCM model, and explore the long-lasting effects of aggregate demand shocks, via their impact on the balance-sheets of lenders (e.g. commercial and investment banks) and borrowers (e.g. non-financial firms). In Section 4 we discuss the role of the central bank in a financial frictions-augmented NCM model. We argue that any intervention that stabilises the collateral net wealth of the borrowers may help neutralise the destabilising effects of financial frictions. By contrast, focusing on output gap and price stability can be highly misleading, because the same output gap is consistent with infinite combinations of current growth and natural growth (once output hysteresis is accounted for).

A recent Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi report argued that policy decisions and welfare evaluations should be approached from a broader perspective on well-being and take into account metrics derived from self-reports of living conditions. To this end, we evaluate the efficacy of the 2014 social pension reform in South Korea using various measures of subjective well-being. The South Korean government introduced a basic old-age pension in 2008 and doubled its monthly benefits in 2014. The reform in 2014 represents one of the largest social welfare expansions in South Korean history, with an aim to improve seniors’ quality of life. Using data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging, we estimate a matched difference-in-differences model that isolates the causal effects of the benefit increase attributable to the reform. Results show that the reform was associated with an average of 4.8–5.7% increase in financial satisfaction among beneficiaries, and that this correlation was more pronounced for retirees, seniors above age 70, and those at the bottom of wealth distribution. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that satisfaction with health status, parent-child relationship, and overall quality of life has improved in response. Our findings are in contrast to the past evidence on objective welfare gains associated with pension expansion. Taken together this study calls for the use of self-reported well-being data in policy evaluation.","Since the publication of a report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress (Stiglitz, Sen, & Fitoussi, 2010), self-reports of subjective welfare has drawn renewed interests from policymakers as an alternative yardstick to measure societal progress. The essence of the report was that present measures of economic performance such as gross domestic product (GDP) or unemployment rate are insufficient indicators of societal progress, and that subjective well-being and other quality of life measurements should also be taken into account. Aggregate statistics that currently play a prominent role in policymaking does not reflect non-material dimensions of well-being. For many years, researchers have been puzzled by an apparent paradox that rising income is only weakly correlated with happiness in the long run (Easterlin, 1974). How well off people feel about their life depends on many factors that conventional income-based measures do not capture, such as health, social connections, environment, and political governance. The advocacy for objective indicators has encouraged an unbalanced focus on economic growth and policies that have proven to be unequal and not poverty-reducing. In order to assess whether policy intervention flourishes one’s life, policy modeling should employ measures that tell us the extent of improvements in human well-being.====This study evaluates the efficacy of social pension expansion in South Korea using measures of subjective well-being. The elderly poverty rate in South Korea is the highest among OECD countries (OECD, 2011), due in large part to the late introduction of the contributory national pension scheme (Lee, 2017) and high levels of labor market informality (United Nations, 2016). To alleviate high elderly poverty, the South Korean government introduced basic old-age pension (BOAP) in 2008 and doubled its monthly benefits beginning in July 2014. The BOAP is a non-contributory social pension that transfers flat-rate cash benefits to seniors at the bottom 60–70% of the income distribution, with an aim to stabilize their economic conditions. Prior research showed that cash transfer through social pension has improved the lives of the poor by increasing consumption, economic productivity, and access to healthcare. To date, there has been limited evidence on the association between poverty‐targeted social protection programs and subjective well-being.====We exploit the expansion of the BOAP in 2014 to isolate the causal effect of pension benefit increase on subjective well-being. Using data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA), the policy effect is estimated by comparing pre- vs. post-expansion changes in well-being outcomes between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Since the BOAP was established as voluntary benefits, a difference-in-differences (DD) model combined with propensity score matching (PSM) is used to identify treatment effects. The combination of these two methods accounts for time-invariant unobservables that lead to self-selection into the program, and compares only those with similar observable characteristics (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983). Subjective well-being is measured as a broad assessment of life in general, as well as regarding three specific domains: financial situation, health, and parent-children relationship. Examining financial satisfaction along with other measures of happiness allows us to investigate whether the well-being effect of income is limited to the financial domain or extends to other aspects of life.====There are two main findings. First, the reform to the BOAP was associated with higher financial satisfaction among beneficiaries. Through 2012 and 2014 a richer non-beneficiary group experienced a significant drop in financial satisfaction, whereas beneficiaries reported nearly the same assessment of their financial situation. Compared to the pre-expansion average, the reform was responsible for approximately a 4.8–5.7% increase in financial satisfaction. Second, correlations between the reform and other domains of satisfaction were small in magnitude and not robust to estimation methods. The correlations were statistically insignificant even in retirees, seniors above age 70, and those at the bottom of wealth distribution for which financial satisfaction increased to a greater extent. Overall, our results suggest that increases in public transfer income led to the financial peace of mind but did little to improve happiness.====This study contributes to the existing literature along several dimensions. First, our measures of subjective well-being encompass multiple domains. Most previous studies used a single measure of happiness and failed to examine which domains of subjective well-being responds to government support. Second, we use a nationally representative sample and a large policy change that has affected majority of seniors. We advance the previous studies that have often used a local-level policy change or small and selective samples. Third, this study examines the well-being effect of social pension in an industrialized and urbanized context. Most prior research studied African and Latin American experiences where non-contributory pensions were given more attention with broader coverage. Fourth, the 2014 social pension expansion in South Korea yields causal inference. The original proposal for the reform was to expand pension coverage to all seniors above age 65. As budgetary concerns arose, however, the universal coverage clause was removed and coverage was limited to the bottom 70% of the income distribution. Because this change was unannounced prior to implementation, given the plausible assumption that the original plan should have raised expectations in all age-eligible seniors our quasi-experimental framework yields estimate that is not confounded by changes in consumption behaviors in anticipation of an upcoming reform.",Social protection for happiness?

The advanced world has entered an era of demographic transition. Population growth in advanced economies is slowing down. Longevity is rising and the share of the elderly population is on the increase. Demographic changes together with new waves of innovation and automation are the two main forces expected to shape the macroeconomic and labour market conditions of the coming decades (Basso & Jimeno, 2018).====The unprecedented demographic transition is related to various aspects of economic activity. Population ageing is important for GDP growth, current account, savings, investment, inflation and labour force participation. The elderly used to make up a small share of total population. Technological progress and evolving social norms altered this demographic structure. This implies an even smaller share of the working age population in total population, with the ensuing changes in consumption and saving decisions of households (Bobeica, Nickel, Lis, & Sun, 2017). Elderly people consume less tradables relative to people in working age, such that aggregate consumption decreases. At the same time, the savings rate may fall by more than the fall in the investment rate because the elderly typically have lower savings than younger cohorts. Unless more people are incentivized to participate in the labour market to offset population ageing, real GDP growth could slow down. Likewise, if falling aggregate demand is not fully met by lower supply, population ageing will put downward pressure on inflation. A crucial question is how the balance of all those channels of influence will play out. The relationship between ageing and macroeconomic outcomes is thought to be mediated by the institutional context. Collective bargaining structures are a key determinant of wage developments and employment conditions (Traxler & Brandl, 2012). Furthermore, employment protection legislation plays its own part in determining labour force participation rates (Duval, Furceri, & Jalles, 2017). In an ageing population, another question arises as to whether the institutional context matters not only for labour force participation but for macroeconomic outcomes as well. The economic and financial crisis brought about new challenges, such as the decentralization of collective bargaining structures and labour market deregulation, which have for long been overlooked in the demographics context and now need to be accounted for.====The implications of population ageing for the conduct of monetary policy should not be sidestepped. Since lower inflation normally results in lower nominal interest rates, the deflationary forces triggered by demographic trends imply a higher probability of monetary policy being constrained (by the zero lower bound), in the medium-to-long term, in its ability to adjust the nominal interest rates (Bielecki, Brzoza-Brzezina, & Kolasa, 2018; Ferrero, Gross, & Neri, 2019). After the outbreak of the global financial crisis, nominal and real interest rates reached historical low levels. The recourse to unconventional measures in the face of the zero lower bound on interest rates, the major fiscal adjustment in the euro area periphery and the newly employed macroprudential tools to contain imbalances, have altered the dominant status quo. In the aftermath of such a deep and protracted crisis, policymakers and central banks began to rethink macroeconomic and monetary policy (Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, & Mauro, 2014) and, even more so, under the pervasive influence of population ageing and technological changes for policy making in the coming decades.====Until recently, empirical literature has primarily concentrated upon the link between demographic changes and macroeconomic outcomes in Japan and China where demographic developments have for long taken center stage in macroeconomic policy debate. However, in the wake of rising population ageing concerns among the OECD developed countries, the main focus of macroeconomic performance and monetary policy measures recently shifted towards demographics and – in particular – ageing (Börsch-Supan, Härtl, & Ludwig, 2014; Imam, 2015; Yoon, Kim, & Lee, 2014). Additionally, the relationship between collective bargaining regimes and macroeconomic outcomes has received less attention than the well-established links between collective bargaining regimes and labour market outcomes (Papapetrou & Tsalaporta, 2018; Visser, 2016). Overall, a panel data empirical analysis encompassing the currently pressing issues of population ageing amid collective bargaining decentralization concerns is missing so far in the literature. We account for this shortcoming and address policy challenges that lie ahead.====To derive policy prescriptions, the paper examines the impact of population ageing on macroeconomic outcomes (such as GDP growth, current account, savings, and investment), inflation and labour force participation using a sample of 23 OECD developed countries from 1960 to 2014. Its main novelty lies in taking a more general view in the empirical examination of the economic implications of ageing, such that has not been dealt with in the literature. As population ageing has important implications on macroeconomics, monetary policy and labour force participation, the focus is on policy recommendations to successfully address these challenges. In particular, our contribution is fourfold. Firstly, we account for the institutional framework and we explicitly include collective bargaining coordination as a control variable in the analysis. This is important as it mediates the relationship between demographics and the macroeconomic and labour market outcomes. Although it is widely recognized as influential determinant of labour market outomes and – potentially – macroeconomic performance, collective bargaining coordination has been rather sidestepped in the demographics literature. Secondly, we explicitly account for the labour force participation effects of ageing. The ageing of the workforce tends to reduce labour supply. Labour supply constitutes a key driver of economic growth rates and an important contributor to potential growth. This is particularly relevant in an era of automation and innovation marked by lower labour input shares. Thirdly, we investigate how the impact of ageing on real GDP growth rate varies across different subsamples. Countries are categorized according to population growth as a key measure of demographics status. Such a breakdown is, to our knowledge, innovative in the literature. Finally, the paper enriches empirical literature using a methodology that is novel in the demographics literature and accounts for cross-sectional and temporal dependence in the regressions’ disturbances, reflecting the currently increased interdependence among policies, institutions and countries. This crucial methodological issue has been so far disregarded in this literature.====The remainder of this analysis unfolds in the following structure: Section 2 reviews the literature on the macroeconomic outcomes of population ageing. Section 3 presents the methodology. Section 4 describes the dataset. Section 5 presents the empirical results while Section 6 concludes and focuses on policy implications.",The impact of population aging in rich countries: What’s the future?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893820300028,25 January 2020,2020,Research Article,248.0

Ramón y Cajal, 1, 41018 Sevilla, Spain,University of Seville, Departamento de Economía e Historia Económica, Spain","Received 6 January 2019, Revised 1 September 2019, Accepted 22 November 2019, Available online 19 December 2019, Version of Record 13 March 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpolmod.2019.11.001,Cited by (7), in different economic backgrounds of expansion and crisis. We find problems of spatially asymmetric transmission of monetary policy in the period 2008M10–2014M12 and note that different spatial responses might operate in favour of monetary policy or be indifferent to this policy.,"Monetary policy is designed and implemented in a spatial-blind manner, as if the political-economic space on which it exerts its impacts were uniform. However, it is highly unlikely that any policy is spatially-blind (see Hewings, 2014) since political-economic space is not uniform (see Mann, 2010). In fact, what the literature suggests regarding this issue is that monetary policy gives rise to different effects across geographical space because of the differing spatial intensity of monetary transmission mechanisms. Indeed, the differing degree of spatial operativity in the case of the interest rate channel has been found to depend on the spatial distribution of economic sectors (see Carlino & DeFina, 1998, 1999; Owyang and Wall, 2009; Ridhwan, de Groot, Rietveld, & Nijkamp, 2014; Rocha, Silva, & Gomes, 2011; Vespignani, 2015); in the case of the exchange rate channel on the spatial pattern of trade openness (see Vespignani, 2015), and in the case of the credit channel on the financial, banking and firm spatial structure (see Carlino & DeFina, 1998, 1999; Guo and Tajul, 2017; Owyang and Wall, 2009). Such heterogeneity in the spatial effects stemming from monetary policy has been studied extensively in its empirical dimension. A very recent review of this literature is provided by Dominguez-Torres and Hierro (2019). As regards the euro area, most recent studies on the cross-country effects on economic activity resulting from European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy, such as those by Cavallo and Ribba (2015), Boeckx, Dossche, and Peersman (2017) or Burriel and Galesi (2018), do indeed reveal heterogeneity in the cross-country responses analysed.====With the diverging spatial impacts that result from implementing ECB monetary policy having repeatedly been demonstrated, one question that follows is how these effects are spatially distributed and if countries are clustering around different levels of responsiveness to monetary policy. In other words, interest now lies in identifying and quantifying similarities and divergences in the impacts exerted by ECB monetary policy across countries. This is analysed by determining whether there are, or have been, ==== in the Eurozone. We define a monetary cluster as a set of countries whose main economic variables react in a similar fashion to a specific ECB monetary policy. Furthermore, interest has also shifted towards identifying which factors seem to influence the spatial distribution of such effects, that is, which factors give rise to monetary clustering and explain similarities and divergences in the impacts exerted by ECB monetary policy across countries. In addition to other issues detailed later on, the importance of determining whether monetary clusters exist in the Eurozone is related to the possible impact of such clusters on the monetary policy implemented by the ECB. Such an issue is of major political and economic significance within the current economic and political climate of the Eurozone.====The wide-ranging debate surrounding ECB policy is well known, with economists from both sides of the Atlantic having participated (Brunnermeier, James, & Landau, 2016; De Grauwe, 2011; Krugman, 2012; Stiglitz, 2016, to name but a few), and with the debate having even transcended to the judicial field. Since 2010, after the implementation of the first strictly unconventional measures, a major controversy broke out in Germany. In April 2011, the governor of the Bundesbank, Axel Weber, who was destined to succeed Trichet in the ECB, resigned for personal reasons, although it was speculated that he strongly disagreed with Merkel over the purchase of sovereign debt through the so-called Securities Market Program (SMP). In September 2011, the German board member Jürgen Stark, Chief Economist of the ECB, resigned due to his opposition to the public debt purchase policy, and by late August 2012, just after Draghi’s announcement of selective public debt purchase, known as Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), the President of the Bundesbank Jens Weidmann reportedly threatened to resign if Germany supported such measures. Opposition to these measures in Germany was such that an activist group of economists, citizens and German MPs, who had already lodged an appeal against the bailouts, filed a judicial appeal against the OMT, which proved to be the most effective and apposite measure adopted by the ECB throughout the crisis since, merely by announcing it and without it even having to be applied, it put an end to the sovereign debt crisis. The appeal was finally rejected by the German Federal Constitutional Court in 2016 after consultation with the European Court of Justice (see Sáinz de Vicuña Barroso, 2016).====Specifically, an analysis of monetary clusters might shed light on whether the controversy generated within the euro area regarding the nature of the measures implemented by the ECB since the break out of the economic and financial crisis is related to the differentiated spatial effects arising from monetary policy or whether, by contrast, it is related to ideological issues.====From a strictly scientific standpoint, identifying monetary clusters in the Eurozone and using them as an analysis tool helps us to gain deeper insights into a number of issues, beyond studying whether the monetary policy implemented by the ECB exerts a differential economic impact across countries. These issues include (1) the patterns of the spatial distribution of these effects, that is, the analysis of whether there are similarities in the effects identified across geographical space which result in the creation of groups of countries that display similar economic reactions to monetary policy, as well as the quantification of such similarities; (2) the factors which seem to shape the spatial distribution of monetary policy effects on economic activity and which explain cross-country similarities and divergences, and, finally, (3) whether the results to emerge might justify the discrepancies expressed by some countries, mainly Germany, in relation to ECB monetary policy or, in other words, whether the spatiality of monetary policy justifies different and even contrasting interests regarding the implementation of monetary policy within the Eurozone.====In the present paper, we aim to provide answers to the previous issues by using time-series techniques together with machine learning methods. Specifically, we apply autoregressive vector models, which allow us to overcome problems of simultaneity and endogeneity among outcome and policy variables, and cluster analysis methods. We use data from 2001 to 2017, dividing the analysis into three periods corresponding to three different monetary and economic contexts: a conventional monetary policy period (2001–2008); a non-conventional pre-quantitative easing monetary policy period (2008–2014); and a quantitative easing period (2015–2017). Such a threefold division allows us to go beyond existing studies and to examine whether the spatial dynamics of monetary policy and its drivers are time-varying or, by contrast, whether are static. Put differently, it allows us to analyse whether the distribution of the effects of monetary policy across countries exhibits a changing nature contingent on the monetary-economic context or whether it remains the same irrespective of such a context.====Moreover, adopting a cluster approach makes a further twofold contribution to the literature. First, it allows spatial patterns of the effects of monetary policy beyond the traditional cross-country dimension to be identified and quantified. Second, it also allows us to determine the nature of the factors driving the spatial distribution of these effects by identifying whether such factors display within-cluster commonality or whether, by contrast, they constitute country-specific singularities which, although specific to each country, give rise to similar impacts that ultimately translate into the conformation of clusters. This is done by analysing whether the clusters identified are profiled by explanatory variables through an analysis of variance (ANOVA).====The analysis is structured as follows: in section two, we describe the monetary policy implemented by the ECB since the Euro was put into circulation. The empirical analysis is then divided into three parts: (Section 3) definition and estimation of an autoregressive model in order to determine the cross-country impacts of monetary policy on output and prices; (Section 4) a clustering analysis of the spatial effects identified above, and (Section 5) an analysis on the factors explaining similarities and divergences across geographical space using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The final section sums up the conclusions to emerge from the previous analyses and outlines the consequences of such analyses for European monetary policy.",Are there monetary clusters in the Eurozone?

The findings suggest that the Turkish equity market is moderately integrated with the European market, while the other economies exhibit weak financial integration with Europe, supporting the idea that the partnership appears to have no effect on enhancing inter-market linkages for these economies. Therefore, these markets would be good destinations for international investors seeking attractive investment opportunities to diversify their equity portfolios. Structural changes in the cross-market integration do exist, which may be considered as a guide for international equity portfolio diversification over different subperiods. In addition, there is evidence of an increasing trend in conditional correlations for Egypt and Turkey, to varying degrees, over time, notably during the post global financial crisis of 2007–2008, thus revealing herding behavior during this period. Overall, investors should be wary of the variation of equity market integration over time before engaging in an investment at the level of portfolio management and diversification. Policymakers must be aware of the remoteness of the current achievements of the Euro–Mediterranean Partnership from the targets set in terms of financial development and economic growth.","Scholars are devoting increased attention to the Euro–Mediterranean Partnership (EMP)==== and the incentives that lead countries to negotiate bilateral and multilateral agreements within the region. Most of this literature focuses on the human, social, and political aspects of the partnership, by analyzing how it guarantees security and affects cultural and educational institutions (see FEMISE, 2011). A second research stream examines economic aspects of the EMP, especially how it affects macroeconomic stabilization, long-term productivity, competitiveness, and deregulation of economic activity (see Romagnoli & Mengoni, 2014). Most studies agree that the partnership encourages Southern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern (SMME) countries to adopt economic and structural reforms. However, efforts toward privatization and economic deregulation remain lethargic, which brings into question the economic benefits of the EMP (see Hoekman, 2005). Other studies focus on the EMP’s impact on trade liberalization. Since commencement of the partnership, annual exports from (to) the South Mediterranean partners to (from) the European Union (EU) have increased. However, these southern countries have imported more from the EU than they have exported to it (see Behr, 2010). The EMP thus has delivered mixed results on economic growth and development in the region (see Kern & Salhi, 2011a).====We argue that, for this multilateral partnership to yield greater benefits, more attention should be paid to the financial sector, which the literature clearly links to economic development. Levine (2005), for instance, points out the positive effect of a developed financial sector on macroeconomic variables such as productivity, growth, and poverty reduction. Surprisingly, research that analyzes financial markets in the Euro–Mediterranean region and the implications of the EMP on these markets is scarce. How financial markets operate and compete is rapidly changing as competition increases. However, taking into account these changes and fostering a healthy and dynamic financial sector is one of the key factors in achieving economic growth and job creation in the Mediterranean region. Hence, researchers should devote greater attention to financial markets because of significant interdependence between financial development and economic growth in this region (see El-Wassal, 2005; Levine & Zervos, 1998; Pagano, 1993).====This paper examines whether the EMP affects inter-relations and integration of selected stock markets in the Euro–Mediterranean region. The present research is related to several strands in the theoretical and empirical literature. One implication of this research relates to the linkages and integration among stock markets. Due to the gradual liberalization of financial markets that contributes to creating more opportunities for global international investment, there is increasing interest in investigating relationships among financial markets. The main objective of this literature is to understand better the interrelationships among markets to recognize interesting investment opportunities, such that increasing integration among equity markets may decrease the advantages of international portfolio diversification. Numerous studies focus on developed markets, such as the US, Japan, and major European markets (see Baele, 2005; Bartram, Taylor, & Wang, 2007; Boubaker, Jouini, & Lahiani, 2016; van Ewijk & Arnold, 2015).====Other papers investigate integration and interdependence across emerging markets. Most of these studies focus on Central and Eastern European or Asian markets (see Bekaert & Harvey, 1997; Gan, 2014; Gjika & Horváth, 2013; Guidi & Ugur, 2014; Jouini, 2015; Worthington & Higgs, 2004). However, there is little interest shown in the literature in studying stock market behavior in the Euro–Med region, due to lack of data and to these markets’ relatively recent opening to foreign investors. Maghyereh and Al-Zoubi (2004) use a VAR-EGARCH to examine dynamic interdependence among four stock markets (Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, and Turkey). Their results show strong linkages among these markets at the volatility level. Darrat, Elkhal, and Hakim (2000) examine the pattern and the extent of interdependence of the markets of Morocco, Egypt, and Jordan. These authors find a high degree of co-movements among these stock markets. Integration among equity markets within the Middle East region is also documented by Darrat and Pennathur (2002). However, more recent studies show that regional dependence among most Middle East and North African (MENA) countries is weak. Alkulaib, Najand, and Mashayekh (2009) use a state-space model to investigate the relationship among some MENA countries, notably Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey, and find no linkages among North African financial markets. However, they show a bi-directional causality between the Turkish and Lebanese stock markets, while Jordan is not influenced by the other markets. Neaime (2002, 2012), and Lagoarde-Segot and Lucey (2007) confirm the weak linkages among most stock markets in the Euro–Med region.====Another strand of the literature investigates not only linkages among Euro–Med stock markets, but also with developed countries. Yu and Hassan (2008) use a multivariate GARCH model to examine the structure of interdependence and transmission of equity returns and volatility between seven MENA stock markets (including Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey) and three major developed markets (the US, the UK, and France). These authors provide strong evidence of a long-run equilibrium relation between Euro–Med markets and the US market. Moreover, according to their results, the US stock market significantly affects the volatility of most of these markets. Cheng, Jahan-Parvar, and Rothman (2010) find, however, less conclusive results, with Israel and Turkey the most strongly integrated with world financial markets. Graham, Kiviaho, Nikkinen, and Omran (2013) also find a modest degree of co-movements of stock returns between the US and Egypt and Jordan during the study period, but with an increasing trend of international capital market co-movements toward the end of the stock return series. Neaime (2012, 2016) focuses on the global financial crisis to assess its impact notably on some MENA stock markets. This author finds, especially, that Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Morocco were the countries most affected by the 2007–2008 financial crisis due to their important exposure to the European and US financial sectors.====This study sets forth several significant improvements and extensions to the literature. In particular, it is the first, to our knowledge, to assess not only the dynamic integration of individual Mediterranean stock markets with the European stock market, but also the first to examine the potential effect of the EMP on these links. Moreover, contrary to previous works, our analysis uses a large sample of data. The present paper examines integration among five stock markets in the SMME region (Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Malta, and Turkey) with European markets during the period from January 1, 1998 through December 1, 2016. Studying these markets over the whole period offers a more complete picture of the evolution of the links of these markets to the European market, and allows us to examine whether the 2007–2008 global financial crisis affects the integration process. For this purpose, we use the DCC-FIEGARCH methodology==== that has the advantage to allow past shocks to have asymmetric effects on conditional volatility, to capture the time-varying conditional correlations between stock returns, and to allow for long-range volatility dependence (see Conrad, Karanasos, & Zeng, 2011).====The results indicate that the Turkish stock market is most integrated with the European market, and that the integration level remains relatively moderate over the study period. However, the integration level is considerably weak for the other stock exchanges, suggesting that the EMP, known as the UfM, appears to have no significant effect on these markets. Moreover, the results also show changes in the integration level over time, implying that international equity portfolio diversification is regime-dependent. For the Egyptian and Turkish markets, we find an increase in correlation during the period following the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, thus supporting contagion effects between these markets and the European market. The results have important implications for investors who seek good destinations to diversify their stock portfolios internationally, and for policymakers to manage contagion risks.====The paper proceeds by presenting, in Section 2, the EMP and a discussion of its implications for economic and financial integration within the region. Section 3 describes the empirical methodology used to assess the interactions between each of the SMME markets and the European stock market. Section 4 presents the data and discusses empirical results. Finally, Section 5 sets forth our conclusions and implications of the results.",Does the Euro–Mediterranean Partnership contribute to regional integration?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819301310,15 December 2019,2019,Research Article,250.0

The paper uses a database detailing the different sources of campaign funding for French members of Parliament to analyze their relative performance. Results show a large variance in campaign resource management ability, particularly between political parties, and incumbents and newcomers. They also reveal an important role of constituencies’ characteristics and of politicians' experience in explaining differences between politicians' efforts. Thus, public policies could promote virtuous regulations to reduce disparities among candidates with different financial backgrounds and access to resources, to foster a fairer democracy.","“A buck is a buck is a buck”. The literature on campaign spending is based on this common premise. Although this may sound a natural starting point, it implies that all the money politicians spend delivers the same vote-buying power. If true, then money would buy elections, and democracy would be at the mercy of the wealthiest, yielding a plutocracy. Though examples exist of billionaires entering the political scene and winning elections, the thrust of the evidence, however, shows that such self-financed politicians are more often defeated than elected (Steen, 2009), and this seems attributable to their lack of knowledge of how (and maybe also when exactly during the campaign) to spend their money. This hints to an experience premium for politicians that is independent of their wealth. Such a premium does not promote a fair democracy, and could engineer low turnouts, and root out the support democratic institutions receive. Hence, the issue raises more questions than those related to policy, it also points to a democratic challenge.====The promotion of democratic ideal would then induce the institutions to propose and defend a policy implemented through laws and regulation that level the field for all candidates. That is, all candidates should have, in principle at least, the chance of winning an election, given their pre-condition. To feed such a reflection on equal opportunity for candidate, one has to know and understand how the playing field works. In other words, we have to identify and discriminate between what is “fair” competition and what is “unfair” advantage when it comes to resources. To do this, one might look at the working of the electoral process, the campaign itself, and how the resources would affect the outcome. It appears that all dollars are not equal and dealing with the total might not be enough to elaborate an optimal policy.====Unfortunately, the literature on campaign spending, considering that all dollars have the same value, stumbles on a puzzle: It has been observed repeatedly, starting with Jacobson (1978), that challengers get more votes for every dollar spent than incumbents. This appears in various settings and using different econometric methodologies (e.g., Pattie & Johnston, 2008, for UK, Benoit & Marsh, 2008, for Ireland), although Levitt (1994) finds that, in repeated contests, campaign spending barely influences US election outcomes.====In our view, this rests on the premise of an equal value of a dollar for every politician, while it is possible that politicians may not spend the same way depending on the circumstances of the electoral competition. All dollars spent do not bring the same return. For instance, a dollar spent in a disputed riding may not bring the same electoral return as one spent in a stronghold. Hence, candidates can be considered as producers having to use their resources to get elected or reelected. From the economist’s point of view, candidates transform resources into votes using some “campaign technology” so that the frontier of that production set gives the maximum vote that can be obtained from the resources available. The distance to the frontier would then measure the supplementary resources used to get elected relatively to the reference electoral practices. In other words, candidates not located on the frontier, somehow, use more resources than others to get the same electoral result.====The resource management we mentioned above refers to “efficiency” of the candidate with respect to electoral campaign expenditures. That is, if we can observe money spent and resources used, then the relative performance of all candidates can be assessed. Most efficient candidates (those who spend less for the votes they get) form the set containing the best practices. The rest of them are using more resources for reasons to be identified. There are two phenomena entangled in this approach, however: (i) Candidates involved in hard-fought ridings would tend to spend more to get the marginal votes, a phenomenon that may not be observed in strongholds; (ii) Candidates can improve on their use of money compared to other candidates. In both cases, the candidates are not on the frontier, but for fundamental reasons that we need to identify. Clearly, it is only in the second case that we are faced with true “inefficiency”. Candidates, to get elected, combine resources to organize and run their campaign. There are many combinations leading to the same electoral results. However, they are not equivalent from a resource management perspective. Some candidates might choose to save on resources while others might be more lenient. For example, candidates in strongholds can manage resources to get elected on a bargain and they would be deemed efficient by standard efficiency measures. It is also possible for candidates in strongholds to simply waste resources. This is the standard concept of efficiency in production economics.====Key to our argument, however, is that standard production economics efficiency analysis would not be able to distinguish between wasted resources and resource allocation in disputed districts and strongholds. Thus, the identification problem applies to all districts: performance of candidates may end up far from best practices, but for fundamentally different reasons.====Our contribution is to disentangle the marginal impact of spending to attract votes from resource management efficiency of the candidate. The DEA method is an adequate method to study the use of campaign resources by candidates searching for electoral success. The method also allows us to rank the relative performance of the candidates. Such a method has been used by Coates (1999), who was studying the impact of aggregate spending of candidates to the 1994 US Congress election. Here, we go a step further in the use of the DEA method, implementing a multi-input/multi-output production vote technology and allowing incumbents and challengers to have different resource management skills, which is the most natural way to look at the incumbency premium. Then, we use a two-step DEA procedure to decompose standard efficiency scores to identify the determinants of the resource management performance. These can be decomposed into two categories: the district specific circumstances and the candidate management-related characteristics. While the district specific effect constitute a level playing field, it is the same for all candidate, and does not require intervention from a policy point of view, the management-related characteristics might do. This is an empirical question and knowing the mechanics would likely feed the reflection on what constitute a policy that offer equal opportunity to all candidates.====We apply this methodology to the campaign spending of 481 candidates elected in the 2002 French legislative election. The data we use is an original database that allows us to disentangle the resources used by candidates by their nature. In particular, we can differentiate between endowments in kind, donations, party contributions, and personal loans obtained from banks. Receiving contributions from the party cannot be assimilated, in one's mind as well as in reality, with a credit obtained from the local bank. As a consequence, we expect politicians to manage their funds with different degrees of abilities and efforts depending on their origins and on the (legal and political) context in which they evolve. Politicians receiving money from different sources can only perceive that the different types of funds come at different costs, if only opportunity costs.====Although Palda and Palda (1998) and Foucault and François (2005) also focus on the French legislative election, these authors (as most of the literature) use a different methodology and cannot differentiate between the different sources of funds used during campaigns. An exception is Epstein and Franck (2007) who focus on the determinants of elected French MPs’ using campaign resources data. They find that the amount of contributions received by candidates are the key factors to be qualified to the second round of the election but are not decisive to win the election. They look at the marginal electoral impact of the contributions. They, however, do not include the resource management efficiency in their analysis.====Our results contribute to elucidating the paradox mentioned above of the apparent ineffectiveness of incumbents’ campaign spending, something Stratmann (2009) qualifies as “one of the major puzzles in the political economy literature”. We show that incumbents are more efficient than newcomers, which supports a view of politics as a career (Mattozzi & Merlo, 2008). Thus, not only we aim at showing the role the DEA method could play in the political economy literature concerned with efficiency, but also we show that going deeper by looking at the different kinds of funds a politician can obtain is a worthwhile effort.",The politician and the vote factory: Candidates’ resource management skills and electoral returns,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819301279,4 December 2019,2019,Research Article,251.0

Nevertheless, its fruition remains quite limited with perhaps only Tunisia being actually seen as a (partial) success (Guedoir, 2018), Morocco, Algeria and some GCC countries have witnessed minor democratic improvements, while Yemen, Libya and Syria remain in armed conflicts (Turan, 2018). All the while, the more populous Egypt is being hurled through numerous political changes from the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, to the re-establishment of authoritarian rule (Pratt & Rezk, 2019). In the wake of these changes, Egypt witnessed a potential loss in GDP per capita growth rate over the years 2011–2017 of about 12% (Echevarria & Garcia-Enriquez, 2019).==== Egypt has also witnessed rises in informal employment for both high- and low-educated workers (Elsayed & Wahba, 2019).====The large shadow economy has already been linked to political instability through losses in tax-income and consequently decaying infrastructure and has been attributed as one possible cause for the Arab Spring (Farzanegan & Badreldin, 2017). Thus, it is quite prudent of post-Arab Spring governments to find policies to reduce and control the shadow economy and not allow it to grow out of hand since this may well lead to a new wave of unrest.====The current Egyptian government under President Abdelfattah Al-Sisi has embarked on a path of economic liberalization with the aim of creating employment and ensuring economic and political stability. This has also been internationally driven since the approval of an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in 2016 for a sum of US$ 12 billion, which includes a number of economic liberalization policies such as floating the exchange rate, reducing fiscal deficits, introducing a new value-added tax (VAT) and reducing energy subsidies.==== Such liberalization steps are known to have an effect on the shadow economy (Momani, 2018), yet the direction of that effect itself, remains unclear: On the one hand, higher VAT and income taxes are known to push people towards the informal sector and numerous arguments in the literature undermine the constructive contribution of economic liberalization in dealing with the shadow economy. Studies such as Carr and Chen (2002), Goldberg and Pavcnik (2003) and Bacchetta, Ernst, and Bustamante (2009) suggest that economic liberalization may increase the size of the shadow economy through intensifying competition, increasing costs, and under-privileging domestic low-skilled labor to the global work force. On the other hand, much literature shows that growth-driven economic liberalization may move people out of the informal sector by creating more formal employment opportunities, increasing productivity, reducing labor market rigidities, improving institutional quality, increasing wages, and reducing trade restrictions (Aleman-Castilla, 2006; Dreher, Kotsogiannis, & Martens, 2009; Geronazzo, 2016; Melitz, 2003).====Given the ambiguity surrounding the relationship between economic liberalization and the shadow economy in general, and the absence of empirical studies that have addressed the effects of economic liberalization policies in Egypt in specific, this study aims to test whether policies taken to liberalize the Egyptian economy are indeed able to reduce the size of the shadow economy in Egypt.====Our study sheds light on the historical impact of economic liberalization==== on the development of the shadow economy==== in Egypt using time series data from the period of economic liberalization in 1976 until post-Arab Spring in 2013. Our aim is to learn from historical data and observations on how previous liberalization policies have affected the shadow economy. We use an innovative approach that traces the response of Egypt’s shadow economy to a positive development in Egypt’s economic liberalization over the following years. Our estimated impulse response functions (IRF), based on a vector autoregressive model (VAR), show a negative (decreasing) response of the shadow economy to a positive development in economic liberalization. This response is statistically significant for the first three years directly following the shock, lending support to such policies’ effect in bringing down the shadow economy in Egypt, at least in the short-term. We test the long-term effects by conducting a bounds test based on the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method and confirm long-term associations between economic liberalization and the shadow economy. Our results support the importance of promoting economic liberalization to address the sizable shadow economy in Egypt.====The findings of this paper should act as direct policy recommendations as to whether the Egyptian government (or other developing countries) should pursue such economic liberalization strategies as a method of (indirectly) reducing participation in the shadow economy (leading to higher government revenues and political stability). We suggest to explicitly condition international development assistance to Egypt on demonstrable policy actions with respect to economic liberalization to ensure the sustained economic development and political stability required for moving Egypt into the more successful countries of the Arab Spring and reduce the probability of defaulting on foreign financing.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of related literature on the relationship between liberalization and the shadow economy and economic liberalization efforts in Egypt. Section 3 focuses on the data and methodology. We present and discuss the results in Section 4. Section 5 covers some policy recommendations.

A novel procedure of testing for recurrent explosive behavior is implemented in order to identify episodes of explosive debt dynamics. The detected periods of explosive debt growth can be attributed to changes in economic, political and institutional environment which required active policy responses subsequently followed by fiscal adjustments. The results of the study indicate that the long-run sustainability found for these countries in other studies can be interpreted as the outcome of fluctuating fiscal policies, some of which were unsustainable.","Studies of fiscal sustainability have gained momentum recently, especially in the context of monetary policy rates reaching the zero-lower bound in many countries. Analyses based on the fiscal theory of the price level suggest that active (or unsustainable) fiscal policy can be viewed as an alternative to active monetary policy (see, e.g., Davig & Leeper, 2011). It is an interesting paradigm shift that contrasts with the previous approach, according to which an unbalanced intertemporal budget constraint of the public sector was perceived purely as a threat to economic stability and as something that should generally be avoided.====Many authors have contributed to the empirical analysis of fiscal sustainability since the seminal paper of Hamilton and Flavin (1986). Most contributors analyzed long-run dynamic properties of public debt, deficit, revenues and expenditures, identifying their order of integration and testing cointegration relations. The reason behind this approach is an observation that debt being stationary or integrated of low order is consistent with conditions of fiscal sustainability. Bohn (2007) criticized this approach, demonstrating that debt being integrated of any order guarantees fiscal solvency, while unsustainability implies explosive debt dynamics. As an alternative to the stationarity and cointegration analysis of fiscal variables Bohn (2007) proposed a testing procedure based on a policy reaction function.====Fiscal sustainability by definition is a long-run condition (see, e.g., a discussion in Wyplosz, 2005). Nevertheless, evidence of fiscal sustainability that is based on the long-run history is not inconsistent with the existence of unsustainable (explosive) dynamics of public debt in the short run. Eventual fiscal adjustments must bring the debt dynamics back to a sustainable path. The traditional methods of stationarity and cointegration analysis or methods based on a time-invariant reaction function are not designed for modeling transitory unsustainable dynamics of public debt.====In what follows the long-run fiscal sustainability is defined as the historical dynamics of public debt that is consistent with the intertemporal budget constraint of the public sector unconditionally of implemented policy regimes. It can be interpreted as the outcome of the interaction of fiscal policies with economic environment. If debt is not to explode in the long run, policy makers have to respond to changing rates of economic growth and rates of interest by fiscal adjustments. The ability of fiscal authorities to control debt, rather than the implementation of a single policy, results in the long-run fiscal sustainability.====In this paper, a novel methodology of testing for recurrent explosive behavior (Phillips, Shi, & Yu, 2015) is implemented in order to identify episodes of explosive debt behavior for three advanced industrial economies with long fiscal records: Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Numerous studies, which are based on long time series, find evidence in favour of fiscal sustainability in these economies (see, inter alia, Ahmed & Rogers, 1995; Bohn, 2008; Hatemi-J, 2002). Nevertheless, the results presented in this paper indicate that there were multiple episodes when the public debt took an unsustainable path in consequence of adverse economic and political events. Detected episodes of explosive debt dynamics were transitory and the public debt was brought back to a sustainable path. These results suggest that active fiscal policies, which might be seen as unsustainable in the long run, were implemented in response to adverse shocks. Each episode of active fiscal policy was followed by fiscal adjustments and the long-run fiscal sustainability was restored.====In the next section, we present a brief literature review, with a special focus on the fundamental assumptions underlying empirical analysis of fiscal sustainability. In the third section, we argue that in the analysis of long-run fiscal history unsustainability (explosiveness) should be modeled as a transitory phenomenon which may recur if adverse events affect an economy and an active (unsustainable) fiscal policy response is required. In subsequent sections, we present the methodology of testing for recurrent explosive behavior, the data and the results. The detected episodes of explosive debt behavior are analyzed from the perspective of their causes and implemented fiscal adjustments.

Tests, by contrast, are ====, for they are based on a sample of past data. In the event of conflicting results, indicators may signal the occurrence of a structural change in policy, which may reverse the predictions of tests. Whether the results from indicators or from tests should be given priority in the assessment of the sustainability of public debt will thus depend on the structural stability of the historical data generating process of the primary surplus. Only in the absence of a structural break in the stance of fiscal policy, the potential warning predictions of fiscal indicators should be interpreted as merely reflecting transitory factors to be eventually reversed. An application to U.S. post-World War II historical data, from 1948 to 2016, and forecasts, from 2017 to 2027, demonstrates the empirical relevance of the proposed comprehensive approach and helps add new insights to the evaluation of the U.S. fiscal position. In particular, our results suggest that the potentially unsustainable course of U.S. fiscal policy from 2008 onwards, advocated by the use of fiscal indicators, reflects systematic—not cyclical—factors. The main policy implication is that deficit increases in the U.S. from 2008 onwards cannot be regarded as a transitory phenomenon and hence do entail an urgent need for a structural change in the future stance of budgetary policy.","The sustainability of fiscal policy arguably is one of the most debated and controversial issues in current macroeconomics. As emphasized by Wyplosz (2011), “along with price stability, low unemployment and balanced growth, external and public debt sustainability is an essential attribute of good macroeconomic policies. Debt sustainability may be seen as a pre-condition of all the other attributes”. Ensuring that activist budgetary policies, aimed to offset the negative peaks of business cycles beyond the operation of the automatic stabilizers, can be conducted without creating the potential for government bankruptcy is at the core of sound fiscal policy-making. Potential intertemporal imbalances about the course of budgetary policies are also a key source of interdependences between fiscal and monetary policies, for they may exert pressures on monetary authorities to create inflation taxes in order to alleviate the burden of public debt on future generations (see Canzoneri, Cumby, & Diba, 2011; Leeper & Leith, 2017).====Since at least the high debt levels experienced by several developed economies over the early 1980s (see Azzimonti, De Francisco, & Quadrini, 2014), considerable concern over increasing government debt and deficits and their potential negative consequences for macroeconomic and price stability has traditionally been visible both in the modern academic literature and in the policy debate. The need to monitor the evolution of budgetary policies is now urgently pressing, because of the rapidly growing public debt-GDP ratios observed in several OECD economies in the aftermath of the Great Recession erupted in 2008–2009.====However, the sustainability of public debt poses remarkable challenges to public policy design and monitoring. In particular, from an empirical perspective, two possible strategies for a quantitative evaluation of fiscal sustainability, based on the government intertemporal budget constraint, appear to be worth pursuing. One strategy is to construct indicators of fiscal sustainability, along the lines originally suggested by Miller (1983), Buiter (1985, 1987), Blanchard (1990), and Buiter, Corsetti, and Rubini (1993).==== The other is to implement tests for fiscal solvency, following the seminal works by Hamilton and Flavin (1986), Trehan and Walsh (1988, 1991), and Bohn (1998).==== The indicators presented in the literature are either simple measures mainly based on current information and published forecasts, or summary values of model-based projections of future paths of fiscal policy (Canofari, Piergallini, & Piersanti, 2018; Polito and Wickens, 2011, 2012). The testing techniques so far employed involve unit root tests (Hamilton & Flavin, 1986; Wilcox, 1989), cointegration analysis of fiscal data (Daniel & Shiamptanis, 2013; Trehan & Walsh, 1988, 1991), or require model-based sustainability approaches (Leeper & Li, 2017; Bohn, 1998, 2008; D’Erasmo, Mendoza, & Zhang, 2016; Ghosh, Kim, Mendoza, Ostry, & Qureshi, 2013; Mauro, Romeu, Binder, & Zaman, 2015; Mendoza & Ostry, 2008; Piergallini & Postigliola, 2013).====The novelty of this paper is to show that indicators and tests to assess the sustainability of public finances should not be used alternatively and may usefully be integrated into a unified approach. The simultaneous use of indicators and tests provides, in fact, additional information on the issue of government solvency. Indicators and tests reinforce each other when their predictions are not in conflict. However, in the event of conflicting results, indicators may signal the occurrence of a change in policy, which may reverse the predictions of tests. This is because indicators, contrary to tests relying on historical data, respond to a set of current and expected future conditions. For this reason, indicators are faster than tests in responding to changes in fiscal policy regimes. The key point is that a change in regime should cause a structural break in the data generating process of the primary surplus, which can be detected empirically.====On these grounds, we demonstrate that there is scope for designing a strategy to combine the potentially different results of indicators and tests. To evaluate its empirical relevance, we provide an application to U.S. post-World War II budget data. Analyzing the case of U.S. fiscal policy is particularly appropriate, for the sudden deterioration in U.S. budget deficits in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, aimed to offset the macroeconomic impact of the Great Recession, has given rise to renewed and widespread concerns over the question of sustainability (e.g., Aldama & Creel, 2019; Elmendorf & Sheiner, 2017). Specifically, our results reveal the occurrence of a structural change in U.S. fiscal behavior, which from our empirical analysis endogenously and unambiguously emerges in 2008, the central year of the Great Recession, featuring Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy. We show that the occurrence of such a structural break is a critical signal in favor of the ==== hypothesis, because it leads us to accept the unsustainability predictions of our forward-looking indicators, and to infer that the potentially unsustainable course of U.S. fiscal policy from 2008 onwards, suggested by the use of fiscal indicators, reflects ====—not cyclical—factors. The main policy implication is that deficit increases in the U.S. from 2008 onwards cannot be regarded as a transitory phenomenon and hence do entail an urgent need for a structural change in the future stance of budgetary policy.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 synthetically provides the baseline empirical framework, whereby indicators and tests are adopted by the literature as disjoint, and then presents the strategy to combine their use. Section 3 develops the empirical application and derives new insights for the evaluation of the U.S. fiscal position.

Alexander (1952) points out that the improvement of trade balance may be a result of switching expenditure from foreign to domestic goods due to a change of terms of trade following currency devaluation. It is documented that the US trade balance reversed from a trade surplus in 1970 to a trade deficit in 1971. The US policy makers decided to devalue the dollar to correct the trade deficit in 1971. However, the trade deficit had not been reduced and even worsened in the following year. Magee (1973) points out that there exists a J-curve effect due to pre-arranged currency-contracts followed by pass-through and quantity adjustment lags. Junz and Rhomberg (1973) also argue that the adjustment of trade flows in response to currency devaluation is composed of five lags, namely recognition lag, decision lag, delivery lag of payments, replacement lag and production lag. Magee (1973) and Junz and Rhomberg (1973) provide reasonable explanations to the short-run deterioration and long-run improvement of trade balance following currency devaluation.====To investigate the effectiveness of currency devaluation as a policy tool to improve a country’s trade balance, the conventional practice is to estimate the exchange rate (price) elasticities. If the sum of absolute value of the exchange rate (price) elasticities of export and import demand exceed unity, then it satisfies the Marshall-Lerner condition for an improvement of trade balance following currency devaluation. In the short-run, both price elasticities of export and import demand are inelastic and the sum is less than unity that deteriorates the trade balance. In the long-run, the price elasticities become more elastic with the sum exceeds unity that improves the trade balance. The seminal paper by Magee (1973) sparks a series of studies on the J-curve phenomenon to investigate the short- and long-run dynamics of trade balance after currency devaluation. A vast amount of studies has investigated the impacts of dollar devaluation to US trade balance, however, empirical results and policy implications are mixed (Bahmani-Oskooee & Brooks, 1999; Bahmani-Oskooee & Ratha, 2004; Chiu, Lee, & Sun, 2010; Demirden & Pastine, 1995; Magee, 1973; Mahdavi & Sohrabian, 1993; McKinnon, 2007; Moffett, 1989; Qiao, 2007; Rose & Yellen, 1989).====Most early empirical studies of price or income elasticities are confined to the balance of trade or trade in goods. Some recent studies start utilizing services trade data to estimate price and income elasticities (Deardorff, Humans, Stern, & Xiang, 2001; Mann, 2004; Marquez, 2006). Marquez (2006) points out that services and goods are different in nature and the exchange rate (income) impact on the trade in goods does not necessary apply to the trade in services. To this end, this study employs a new approach developed by Cheng, Kim and Thompson (2013) to revisit the effectiveness of using currency devaluation to improve trade balance by estimating the exchange rate (price) elasticities of services trade between the US and rest of the world with quarterly disaggregated services trade data from 1999 to 2015. In addition, we also follow the conventional trade model specification to estimate the income elasticities of services trade.====Aggregation bias is a major shortcoming of estimating a trade model with aggregate trade data (Ardalani & Bahmani-Oskooee, 2007; Goldstein & Khan, 1985; Marquez, 2006). Estimations with disaggregated trade data may uncover new evidence for the dynamic adjustment of individual trade flow to an exchange rate or income shock. In this study, we use the newly reclassified disaggregated services trade data from the US International Transactions Accounts of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The US International Transactions Accounts is restructured in June 2014 and the aggregate services trade is reclassified from five to nine major categories. The objective of restructuring the International Transactions Accounts is to bring the accounts into closer alignment with international guidelines and to provide additional details of individual services trade (Borga & Howell, 2014). The import and export models of services trade are estimated with the aggregate and nine major categories of services trade data by employing the Autoregressive Distribution Lag (ARDL) cointegration methodology with bounds testing (Pesaran, Shin, & Smith, 2001) to capture the short- and long-run dynamics of the time-path of each individual services trade to an exchange rate or income shock.====Empirical results show that the sensitivities of individual services trade to exchange rate changes are mixed. Dollar devaluation may not raise (reduce) export (import) services trade. It is interesting to note that some individual services trades are insensitive to exchange rate changes. Their responses to exchange rate changes largely rely on the intangible nature of services that requires the production and consumption of a service simultaneously (Kimura & Lee, 2006; Marquez, 2006). It is evident that the estimation with aggregate services trade data disguises more fundamental adjustments at individual services trade level. The estimates also reveal that most categories of services trade are income elastic. Economic growth is obviously an important determinant of imports and exports of services trade; however, individual services trade exhibits different degrees of response to income changes.====The following section reviews the literature on different approaches of estimating trade elasticities.

We therefore propose that to ensure the smooth functioning of the scheme, the fiscal union will first of all have to strengthen it at the national level by improving efficiency in the use of funds by governments. We show that this can be achieved by providing a framework for the transfer of the “critical success factors” in the policies implemented by the most efficient administrations. Furthermore, we show how public sector efficiency considerations can help ameliorate the problem of moral hazard associated with a centralized insurance scheme.","Due to the loss of independence in monetary policy coordination, member states of the euro area need an insurance mechanism to hedge against idiosyncratic and common shocks hauling against their economies.

As such, the need for a “central fiscal stabilization mechanism” has been advanced in both academic and policy circles. It is expected that the establishment of a fiscal union would foster risk sharing among member states through the central coordination of fiscal policy, especially through the transfer of funds across the area (Allard et al., 2013; Balassone, Momigliano, Romanelli, & Tommasino, 2014; Berger, Dell’Ariccia, & Obstfeld, 2018; Furceri & Zdzienicka, 2015). There has therefore been a focus in the literature on the design of a euro area-wide insurance mechanism, with contributions made by member states into a common pool of funds, coordinated by the fiscal union. While different approaches have been advanced for its design, the debate has however failed to take into consideration the efficiency of the public sector which has been identified by an extensive body of literature to be crucial in ensuring that the objectives for the disbursement of public funds are realized in the economy. This is the focus of our study.====The different proposals advanced for the design of a centralized fiscal stabilization mechanism can be subsumed under two broad categories: those with a “macroeconomic approach” where the central coordination and transfer of funds is tailored to respond to the cyclicality of budgetary revenue and spending items and those with a “microeconomic approach” that instead focus on public spending functions that are responsive to cyclical fluctuations in the macro economy; for example, unemployment insurance (Van Rompuy, 2012). Proponents of the ‘macroeconomic approach’ support the creation of a centrally coordinated stabilization fund to insure member states against permanent and unforeseen downturns (Furceri & Zdzienicka, 2015) and a cyclical shock insurance (Enderlein, Guttenberg, & Spiess, 2013). Those advancing a “microeconomic approach” such as Balassone et al., 2014, Dolls, Clemens, Dirk, and Andreas (2015), Beblavý, Marconi, and Maselli (2015), and Dullien (2014a, 2014b) have instead argued in favour of the establishment of an unemployment insurance scheme. More recently, Berger et al. (2018) argued in favour of both a centrally coordinated fund and a euro area wide unemployment insurance scheme.==== This study takes a “microeconomic approach” in the sense that we consider public spending functions that respond to the cycle. However, unlike previous studies, we focus broadly on the design of a euro-area social benefit scheme instead of an unemployment insurance scheme. This is done in order to incorporate other social spending items that are known to also perform the role of automatic stabilizers; that is, those known to be countercyclical in nature. Studies by Afonso and Furceri (2008), Darby and Mélitz (2008), and Furceri (2010) have shown that aside unemployment insurance, other social spending items like those on old age and sick pay also have a smoothening effect on output fluctuations. We however restrict our analysis to public sector efficiency considerations related to the design of the scheme and do not intend to quantify the degree of shocks it is able to insure member countries against. Ours is a policy related (although based on empirical findings) contribution to the debate.====First, we show that a major limitation in the line of thinking advanced by studies in the literature is that they abstract significantly from reality by assuming that countries are inherently efficient in the utilization of public funds allocated to social protection schemes during economic downturns. Our results however show large-scale inefficiencies in the utilization of funds allocated to social protection in the euro area during the great recession and euro area sovereign debt crisis that followed, with countries wasting on average 34.6% of funds disbursed to the scheme during this period. This suggests that the severity of the crisis on the economies of member states could have been attenuated if existing funds were utilized efficiently. It also follows that, contrary to the belief in the literature that member countries were adversely affected by the twin crisis primarily because of their inability to raise funds from private capital markets, inefficiency in the utilization of available funds also worked to further worsen the situation.====We therefore propose that to ensure the smooth functioning of a centralized social benefit scheme, the fiscal union will first of all have to strengthen the scheme at the national level, especially with regards improving efficiency in the use of funds allocated to it by governments. If member countries are inherently inefficient in the utilization of financial resources mobilized nationally then it will only follow that they will also be grossly inefficient in the utilization of the funds transferred from the fiscal union. Funds transferred to member states will not result in the desired effect in their economies (in this case the funding of social benefit schemes to help households smooth their consumption) if inefficiency in current spending levels is not addressed. The fiscal union is therefore saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that efficiency improves generally across the area. We argue that this will involve ensuring that countries can learn from each other; with the less efficient ones learning from the more efficient ones. And a way to achieve this is to accurately benchmark the efficiency of the public sector across member states in order to provide a framework for the transfer of the “critical success factors” in the policies implemented by the most efficient administrations. In the literature, public sector efficiency has been empirically assessed through international comparison studies such as that by Afonso, Schuknecht, and Tanzi (2005, 2010, Adam, Delis, and Kammas (2011a, 2011b and Dutu and Sicari (2016) who adopted various approaches to benchmarking the efficiency of government spending activities across countries. These studies however all failed to provide an accurate evaluation of the efficiency of the public sector because of the inherent limitations in the methodological approach adopted. In particular, a time frame is arbitrarily selected through which efficiency is compared across countries. The problem with this approach however is that it does not provide a framework for the transfer of policies across countries because efficiency is not made to relate to any particular government administration. As such, there is no context for the policies implemented by the best performers to be adopted by others because the time frame is not made to relate to any policy era (Olanubi & Osode, 2017). As noted by Radaelli (2000), the effectiveness of policy transfer is limited when there are no national case studies to be emulated. We therefore propose that comparing efficiency across specific government regimes, instead of selecting an arbitrary time frame that does not relate to any particular administration nor to the policies implemented during their tenure, will help provide a framework for the transfer of social protection policies across the area. Countries can easily learn from the experiences of the “best performers” and discover the “critical success factors” that can be adopted to fit the unique context of their economies. Moreover, this approach would also help the fiscal union in the design of a centralized social protection insurance scheme (and all of its variants such as the unemployment insurance scheme) as the policies of the most efficient administrations are adopted as case studies.====Second, we propose that benchmarking the efficiency of the public sector will help ameliorate the problem of moral hazard associated with a centralized insurance mechanism. When funds are transferred to member states on a “needs-basis” (that is, when they are hit by a shock and in need to smoothen it) countries have an incentive to be inefficient in the utilization of the funds mobilized nationally since they are assured of receiving transfers from the fiscal union when hit by a shock. To prevent this, funds can be disbursed to countries based on their efficiency levels. This implies that the highly efficient countries will receive higher amounts as transfers than the least efficient countries. This will in turn serve as an incentive for countries to improve the efficiency of their spending activities.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we present a brief review of the different approaches to the measurement of public sector efficiency. In Section 3, we present the model specification adopted in this study. In Section 4 we present and discuss the results of our analysis and Section 5 concludes the study.",Public sector efficiency in the design of a euro-area social benefit scheme,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819301231,18 November 2019,2019,Research Article,256.0

At the same time, old-aged dependency and longevity occur due to rising life expectancy at birth. Our study aims to examine the effect of population ageing on private savings. A panel data of a sample of selected European countries collected from the World Bank (WB, 2016) – World Development Indicators (WDI) database is used, in order to analyze possible heterogeneity across and multiple subsamples. The span period is 1990–2013. Besides, economic growth and crisis provide empirical support. Our findings show that longevity and dependency rates have both significant impacts on savings. However, the results are influenced by the way in which the data is managed. Therefore, this calls into question the practice of applying for a reform in the government’s old-age support programs. Besides, the paper makes a good contribution to knowledge: firstly, it is innovative since it puts together demographic and economic variables among a selected group of developed countries; secondly, it uses a very up-to-dated database; and thirdly, it fills a gap in the literature.","European Union (EU) countries face different issues caused by population aging related to many aspects of economy such as economic globalization, international trade, economic growth, labor force, pension system-building, protection of rights of the elderly, capital accumulation and of course savings. Thus, demographic changes pose a policy challenge in developed countries. In the case of EU countries, the larger elderly population is driven by a rise in longevity and a fall in fertility rates. However, longer life expectancy should increase savings if middle age individuals change their behavior to increase savings in response to a higher life expectancy (Bloom, Canning, & Graham, 2003). In fact, policy makers should encourage household savings for late-life events including health care costs.====EU countries have achieved a high socio-economic level before facing an ageing population. The purpose of this paper is to point out the effect of population aging on savings. In fact, Modigliani and Brumberg (1954) in a seminal paper, showed that according to the life cycle, in children and old age, savings are negative and the increasing dependency ratio reduces national saving which has a significant impact on economic growth. In addition, human capital investment is also affected. As a consequence, population changes have an important impact on education and health spending. Other authors as Agrawal, Sahoo, and Kumar (2009) present individual country analysis of the savings behaviour in five main South Asian countries, namely India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, using modern time series procedures. Their results show savings in South Asia are mainly determined by income, access to banking institutions, foreign savings rate and dependency rate. More recently, Khan (2017) investigated the savings and investment relationship through a dynamic process concluding that the degree of capital mobility is increasing as the world financial markets are becoming increasingly integrated over time.====Our analysis is twofold. Firstly, the empirical approach relies on econometric tools to estimate the empirical relationship between savings and socio-economic variables. Also, we confirm there is a close relationship of life expectancy with social and economic conditions, physical environment and individual lifestyle. For example, if we focus on socioeconomic variables, the relationship between income (understood as a measure of socioeconomic status) and health is probably very complicated, depending on the context and the aggregation level. Even when the positive correlation is clear, causal interpretations may include income influencing health, health influencing income and/or “third variables” affecting both indicators in the same direction and at the same time. However, there are special cases. For example, some southern countries of the European Union that are relatively poor have a life expectancy indicator greater than that of the rich countries of northern Europe.====Thus, this work is related to the strand of the literature that investigates the joint effects of higher age dependency and rising longevity on savings. This paper uses a panel dataset of European selected countries over the period 1990–2013. The main contributions of this empirical study are summarized as follows. Firstly, the main control variables are consistent and significant. Secondly, longevity has a significant positive effect on savings, whereas old-aged dependency rate has a negative one. Thirdly, from an economic policy perspective the aforementioned results would condition retirement age and/or pensions decisions and policies.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the literature review of empirical literature and Section 3 describes the basic framework of the research. Section 4 presents our main empirical results. The Section 5 discusses our findings and Section 6 concludes.====Although previous empirical literature presents different ways of understanding the evidence, most analyses report that average health is worse in more unequal societies. However, this relationship is not perfect, since there are several determinants that can influence it. In addition, countries with lower per capita income levels have lower mortality rates. This issue could be explained by arguing that while it is true that some factors (food and housing) are positively associated with a level of income above a certain minimum, there may be others (alcohol, tobacco or drug consumption) that have the opposite impact.====According to data from World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2015), the number of older persons—those aged 60 years or over—has increased substantially in recent years, and between 2015 and 2030, it is projected to grow by 56%, from 901 million to 1.4 billion. It can be seen that the number of people aged 80 years or over, the “oldest-old” persons, are growing even faster than the number of older persons overall. Again, continued improvements in living standards, health styles, and medical care also helped to lower mortality rate from chronic diseases; these circumstances will result in higher life expectancy around the world (Guest, 2006; Kolasa & Rubaszek, 2016; Raftery, Alkema, & Gerland, 2014) and, through channels like fertility and mortality, in opposite effects on capital accumulation (Lau, 2014).====Recently, the European Commission has published the 2018 Ageing Report. As main results, it points out that the age structure of the EU population is going to change significantly in the coming decades. In fact, the demographic old-age dependency ratio (people aged 65 or above relative to those aged 15–64) is projected to increase significantly. In fact, population changes depend upon assumptions regarding fertility rates, life expectancy and migration. This new situation has important consequences on labor force projections, future GDP growth as well as other social factors such as longer schooling, access to early retirement or pension reforms. In this sense, challenges posed by demographic change are focused on labour market, reforms of social protection systems, health care and long-term care arrangements. Thus, the core policy directions are the following ones(): support demographic renewal, boost employment, raise productivity and economic performance by investing in education and research, receive and integrate migrants and ensure sustainable public finances to guarantee adequate pensions, health care and long-term care.====Saving behaviour is determined by factors as social, demographic and cultural ones. However, the choice of the independent variables is based on other empirical studies. In fact, the relationship between saving and income in developed countries is considered important. Thus, it is considered that for increases of household incomes, increases in saving rates are to be expected (Callen & Thiman, 1997; Kessler & Perelman, 1993; Muradoglu & Ttaskin, 1996). Thus, in order to highlight the influence of economic growth and household income, we have included in the model “per capita income growth”. Also, the model proves the role of the demographic variables on the saving rate (life expectancy at birth, the demographic dependency ratio of the elderly, etc.). The model is a cross-section one. We are interested in the analysis of a specific set of variables for “n” countries in “t” time periods. Thus, the analysis identifies a series of variables of household saving behaviour.====Finally, we could point out some possible policy implications and new challenges. Firstly, our results confirm the importance of households savings. As a consequence, raising investment, when it is possible, could help to improve imbalances between savings and investment. In the labour market, removing wage rigidities and strengthening active labour market policies could support economic growth. Obviously, fiscal policies are another point of interest because they could strength investment incentives and rebound positively in private savings.====The interaction of macro-economic and socio-physical conditions in our societies is an important issue for policy makers and few articles approach this matter and it has policy relevance which should motivate the discussion as a way of “guiding policy”.====Among geographic areas with more of a tradition of this type of applied studies, we can find Great Britain and its “Black Report” (Black, 1980), which was updated in the following years. For example, the “Achenson Report” is a continuation of previous studies, from the perspective of the wide differences in the United Kingdom between those at the low and those at the high end of the social scale (Rivera et al., 2016). These differences were registered in stages of prosperity and, at the same time, periods when there were reductions in the mortality rate across the geographic area considered at an aggregated level. Hence, in the “Achenson Report” a conceptual structure is presented that defines the determinants of health in a complex system: income, education, housing, employment, smoking, alcohol intake and lifestyles.====Based on this view, the “Achenson Report” denotes 39 recommendations, or priority policy directions, for not increasing health inequalities. This advice is based on greater income of the poorest to enhance their lifestyle and nutrition and the basic facilities to give them better health.====Among the most recent papers, there is also a key issue in solving the paradox that income appears to be related to health within economies but not between them. The best proxy relies on the fact that in developed countries, which have developed a certain standard of living, increases in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) make little difference to the levels of health. The reason for it is the called epidemiological transition (McKeown, 2009). It shows changing trends of population age distributions, mortality, fertility rates, life expectancy, and death causes. Nevertheless, within countries, differences in living standards help to create a social order in the population.====The central argument of understanding health indicators is to measure the health status of a population. This is not an easy issue. The indicators commonly used, which are available for a large number of these areas, are mortality rates (infant and adult) and life expectancy. Nevertheless, these indicators are not sensitive to improvements in quality of life, a basic issue in developed countries where high levels of health have already been registered. In spite of these disadvantages, mortality is an indicator widely employed in academic studies linking income and health, as the information are more readily available when making comparisons between countries.====Another issue of relevance in the c==== that are considered in the analysis is the relationship between income and health because it is another methodological aspect that is particularly important. Although several papers show a positive relationship between health and income, few of them are worried about the causality of this association. Thus, this causality is difficult to test (Babones, 2008). The author points out that although there is a “strong, consistent and statistically significant correlation between national income inequality and population health”, it is true that there is also evidence showing that this correlation is causal.",Does population ageing affect savings in Europe?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819301164,9 October 2019,2019,Research Article,257.0

The underwriting losses are cross-subsidized by investment income resulting in overall profits. In this paper, we investigate if the same is true in the Indian context. For this Simplex representation, (also known as trilinear plot or Saari Triangle) a tool in the field of political science, is adapted. Simplex representation can give an instant understanding of the relative performance of a company in any segment/domain. The study reveals that, contrary to expectation, it is reinsurance that has contributed more to overall aggregate performance as against investment.","In the insurance industry, companies earn their profits from three business domains, namely, underwriting, reinsurance or investments. Based on past performance, this paper analyses whether companies that have focussed on one of the segments have done better against those who concentrated equally across all three domains. To analyze which contributes more, one can adopt a time series regression analysis. But in the context of the Indian Insurance industry, the availability of this data is limited. All private sector companies are less than 20 years old as compared to the public sector companies that are over 70 years old. Regressions would not suit this work since data points are few and would skew the results. Had ratio analysis been done, it would give segment wise results, since no single ratio binds all aspects. This paper borrows the concept of the Saari Triangle diagram used in Political Science to answer the relative contribution of each domain in contributing to the company's overall profit score for any year. If a company is in the center of the triangle, it has performed equally well or equally poorly in each of the business domains. If one moves away from the center to any of the corners, its relative performance in one of business becomes better than the other two. This paper investigates if it is possible to do relatively well in the aggregate if one does average in all the business domains as opposed to doing very well in one of the business domains and getting a relatively high aggregate score. This view would help in strategic decision making for industries.====This paper is organized as follows: the next section gives a brief background of previous literature and the concept of Simplex representation as well as insurance performance measures used in this paper.

A non-dynamic panel threshold model, introduced by ====, is employed. The novelty of the empirical findings from the present study is that there exists a non-linear relationship between the budget deficit and the trade balance, which is driven by a critical threshold level in the real interest rates. The findings suggest that twin deficit hypothesis holds only under the low real interest rate regime, that is, rises in budget deficits lead to deteriorations in the trade balance when the real interest rate is below the threshold level. When the high real interest rate (i.e. above-the-threshold) regime is concerned, increasing budget deficits give rise to improvements in the trade balance, a finding consistent with the twin divergence hypothesis. Thus, the effect on the trade balance of an expansionary fiscal policy that worsens the budget balance reverses substantially depending on the threshold level of the real interest rates. The major policy implication of this paper is that the policy makers in the selected ==== countries should pay a greater attention to fiscal discipline in order to prevent the trade balance from worsening, because the majority of the countries fall into the low real interest rate regime over the recent years of the sample period (i.e. between 2010 and 2016).","The association between rising trade deficits and chronic fiscal deficits has been attracting the attention of policy makers, academics, and even the laypersons since the early 1980s when the two deficits grew dramatically in the developed nations including the U.S. Since the two deficits or the “twins” soared in the U.S. between 1980 and 1986, the earliest studies scrutinize the U.S. data (Abell, 1990; Gordon, 1986; Laney, 1984; McKinnon, 1980, 1990; Miller & Russek, 1989; Summers, 1986).====Twin deficits can be linked by two theoretical approaches. First approach which considers the Mundell–Fleming framework assuming perfect capital mobility and flexible exchange rates is as follows: An increase in fiscal deficits brings about a rise in real domestic interest rates, which attracts foreign capital inflows and results in the appreciation of the domestic currency, giving rise to a deterioration in the trade balance due to increased imports and discouraged exports (Salvatore, 2006). This channel is also the case under fixed exchange rate regimes. The fiscal stimulus under fixed exchange rates generates higher real income that worsens the trade balance (Anoruo & Ramchander, 1998). The latter approach is the Keynesian absorption theory. According to this theory, an increase in the budget deficit motivates domestic absorption and thus increased imports, which in turn deteriorates the trade balance. Besides, depending on Feldstein and Horioka (1980), a strong correlation between national saving and domestic investment may support the twin deficit hypothesis (TDH henceforth). They argue that measures to increase national savings would be likely to lead to higher investment rates, and hence to economic growth. To the extent that the link from national savings to investments flows through interest rates, a greater fiscal deficit may lead to an increase in the trade deficit, to the extent that higher interest rates induce an appreciation of the domestic currency (Helliwell, 1990).====Ricardian equivalence hypothesis (REH), initially introduced by Barro (1974, 1989) postulates in contrast with the TDH that an increase in the budget deficit will lead to an instantaneous equal increase in private savings, that is, long-lived agents are farsighted enough to predict the future taxes needed to finance current fiscal deficits. For this reason, they lower their consumption and investment spending, which eliminates the link between the fiscal and trade balance.====Kim and Roubini (2008) argue that co-movement of fiscal and trade deficits is not the typical feature of the entire U.S. data. Their findings suggest that government budget deficit shocks are associated with an improvement of the trade balance and a depreciation of the real exchange rate. This divergence between budget and trade deficits (i.e. the twin divergence hypothesis) may stem from the endogenous movements of the government budget and the trade account. They also put forward that this paradoxical correlation occurs even when they control for the effects of output shocks that are likely to generate a twin divergence. That is, even the exogenous fiscal deficit shocks are associated with an improvement of the trade balance.====Though the TDH has already been widely investigated by time series or panel data analyses, the findings are inconclusive. A large number of earlier studies found evidence in favor of the TDH (see Abell, 1990; Bachman, 1992; Cavallo, 2005; Darrat, 1988; Kasa, 1994; Normandin, 1999; Piersanti, 2000; Salvatore, 2006; Summers, 1986; Zietiz & Pemberton, 1990, among others). There is also a vast body of empirical evidence supporting the REH (see Andersen, 1990; Dewald & Ulan, 1990; Enders & Lee, 1990; Kaufmann, Scharler, & Winckler, 2002; Kim, 1995; Miller & Russek, 1989, among others). Moreover, as stated above, Kim and Roubini (2008) found evidence in favor of a divergence instead of a co-movement between the two deficits.====Recent studies revive the debate on the twin deficits by laying emphasis on the inconclusiveness of the empirical findings. According to Trachanas and Katrakilidis (2013), one of the main reasons for the mixed results is that the majority of the researches to model the TDH have followed a linear framework. Bagnai (2006), Daly and Siddiki (2009), Rafiq (2010), and Holmes (2011) also note that the relationship between the twin deficits changes substantially when ==== is permitted in the procedures. More recently, Ahmad, Aworinde, and Martin (2015) proved in a threshold cointegration framework that the relationships between the twin deficits in certain African countries may be non-linear depending on a threshold level in fiscal balance.====By taking these criticisms into account, the present paper examines the TDH in a sample of OECD countries by considering that the relationship between the budget deficit and the trade balance may take a non-linear form contingent on a threshold level in the real interest rates. A panel threshold model is employed to explore the hypothesized non-linearity. To the best of our knowledge, such a panel threshold setting has never been adopted before by a previous study to investigate the validity of the TDH in the OECD countries.

Utilizing an extended version of the knowledge-capital model, which includes six types of firms and four countries grouped into market and non-market, simulation analysis reveals that efforts to enhance attractiveness of the UK as a destination market to increase horizontal-type inward foreign direct investment would be a solution to cover losses from reduction in the number of export-platforms.","During the past decades, production processes tend to be divided into several stages beyond national boundary forming multinational production networks. In this environment, the United Kingdom (UK) decided to leave the European Union (EU) based on the result of the public vote held on June 23, 2016. On March 29, 2017, the prime minister of Great Britain, Theresa May, signed Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to officially trigger the British exit from the EU (Brexit) within two years. While the negotiations between the UK and EU started in June 2017 setting a target to reach withdrawal agreement by October 2018, the UK Houses of Parliament passed the EU Withdrawal Act 2018 on June 26, 2018, in order to ensure that newly introduced EU rules no longer affect the UK law. Then, the draft agreement between the UK and EU on the text of a Brexit withdrawal deal was published on November 14, 2018, and May secured approval from her Cabinet. However, the process of Brexit turned to reach a very critical and sensitive stage. On January 15, 2019, the UK House of Commons rejected the May’s Brexit deal. Although May made every efforts to persuade Members of Parliament (MPs) by renegotiating with the EU and preparing an amended deal that includes an alternative plan on the Irish border issue, the withdrawal deal has not yet been accepted by MPs even after March 29, 2019, the initial due-date to leave the EU. Under the current circumstances, the UK has no choice but to present another plan. Otherwise, a no-deal Brexit on April 12 comes closer to reality.====Besides the political turmoil, the probable possibility of losing the position as an export-platform country, which serves as a gateway to have access to the huge EU market, is one of the potential risks of Brexit for the UK economy. The UK is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the EU, with almost half of the FDI coming from other EU countries (Global Counsel 2015; HM Government 2016; UK Trade & Investment 2016). Affiliate sales by foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) account for about 40% of total sales in the UK, which volume is larger than the other European economies (Fernández-Pacheco Theurer, López Ruiz, and Latorre 2018). At a global level, the UK is the third highest recipient of FDI after the United States (US) and China (Simionescu 2016). The purpose of this paper is to explore how Brexit could affect the production patterns of MNEs that choose the UK as a destination market or as a gateway to the EU market.====While there has been plentiful numbers of researches on the patterns of FDI, not many studies have comprehensively handled every operational strategy of MNEs in one model. In particular, export-platform has not been much discussed in the theoretical literatures, although empirical studies showed its importance. Since the UK plays a significant role for MNEs as a gateway to the EU market, the analytical model for this study must include this type (export-platform) in addition to the typical horizontal- and vertical-type MNEs. Along with the typical types of MNEs, Ekholm, Forslid, and Markusen (2007) incorporated export-platform in one consistent analytical framework. Utilizing numerical simulation technic, they examined conditions that determine strategies of MNEs, which have four types of operational option. Although their model had two market and one non-market countries, there is only one production factor, and the non-market country is treated as exogenous in a partial equilibrium framework. Ito (2013) also considered every operational type of MNE in one model. Based on the model developed by Navaretti and Venebles (2004), he included export-platform, and showed a possibility that reduction in trade costs may motivate firms to take the export-platform strategy. However, he did not consider production costs other than trade costs to derive testable hypotheses for empirical testing. To include both trade and production costs in a general equilibrium setting, Oyamada (2019) extended the knowledge-capital model, which was used in Markusen (1997) and Zhang and Markusen (1999), introducing two types of export-platform that operate in two non-market countries, and explored the effects of changes in factor prices on the operational strategies of firms. This study is an application of the analytical framework presented by the extended knowledge-capital model to the case of Brexit.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the major assumptions and basic characteristics of the extended knowledge-capital model. In Sections 3 and 4, we perform simulations and report on results that reveal which type of firms would be active under the Brexit scenario and how selected economic indicators including welfare are affected. Finally, Section 5 concludes this study.",How does BREXIT affect production patterns of multinational enterprises?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819301139,28 September 2019,2019,Research Article,260.0

We find the evidence of a strong, positive correlation between Facebook penetration (a proxy for social media) and democracy. We further show that the correlation between social media and democracy is stronger for low-income countries than high-income countries. Our lowest point estimates indicate that a one-standard deviation (about 18 percentage point) increase in Facebook penetration is associated with an improvement in the democracy index by about 8-point (on a scale of 0–100) for the world sample and over 11 points for the sample of low-income countries.","Though several recent studies have argued that the liberation technology, such as the internet, mobile phones, and social media, has the potential to positively influence democratic outcomes (Diamond, 2010; Saleh, 2012), whether or not social media promote democracy has not been empirically investigated in a cross-section of countries. The empirical evidence on the relationship between the internet and democracy also remains mixed.==== This is not surprising since the internet cannot only be used as a tool for democratization, but also as an instrument for authoritarianism (Aday et al., 2010; Morozov, 2012),==== indicating that the relationship between the internet and internet-based technologies and democracy may depend on other factors (for example, the role of civil society). Diamond (2010) has emphasized the importance of civil society, political organizations, and economic forces in determining the effect of technological progress on the strength of democracy. Moreover, since different internet-based technologies have different architectures and hence they influence different kinds of behavior (Lessig, 2009), various scholars (e.g., Farrell, 2012) have suggested that, instead of studying the internet as such, researchers should study different technologies based on the internet such as social media and their implications for democratic and political outcomes. Yet, while several studies have argued that social media has the potential to promote the accountability and hence democracy in a country; there are no studies, to the best of our knowledge, that empirically report such a correlation. The primary objective and contribution of this study is to bridge this gap in the literature.====The relationship between social media and democracy has become even more important in the wake of the current reversal in democratic trend across the world. “Freedom in the World 2019″ report by the Freedom House, a leading non-government organization dedicated to strengthening democracies around the world, finds that global freedom has been declining in countries in every region including the United States (Freedom House, 2019). This is a worrying trend because several countries became more free (democratic) during 1988–2005 in its widely used index ====, the trend has reversed since 2005 and has continued ever since. Over the period of 2006–2018, only 63 countries’ scores measuring the freedom of their citizens have improved, while that of 116 countries have declined. At the same time, the number of social media users around the world has increased tremendously in the last decade from under 1 billion in 2010 to 2.77 billion in 2019. Even though the internet remains inaccessible to half the population in the world (Alliance for Affordable Internet, 2018), social activists have utilized the internet and social media to bypass authorities to reach the masses in their bid to promote democracies in several countries. The governments in many countries have responded to that by targeting these social activists using vague laws and restricting the contents that can be accessed and share on the net (Freedom House, 2015). But social media has made it possible to get such news out in the world forcing the governments in many countries to retreat because of international censure and pressure. Consequently, the issue of unrestricted access to independent news sources and the freedom to share such contents on social media without the fear of retaliation from the governments have become some of the important concerns in many parts of world. Additionally, this issue has become an unavoidable source of policy dilemma for the governments in many countries because while allowing the content to be shared results in the expansion of democratic power of the citizens, reducing their political oligarchy; information censorship by restricting the use of the internet and/or controlling the content that can be shared on social media platforms draws censure from the international community. The above discussion gives rise to an important question: Can social media promote democracy or is it subject to same kinds of censorship as traditional media such as print media and television?====The intention of this paper is to draw the attention of researchers to this important issue of investigating the causal relationship between social media and democracy and identifying the causal mechanisms through which the internet and internet-based technologies can affect democracy. Towards this end, the contribution of this study is two-fold that also convey its objectives. First and foremost, the study is the first one to empirically examine the relationship between social media and democracy in a cross-section of over 125 countries. Further, the existing literature suggests that while the internet and internet-based technologies such as social media have the potential to strengthen democracy, their effects may not be homogeneous across different parts of the world (Best & Wade, 2009; Corrales, 2002).==== It is quite possible that social media may affect democracy in high-income countries differently from low-income countries.==== This possibility arises since low-income countries are often characterized by weaker democracies and, therefore, social media has the potential to play a much bigger role in empowering the citizens of such countries. Hence, we also hypothesize and investigate whether the relationship between social media and democracy is stronger for low-income countries than high-income countries.====Studies have argued that there are multiple ways in which social media and the internet, which are forms of new information and communication technologies (ICTs), may strengthen democracy. First, the internet positively influences the capability of citizens to communicate information with the governments (Margetts, 2013), which is likely to have a favorable impact on democracy in countries with defective, formally democratic countries. Second, the internet and social media provide means of multi-way communication, which is harder to control than one-way communication that is allowed by traditional platforms such as newspaper, radios, and televisions.==== ICTs, including the internet and social media, promote transparency and accountability by enabling citizens to report and expose wrongdoings and thereby potentially reduce the frequency of human rights violations because they are more likely to be discovered (Diamond, 2010). Further, social media can be utilized by civil society to reach a larger audience to mobilize protests against any attempts by the government that may potentially weaken the democratic freedom of the citizens. In support of this argument, Howard et al. (2011) find that, during “the Arab Spring” in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt at first, and then in Algeria and Sudan, digital media facilitated the individualized, localized, and community-specific dissent to turn into structured movements.==== Finally, it is also argued that individuals are likely to act more strongly in response to stories shared by their family and friends on social media because of the personal touch than stories that appear in traditional media where the victim is a stranger (Jha & Sarangi, 2017). Based on these arguments, this paper investigates whether there is a significant association between social media and democracy across countries.====We find that there is a strong, positive correlation between social media usage and democracy: Countries with greater Facebook penetration (a proxy for social media) have stronger democracy. Furthermore, we show that the effect of social media on democracy is greater for low-income countries than high-income countries. These results are robust to the inclusion of a number of control variables, alternative empirical strategies, and to an instrumental variable (IV) analysis that addresses endogeneity concerns. Moreover, the effect of social media on democracy is economically sizable: Even with our lowest point estimates, a one-standard deviation (about 18 percentage point) increase in Facebook penetration is associated with an 8-point (on a scale of 0–100) improvement in the democracy score for the world sample and over 11-point improvement for the sample of low-income countries. Finally, we also find that when social media is controlled for, the coefficient of internet penetration is not statistically significant suggesting that the impact of the internet on democracy is due to the fact that it allows the use of social media.====In what follows, we first briefly discuss the existing literature on the internet, social media, and democracy to help make the need for and the contribution of this research clearer. In Section 3, we describe our data sources, specify our empirical strategy, and discuss our instrument.

The program, which has inspired the 2015 national reform within the Jobs Act and lines towards the recent experience of several Anglo-Saxon countries, has revitalized the sector by providing important job opportunities to jobless workers. We find the typical problems of quasi-markets (lion’s share of private organizations; cherry picking; gaming and asymmetric information). However, different expedients were devised in the program to minimize these shortcomings. The empirical analysis suggest that such phenomena are at a physiological level. Analysis of the determinants of completing successfully the program provides non-trivial results as to, among others, the role of organizations of different ownership type and of the type of services provided. On these we base our policy advice.","The aim of this essay is to assess the effectiveness of the DUL (====), a program implemented in Lombardy region, under the aegis of the European Social Fund, to introduce a quasi-market organization of employment services. The program was devised to overcome the difficulties of staffed employment services in a local labor market which is one of the most dynamic in the country.====A number of previous interventions unsuccessfully aimed to increase the effectiveness of employment services nationwide. First, it was the end of state monopoly by the Treu Law of 1997. The Biagi Law of 2003 stated the full equality of rights of private (forprofit and non profit) and public employment services (PES). Despite a certain tendency of the local population in favour of private agencies, still only a small number of NEETs (Not in Employment Education or Training) were using placement services and training supplied in the system before the reform.====The intuition of the DUL to stimulate the use of employment services by the possible customers was to assign vouchers (the ==== is a voucher) of different amount to jobless workers according to their actual need, as assessed by a profiling based on objective criteria: duration of the unemployment spell, education level, age, gender. The voucher is a tool for users to choose the best services available on the market. In addition to vouchers, accredited organizations may claim a special reward for every DUL completed “successfully”, namely that leads to employment for at least six months.====The analysis is essentially descriptive, due to data limitations, and aims to study for the first time by means of administrative data some characteristics of the program as well as the determinants of success in completing successfully the program.==== We provide important insights as to the effectiveness of the program in reaching its aims and at the same time in removing some of the most important shortcomings that economic theory has brought to the fore on quasi-markets (Le Grand, 1991). In fact, different tools were devised in the programme to address the typical shortcomings of quasi-markets.====With the end of the traditional Keynesian approach to economic policy, the goal of full employment has been gradually replaced by that of employability (Centeno & Stewart, 2013). Expansionary fiscal and monetary policy have been slowly replaced not only by passive income support schemes, but, even more so, by active guidance, vocational training and self-employment policies. From a principally macroeconomic perspective to a microeconomic one.====At the center of these policies there is not only vocational training, but also the education system: the final goal of employability can be achieved when an efficient system of education and vocational training is created (VET system); hence the ensuing need to improve public education (in particular, high technical and vocational education), but also training and, importantly, from the point of view of this study, employment services.====Recently, university education has become a key factor of success in the school to work transition. Nonetheless, education attainment itself, which is in Italy one of the OECD lowest, is not everything. In fact, in countries where education follows a sequential, rather than a dual principle,==== the mission of the education system is simply general education, leaving to post-school and post-university steps the task of promoting general and job specific work experience, without which human capital is incomplete and employability is compromised. In dual education systems (e.g. Germany), classroom education and vocational on-the-job training happen at the same time: in this case, the education system’s mission is forming all-round human capital (Pastore, 2015a, 2019).====In sequential systems, the task of generating work-related competences is left to the labor market or the VET system (depending, among others, on the efficiency of Job centres). In Italy, sequential education – characterized by a low integration with enterprises also for high technical and vocational schools – is accompanied by a labor market that is slowly becoming flexible and by an unsatisfactory VET system. Within this context, efficient employment services are a key issue. Instead, only about 3.5% of new hires happen through public and private employment services, which compares to about 7% of the UK and 13.5% of Germany (Giubileo, 2012; Pastore, 2013).====In addition, at least from the 2001 reform of Title V of the Constitution, which attributed the jurisdiction for the supply of post-school vocational training to Regional authorities, there has been a “balkanization” of employment services. Some Regions (e.g.: Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna) showed a better organizational and innovation capacity than others (especially the Southern Regions) (Giubileo, Leonardi, & Pastore, 2013). Besides, traditionally, Northern regions are able to supply more jobs than Southern regions (Mauro, 2004).====Our conclusion from the policy point of view will be to show that the DUL policy is an important step forward to address many of the shortcomings of the Italian system of employment services, although at some cost, such as an increased amount of public spending of the overall service and the lion’s share of the private sector. Nonetheless, several corrections could be devised to further control these shortcomings.====This essay is structured as follows. Section 1 discusses the aims of an evaluation of a program like DUL, with all its shortcomings and merits. Section 2 describes the way of working of the program. Section 3 proposes a descriptive analysis of several aspects of the program. Section 4 focuses in part one on the methodology adopted for the econometric analysis of the determinants of the probability to successfully complete the program.

However, the impacts of debt and deficit on economic growth via the financial sector have not been thoroughly explored. Thus, this study examines the effects of debt and deficit on finance–growth nexus in West African region. It employs empirical strategies that account for various economic and ==== issues. Evidence from the study reveals that the impact of financial development on growth varies with the levels of debt and deficit. Specifically, the marginal effects of financial development on growth turn negative when debt and deficit exceed the threshold levels of 48.6% and −13.5% of GDP, respectively. The implication of this study is that the financial sector is one of the channels through which debt and deficit exert their influences on economic growth. Thus, an increase in financial development would not produce the desirable long-run economic benefits unless it is accompanied by a reduction in government debt and fiscal deficit. Based on the findings, the study makes some policy recommendations.","Growth theories posit that financial development influences economic growth in two distinct but complementary channels namely the capital accumulation channel and the total factor productivity channel. The former focuses on the ability of the financial system to mobilize savings for productive investments purposes resulting in increased capital accumulation and greater output growth. As the financial sector mobilizes savings, it overcomes the indivisibilities problems, and the resources mobilized are channelled to fund investment projects which accelerate capital accumulation. The second channel stressed the importance of innovative financial technologies that decrease the problem of information asymmetry which serves as hindrances to efficiency in the allocation of financial resources as well as investment project monitoring (King & Levine, 1993). Empirically, studies on finance–growth nexus opined that financial development has the capacity to accelerate economic growth, albeit the impact might differ between developed and developing countries (Demetriades & Law, 2006; Gould, Melecky, & Panterov, 2016; Rioja & Valev, 2004a).====Therefore, a proper understanding of the finance–growth nexus has a vital policy implication in the development agenda of several developed and developing countries. For instance, financial development may accelerate economic growth in some countries, but may not in other countries. Hence, knowing where finance spurs growth and where it does not, is important for policy formulations. While most developing countries are embarking on several policies and programs that can enhance their financial sectors (in order to promote growth), most advanced countries are characterized by developed financial systems. Some recent studies (e.g. Aizenman, Jinjarak, & Park, 2015; Arcand, Berkes, & Panizza, 2015; Law & Singh, 2014) argued that the positive impact of financial development on economic growth vanishes or turns negative after financial development reaches a certain threshold level because of “too much finance”. Hence, policy makers should understand that undeveloped financial system may not have the capacity to accelerate economic growth, while excessive financial deepening or excessive growth of credit is also repugnant to economic growth (Rousseau & Wachtel, 2011).====Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the impact of financial development on economic growth depends on the level of financial development (Aizenman et al., 2015; Law & Singh, 2014; Rioja & Valev, 2004b; Samargandi, Fidrmuc, & Ghosh, 2015), pace and structure of the financial system (Durusu-Ciftci, Ispir, & Yetkiner, 2017; Ehigiamusoe & Lean, 2017; Jedidia, Boujelbène, & Helali, 2014), level of economic development (Deidda & Fattouh, 2002; Huang & Lin, 2009), institutional quality (Law, Azman-Saini, & Ibrahim, 2013; Law, Kutan, & Naseem, 2018) and inflation rates (Ehigiamusoe, Lean, & Lee, 2019; Huang, Lin, Kim, & Yeh, 2010; Rousseau & Wachtel, 2002). This suggests that the development of the financial system is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition for finance to accelerate economic growth. Therefore, countries that want to derive the long-run economic benefits of financial development should create the appropriate environment for finance to spur growth. Hence, it is essential for policy makers to give attention to the promotion of institutional quality as well as the reduction and stabilization of inflation rates. But in recent decades, the achievement of macroeconomic stability has been a serious challenge in many developing countries because of a combination of high rates of inflation, growing fiscal deficits, large foreign debts and chronic balance of payments problems (Todaro & Smith, 2009). While the moderating effects of some macroeconomic variables (e.g. inflation rate) on the finance–growth nexus have been examined in previous studies, the influences of other macroeconomic variables (e.g. government debt and fiscal deficit) on the finance–growth nexus have not been explored.====Theoretical and empirical literature posit that government debt has negative impact on economic growth especially when debt reaches a certain threshold level (Baum, Checherita-Westphal, & Rother, 2013; Checherita-Westphal & Rother, 2012; Eberhardt & Presbitero, 2015; Gomez-Puiga & Sosvilla-Riverob, 2015; Mitze & Matz, 2015; Panizza & Presbitero, 2014, Reinhart & Rogoff, 2010; Siddique, Selvanathan, & Selvanathan, 2016; Woo & Kumar, 2015). Previous studies also highlighted the channels through which government debt adversely affects economic growth to include private investment, private saving, capital accumulation and total factor productivity. But whether government debt exerts its influence on economic growth through the financial sector have not been subjected to empirical investigation. This has important policy implications. For instance, if financial development has positive impact on economic growth, and government debt favourably influences the positive impact, policy makers will be encouraged to increase both financial development and government debt to accelerate economic growth. This is because government debt can stimulate aggregate demand and output. Conversely, if financial development has positive impact on economic growth, and government debt adversely influences the positive impact, it will be advisable for policy makers to reduce government debt in order to derive the long-run economic benefits of financial development. This is because government debt probably weakens the channels through which financial development accelerates economic growth (e.g. labour productivity growth and capital accumulation).====To capture the total impact of financial development on economic growth at various levels of government debt, it is necessary to compute the marginal effects. If the marginal effect of financial development on economic growth increases as government debt increases, policy makers will be advised to increase both financial development and government debt in order to accelerate economic growth. Conversely, if the marginal effect declines as government debt increases, it will be advisable for policy makers to reduce government debt with a view to optimizing the long-run economic benefits of financial development.====As for fiscal deficit, Fischer (1993) reported that fiscal deficit has a negative impact on economic growth, and this view was corroborated by Adam and Bevan (2005) who found a threshold level of fiscal deficit at 1.5% of GDP beyond which the impact of fiscal deficit on economic growth turns negative. Some empirical studies have also reported the detrimental effect of fiscal deficit on economic growth (e.g. Adam & Bevan, 2005; Coccia, 2017; Goulas & Zervoyianni, 2013; Miller & Russek, 1997; Woo & Kumar, 2015), though Garrison and Lee (1995) posited that budget deficit may not lead to lower growth rate of per capita output. Baharumshah, Soon, and Lau (2017) opined that the government should reduce deficit if it surpasses a certain level in order to guarantee its long-run sustainability. However, Feldstein (2016) noted that a reduction in the future deﬁcit could necessitate a cut in spending or an increase in taxes or both, which can slow the growth of the middle class social security programs. The identified channels through which fiscal deficit negatively influence economic growth include reduction in public saving, productivity growth and capital accumulation.====Besides the direct impact, fiscal deficit could also have indirect impact on economic growth via the financial sector. We investigate this indirect impact by computing the marginal effect of financial development on economic growth at various levels of fiscal deficit. In other words, we provide invaluable insights into the moderating role of fiscal deficit on the finance–growth nexus because of its policy implications. If fiscal deficit favourably moderates the finance–growth nexus, it will be necessary for policy makers to increase both financial development and fiscal deficit to enhancing economic growth. But if fiscal deficit adversely moderates the finance–growth nexus, policy makers may have to reduce fiscal deficit so that financial development can stimulate economic growth. The marginal effect of financial development on economic growth will indicate the influence of finance on growth as fiscal deficit increases or decreases, which is vital for policy formulations.====West African region was chosen for this study because the level of government debt and fiscal deficit remain high in the region. For instance, the average government debt relative to GDP in the region was 111.63% for the 1990–2014 period, and it remains high in many countries including Gambia, Ghana, Mauritania, Senegal, and Togo. Analogously, the average fiscal deficit of the region was −3.13% during the period, and there had not been any substantial improvement as the fiscal deficit of 4.12% in 2014 is still higher than −4.07% of 1990. On a country basis, fiscal deficit is high in Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea and Togo. These high levels of debt and deficit could have impact on economic growth via several channels. Thus, this study seeks to test the hypotheses that financial development has larger impact on economic growth in environment of lower government debt==== and fiscal deficit.====Therefore, the objectives of this study include; (i) to examine the effect of government debt on the finance–growth nexus in West African region (ii) to determine how fiscal deficit influences the finance–growth nexus in West African region. In this regard, this paper makes two crucial contributions to the extant literature. Firstly, it integrates the finance–growth nexus and the debt–growth nexus in order to ascertain whether government debt exerts its influence on economic growth via the financial sector. Secondly, it also incorporates the finance–growth nexus and the deficit-growth nexus in order to determine whether fiscal deficit influences the impact of finance on growth in West African region.====The remaining part of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the empirical literature while Section 3 contains the data and methodology.

In this situation, the debt consolidation calls for fiscal surplus based on increases in ==== and/or reductions in public spending. This paper aims at answering to the above question. Specifically, it evaluates different policy options on the table using the estimated model of the Italian dynamic General Equilibrium Model (IGEM). Our main message is that plans aimed at reducing the public debt based on tax increases rather than expenditure reductions are more effective. Therefore, consolidation should be designed on the former.","Excessive debts have been accumulated in several European countries starting in 2010. The emerging fiscal imbalances then reopened the hash policy debate on “austerity policies,” i.e., fiscal measures aimed at aggressively reducing budget deficits. Responsible government should commit to a primary balance constraint, increasing primary surpluses in response to rising debt service to stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio at a reasonable level.====A policy issue that has been recently highlighted is the one concerning the different costs in recessionary terms of austerity measures based on revenue increases or on reductions of the government expenditure.==== This paper aims to contribute to the policy debate by distinguishing austerity plans relying less on tax increases than on spending cuts (expenditure-based plans) from those relying more on tax increases than on spending cuts (tax-based plans).====By estimating a linear stochastic version of the Italian dynamic General Equilibrium Model (IGEM),==== we explore the different effects of austerity measures based on revenue increases or on spending cuts. We build a policy experiment where we compare two benchmark multi-year fiscal consolidation programs, which are labelled as “expenditure-based” and “tax-based” consolidations. The former (latter) implies that 70% (30%) of the adjustment is made via increasing revenues, while 30% (70%) is made by government-spending cuts.==== Both plans are credible and last two years.====Our main result is that the tax-based austerity policy is much less costly than expenditure-based austerity and that the expenditure-based adjustments could become self-defeating when the zero-lower-bound constraint is binding. The rationale of the result is that government-spending multipliers are much higher than those associated to taxes.====There is a considerable amount of literature related to our paper.==== Austerity policies are attracting widespread interest since the introduction of the hypothesis of expansionary fiscal contractions developed by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990).==== According to this theory, consolidation policies can sometimes be expansionary, even in the short run. However, the result only holds for expenditure-based adjustments when accompanied by an appropriate set of related policies. Expenditure-based approaches are much less costly in terms of output losses than tax-based plans.====The above hypothesis has been implicitly and explicitly criticized from several points of view. Early empirical studies do not convincingly address the endogeneity problem stemming from the two-way interaction between fiscal policy and output growth and do not account for the multi-year nature of austerity policies, which cannot be ignored to the extent that expectations matter. Finally, Giavazzi and Pagano’s (1996) findings imply negative (or very small) fiscal multipliers in contrast with the theoretical and empirical evidence. Therefore, although it received a large interest in current macroeconomic research, it missed a widespread scientific consensus (Anderson, Hunt, & Snudden, 2014; Guajardo, Leigh, & Pescatori, 2014; Ramey, 2011; Romer & Romer, 2010).====Sovereign debt crises faced by several European countries have revitalized the policy debate on austerity. Recently, some researches have revisited the above hypothesis (Alesina, Azzalini, Favero, Giavazzi, & Miano, 2018a; Alesina, Favero, & Giavazzi, 2018b, 2019a, 2019b; Favero & Mei, 2019). These adopt the narrative method proposed by Romer and Romer (2010) to address the endogeneity problem==== and compare multi-year announced consolidation plans.==== The main finding from this literature is that fiscal adjustments based upon cuts in government spending are much less costly, in terms of output losses, than those based upon revenue increases. The results hold for several countries including Italy (see, e.g., Favero & Mei, 2019).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

My analysis shows that choice-based eco-labels can be a welfare-improving policy. However, these welfare gains occur through “green” ==== as opposed to (social benefiting) emission reductions while emission ","The use of environmental policies has expanded significantly in recent years. Application of traditional emission regulations has continued to expand into more industries, while the variety or type of environmental policy tools available has also expanded. As noted by Tews, Busch, and Jorgens (2003), environmental regulation has shifted to flexible or market-oriented policies such as: voluntary agreements, eco-labels, and ecological tax reforms. In this paper, we further separated these types of policy into two types, market-based and choice-based policy. Market-based policy changes the underlying structure of a market by imposing additional costs based on a firms’ production methods, but it allows firms the flexibility to independently address any change (e.g. emission taxes or permits). Choice-based policy allow firms that meet a specific qualification to opt-into a program which signals the firms’ qualification to interested consumers (e.g. certifications, eco-labeling). The incentives created by market-based and choice-based policy make them an attractive alternative and environmental policy has increasingly switched from command-and-control environmental policy to these market-based and choice-based approaches.====For policymakers, emission taxes and permits offer firms flexibility in the management of their emissions, but force firms to pay for their emissions. However, these market-based policies incentivize the use of clean technology and better production methods. From a policy standpoint, taxes allow policy makers to set a specific price for emissions. While emission permits, on the other hand, allow policy makers to set the quantity of emission. Both these approaches incentivize investment in clean technology, reducing the firms’ emission costs. Previous research shows the implementations from using emission taxes and permits within a competitive market. For example, Requate (1998) demonstrations that permits, and taxation have no obvious advantage over one another, and that the optimal policy choice depends on specific parameters and the likelihood of new technology being introduced. However, the implementation of either an emission tax or emission permits faces additional challenges due to the political influence required to enact them.====More recent work has compared market-base and choice-based policies. One alternative choice-based approach is voluntary environmental programs (VEP) which aims to have industries proactively induce environmental change (Koehler, 2007). From a two-policy perspective, emission taxation is more effective than a VEP approach both in terms of increasing environmental quality and increasing social welfare (David & Sinclair-Desgagne, 2005). VEPs do not provide firms a direct signal of their abatement or environmental efforts to consumers. Generally, participation in VEPs requires a credible threat of future regulation.====A new environmental tool, which has recently received more attention, is green certification or “eco-labeling.” Eco-labeling requires firms to limit their emissions in order to meet a pre-determined standard. By meeting the standard, firms can use an eco-label to differentiate their product and obtain a premium. The flexibility of eco-labeling for producers is that firm participation in the program is completely voluntary. Another benefit is that environmentally concerned consumers receive information from eco-labels about the production methods used by a firm, which would otherwise be unobservable. Thus, by choosing voluntarily to purchase eco-labeled products (and pay a premium), consumers can reward firms’ “green” production.==== As discussed by van’t Veld and Kotchen (2011), the certifying sponsor is not limited to governments, and include groups from industry, consumer advocacy, and environmental promotion/protection.====Much of the new environmental literature focuses on the use of green certification as an option for producers to entice green consumers to purchase their product. As such, the number of certifications and “green clubs” has expanded in recent years, demonstrating consumers’ desire and willingness to pay for responsibly produced green products. Recent work has focused on understanding the impacts eco-labels have on markets. Hamilton and Zilberman (2006) shows that eco-certification can increase firm profits when consumers are willing to pay premiums for unobservable environmental attributes. Work by van’t Veld and Kotchen (2011) examines green clubs, as well as the use of imperfect monitoring by certifying organizations. Schumacher (2010) examines the use of eco-labeling both with and without the use of an emission tax in the context of consumer preferences. Their research shows that eco-labeling is welfare improving in that it increases consumer demand for “clean” goods, while decreasing demand for “dirty” goods. However, as mentioned by Larson (2003) there is little analysis of green certifications as a policy tool. As shown by Kaplow (2008), heterogeneous preferences can have important policy implications and imposing additional environmental policies in markets with eco-labeling can be welfare improving (Walter & Chang, 2017). The benefits of eco-labels also lead to an important environmental policy question: are eco-labels an effective alternative to market-based policies?====Eco-labeling allows a firm to signal their greener production to consumers, which changes environmentally conscience consumers’ willingness-to-pay for these (eco-labeled) products.==== As a result, firms can charge a premium for their product. Emission taxes and permits may reduce emissions, but traditional economic theory assumes that consumers don’t change their demand for a product once these regulatory tools are enacted. Instead, these policies create additional burdens (for consumers and/or producers) and reduce the number of market transactions even though these policies reduce environmental damages.====In this paper, I examine the viability of green certification as an effective environmental policy and determine the best environmental policy in markets, when certified green products increase consumers’ utility heterogeneously. My analysis begins by developing the analytical framework to represent firm decisions under a variety of programs and policies. As a baseline, I provide a simple evaluation of a competitive market with a negative externality caused by production emissions. Next, I examine different environmental policies and incorporate the factors that contribute to each policies effectiveness. Ideally, I wish to identify conditions where certification of green products yields a welfare improvement over alternative regulatory approaches such as emission taxes or permits. Finally, I empirically examine the effectiveness of previously deployed environmental policies and compare it to my analytical findings.====My analysis also incorporates important properties about firm emissions in relation to different policies. As first discussed by Porter and van de Linde (1995), “emissions are a sign of inefficiency,” implying that firms with greater efficiency, and therefore lower emissions, have lower costs and potentially higher profits. These costs can happen for a variety of reasons: greater efficiency means greater utilization of resources which decreases input costs (Porter & van de Linde, 1995). Lower emissions or pollution means lower liability costs from the remaining pollution (Ambec & Lanoie, 2008), and lower emissions decrease disposal costs (Bragdon and Marlin, 1972). Several studies have shown this relationship empirically. Analysis of the paper industry by Bragdon and Marlin (1972), shows the compatibility of “pollution control and profitability,” and conclude that lower pollution is associated with higher profits. Work by King and Lenox (2001) shows that pollution reduction by manufacturing firms is associated with financial gain.==== Analysis by Ambec and Lanoie (2008) provides a systematic overview which identifies circumstances where environmental performance leads to financial performance.==== Previous research illustrates an important property about emissions: a firm’s profitability is negatively related to their emissions. For many industries cleaner production requires newer equipment but decreases the quantity of inputs required for production. I incorporate this feature into my analysis, so firms that are environmentally sensitive have lower variable costs and therefore higher producer surplus.====This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, my analytical framework incorporates producer efficiency in relation to environmental cleanliness, which better illustrates the effectiveness and participation associated with eco-labeling. Second, my evaluation of choice-based eco-labels and market-based environmental policies (emission taxes and emission permits) shows that eco-labeling increases welfare by capturing additional consumer surplus from environmentally conscious consumers. However, taxation effectively reduces emissions prevalent at inefficient firms. Finally, my analysis of implemented environmental policy provides empirical support that eco-labels are inefficient relatively to emission taxation.",Comparing the effectiveness of market-based and choice-based environmental policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016189381930095X,12 August 2019,2019,Research Article,266.0

For instance, an experiment has been tried in Finland in 2017 on a sample of 2000 unemployed who received 560 euros per month. However, the Finnish government decided to stop the experiment at the end of 2018. In Italy, the government formed in 2018 is trying to introduce a so called “citizen income” which, in reality, is very far from the concept of a “universal income” since only 6.5 million residents who meet some specific conditions will receive 780 euros per month (Colombino & Islam, 2018). In France, the debate on the introduction of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been relaunched in 2016 after the proposal of the French presidential candidate Benoît Hamon and recommended by the French economist Thomas Piketty.====Given the remarkable changes in the labor market (in particular, the increase in job insecurity and job destruction) observed during the last decades as a consequence of globalization and robotization, the introduction of a Universal Basic Income can be perceived as a powerful tool in order to provide all individuals a minimum grant (Stiglitz, 2017). The UBI, which is provided to all individuals in the same amount and without conditions,==== can be interpreted as a financial compensation for the reduction in working time that contributes to a more equitable allocation of the resources in the economy.====However, the introduction of the UBI (or other similar tax systems like the negative income tax or the flat tax combined with some income support mechanism) is controversial. The introduction of the UBI has the advantage to be simple and transparent to adopt and necessitates low administrative costs. The major drawbacks of this reform, even though it would permit a significant reduction in income inequalities, is that it is very costly and could induce people to exit the labor market or to reduce the number of hours worked since the reform induce both a negative income effect, given by the transfer, and a negative substitution effect due to the higher taxes that would be needed to finance it (Colombino, 2015a). Consequently, the reform could induce an important equity-efficiency tradeoff as found in the literature (see, for instance, using a microsimulation approach, Scutella, 2004, for Australia, Horstschräer, Clauss, & Schnabel, 2010, for Germany, Clavet, Duclos, & Lacroix, 2013, for Québec, Colombino, 2015b, for Italy, and, using a CGE approach, Yunker, 2013 for the United States).==== In addition, the cost of the reform, which depends on the chosen amount that will be given to each individual, is in general very high, which would imply higher taxes and the consequent negative effect on labor supply. To avoid excessive labor supply inefficiencies, the UBI could be coupled with a flat income tax, which has been found to stimulate labor supply and reduce tax evasion in Russia (Duncan, 2014) and Western Europe (Paulus & Peichl, 2009) The main problems of these reforms are that they increase income inequalities and that the tax burden is in general shouldered by the middle class.====The aim of this article is to evaluate the effects of a revenue-neutral reform introducing a universal basic income scheme coupled with a flat income tax on the French economy. The proposed reform replaces the existing minimum income benefit, several other conditional benefits and the existing progressive income taxation. For a proper evaluation, it is thus extremely important to precisely quantify the cost of the introduction of the UBI, the fiscal reforms necessary to finance its introduction and the economic consequences, both at the individual level and at the macro level, of such shocks. This is why, in our analysis, we use an integrated Micro–Macro model==== which consists of a microsimulation model (that includes an arithmetical model for the French fiscal system and two behavioral models used to simulate the individual consumption behavior and the labor supply choices) and of a multisectoral and static CGE model. Our Micro–Macro model allowed us to evaluate the long-term macroeconomic and distributional effects of this tax reform, including its impact on: (i) macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, employment, real wages, the competitiveness of domestic firms, and the purchasing power of households, (ii) sectoral production and the allocation of production factors across sectors, (iii) individual choices concerning labor supply and consumption, and (iv) income distribution, poverty and inequality.====Our simulation results show that the overall effects of this reform would be quite positive. The reform permits not only a significant reduction in income inequality and poverty, but also a moderately positive effect at the macroeconomic level. This is explained by the fact that the elasticity of the labor supply with respect to the net real wage and with respect to other non-labor incomes are both very low in France. In other words, the tax reform induces a limited effect on labor supply which, coupled with the positive effect on the labor demand, significantly reduces unemployment. Considering that the reform produces a redistribution of income from rich people (characterized by high propensity to save) to poor people (characterized by low propensity to save), another important implication of the reform is that consumption increases at the national level, stimulating the aggregate demand. Our CGE model takes into account a non-standard macro closure which is between the standard neoclassical closure (where investments are savings-driven) and the Keynesian closure (where investments are fixed at an exogenous level). Thus, in our CGE model, the increase in aggregate demand has a positive effect on real GDP and on employment. In addition, the reduction in the unemployment rate permits an additional positive effect by reducing inequalities and poverty. Our main result is thus that the equity-efficiency tradeoff would not be produced for the proposed reform of UBI combined with a flat tax in France. This result can be achieved thanks to the relatively small amount of the benefit, which does not require an excessive increase in income tax rates, and the removal of efficiency losses implied by the progressive income taxation schedule and other non-linear conditional benefits.====This article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the main features of our Micro–Macro model. Section 3 presents the simulation results of the introduction of the UBI combined with a flat tax.

The experimental design tests the effects of the legality rating frame on consumers’ choice between products from producers labeled by the legality rating and products by unlabeled producers. Both approaches provide strong evidence of preference heterogeneity, with players who cooperate above median being less affected in their choice by monetary payoffs ==== the public good component. The empirical findings support the hypothesis of our theoretical model that (part of the) players have, in addition to the standard self-interest component, an other-regarding preference argument that is further satisfied in the legality frame plus conformity design.====A policy suggestion stemming from our experiment is based on the fact that ==== legality frames and culture have a significant effect on an important portion of consumers. These consumers reveal that the often-declared willingness to pay for socially, environmentally and legally responsible features of products is confirmed by actual purchases of more expensive responsible products. Governments should therefore promote the creation of legality rating schemes with well-defined pre-established rules such as in the Italian case.","A longstanding tradition in the experimental literature has tested indirectly the structure of individual preferences by looking at circumstances and characteristics of incentivized players’ choices. This literature has widely documented that, together with a standard self-regarding argument, (intention and/or distribution based) other-regarding components account for an important part of individual decisions. Among the most influential contributions in this respect we remember those related to (positive and negative) reciprocity (Rabin, 1993), other-regarding preferences (Cox, 2004), social welfare preferences (Charness & Rabin, 2002), betrayal aversion (Bohnet & Zeckhauser, 2004) and various forms of pure and impure (warm glow) altruism (Andreoni, 1989, Andreoni, 1990). Some studies also highlight that in the right circumstances, experimental subjects routinely behave as if they care about costs and benefits to others (Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000, Fehr and Schmidt, 1999). Moreover, subjects’ decisions to act in an other-regarding fashion seem driven primarily not by their own payoffs but by the social context/norms: by their perceptions of what others believe and how others are likely to behave. So whether or not people behave in an other-regarding fashion is determined largely by social context, tempered by considerations of personal cost and this can potentially enforce social norms making people better off (Andreoni & Bernheim, 2009; Hoffman et al., 1996).====Our paper aims to contribute originally to this literature in different respects. First, it proposes a new kind of social dilemma the “Vote-with-the-Wallet” game (VWG henceforth) as a special case of dynamic multiplayer prisoner's dilemma. The game reproduces an emerging and increasingly important situation in everyday life where consumers face the alternative between a ‘conventional’ and a (environmentally, socially, legally) ‘responsible’ product. While the first product is in general less expensive, the second claims that its purchase entails the production of a public good thereby stimulating the willingness to pay of consumers with other-regarding preferences that may/may not compensate the price differential.==== Second, we analyze choices under the above mentioned social dilemma by comparing framed and non-framed treatments where the frame refers to an Italian institutional legality rating==== (i.e., ====) potentially applicable to all countries.====The latter is a rating system enforced by the Italian Competition Authority (i.e. ====, ICA henceforth) awarding from one to three stars to companies that accept to be screened and pass legality excellence standards.==== The rating is higher when the company has a clean score in terms of tax and legal compliance and demonstrates commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). The rationale of the legality rating is to rebalance the unfair advantage that criminal firms accumulate over honest companies by operating illegally and profiting from money laundering, tax dodging, corrupt procurement, and from other fraudulent means. In so doing delinquent firms not only compete dishonestly, but also spread around the negative externality related to the deterioration of legality.====This institutional action marks virtuous firms with a legality label, and empowers as well consumers to orientate their buying toward clean enterprises. We use a framework where the experiment design is built on a social legality game, where legality -as opposed to corruption- might be considered as a public good, which encourages the achievement of maximum welfare and maximum growth rate of the economy (Shleifer & Vishny, 1993). We model the choice between products from producers labeled by the legality rating, and products by unlabeled producers as a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.====Third, we investigate the effect of the introduction of balanced budget redistribution policies taking away resources from “defectors” to reward “cooperators” in the VWG as potentially powerful schemes to increase the degree of cooperation in prisoner's dilemmas.==== Fourth, in order to discriminate between conditional cooperation and conformity we evaluate the role of different forms of information. More specifically on this point, under our standard information treatment players know about the share of previous round cooperators in their session while, under the alternative (which we call conformity treatment), they are informed about what has been done on average in the previous round of corresponding treatments in other sessions. Fifth, the collected round-by-round information on satisfaction about the game and beliefs about other players’ behaviour allows us to extract information about players’ preferences with a direct estimation of the satisfaction/utility function together with the traditional indirect approach where preferences are inferred from choices regressed on expected player and group payoffs.====The main result of the paper shows that players’ preferences are heterogeneous with consistent findings under the direct and indirect approach. Under the direct approach the choice of the less expensive product (without the public good component) produces significantly lower satisfaction in cooperators above median, satisfaction that is further reduced in treatments with the legality frame and the conformist type of information. Under the indirect approach the impact on the choice of the more expensive product of one's own differential expected payoff is significantly lower for cooperators above median and it is further decreasing in treatments with the legality frame and the conformist type of information.====The paper is divided into five sections (including introduction and conclusions). In the second section, we illustrate the theoretical model that is behind our experimental design. In the third section, we illustrate the experimental design.

Accordingly, this paper examines the effect of home country ==== conditions and Government policies on the OFDI flows from India during the period 1984 to 2015. Incorporating the structural breaks in the empirical model, results indicate the existence of a long-run relationship between OFDI flows and home country ==== and Government policies. Government policies relating to foreign trade and investment and financial sector development are found to be significant determinants. The results also suggest the need for the Government to enhance its effort on the development of knowledge infrastructure in order to support the OFDI from India's manufacturing sector and thereby contribute to the success of “Make in India” programme. Policy implications are discussed.","A salient feature of globalization over the last two decades has been the rising flow of OFDI from emerging markets of the world. As a consequence of multitude of factors including rapid growth in economic development, availability of finance, liberalized trade and investment regimes, the share of emerging markets in global OFDI flows has surged from an average of 11 per cent during the 1990s to 21 per cent during the period 2000 to 2015.==== The growth is mainly led by the emerging economies of Asia and more particularly by the BRIC countries that together accounts for more than half of the OFDI flows from emerging markets since 2000. While the Indian firms started investing abroad in late 1950s and 1960s,==== the real takeoff is, however witnessed in the decade following 2000 when India invested USD 95 billion in foreign markets as compared to USD 700 million in 1990s. The OFDI flows were recorded the highest at USD 21 billion in the year 2008, following which they recorded a slowdown owing to the global financial crisis. However, India's OFDI has been comparatively resilient with her OFDI stock recording a positive CAGR of 6 percent (2011–2015) as compared to negative CAGR of the other members of the bloc, such as Russia and Briazil.==== The investment promotion agency survey pegged India as sixth among the most promising outward direct investors in 2014–2016 (UNCTAD, 2015).====The linkage-leverage-learning (LLL) framework and the springboard perspective are posited to underlie and explain the accelerated internationalization of emerging market multinational enterprises (Luo and Tung, 2007, Mathews, 2006). The necessity and decision to undertake foreign direct investment is determined by push (home-country) as well as pull (host-country) factors. The macroeconomic environment of home country along with Government support and liberal policies towards foreign trade and investment are found to have an important bearing on the outward foreign direct investment of firms from emerging markets (e.g. Goh and Wong, 2011, Verma and Brennan, 2013). The recognition of the need for the firms to remain internationally competitive in the increasingly globalizing world has led emerging markets’ Government devise policy measures to support internationalization of their firms. For instance, “go global” policy of Chinese Government (Buckley et al., 2007), tax incentives offered by Malaysian Government (Tham, 2007), “national champions” policy by Russia Government (Andreff, 2015). In context of India, the radical transformation in the policy environment, in general came in 1991 with the adoption of new industrial policy, and with respect to the policies governing outward foreign direct investment after the introduction of foreign exchange management act (FEMA) in 2000. However, unlike other emerging markets, the empirical investigation of the OFDI flows from India from the home country perspective is limited and suffers from various shortcomings. Therefore, this study aims to find answer to an important research question – “What are the home country macroeconomic and policy related factors that drive OFDI flows from India”? In examining the policy related factors, the paper specifically takes into consideration factors relating to knowledge infrastructure of the home country to account for the strategic asset seeking FDI of Indian firms.====Using OFDI flows data from 1984 to 2015 and applying recent time series econometric techniques, the results of the study suggest that government policies relating to foreign trade and investment along with policies directed towards the development of financial market (stock market and banking sector) plays a significant role in driving OFDI from India. The result also suggests the need for the Government to accentuate its efforts in development of knowledge infrastructure to encourage OFDI from India, especially from the manufacturing sector and hence support “Make in India” programme.====The contribution of the study is two-fold: firstly, it adds to the scanty literature on outward FDI from India being examined from home country's policy perspective. Secondly, its contribution lies in the application of robust time series econometric techniques that takes into consideration the structural breaks in the underlying time-series, the neglect of which as is done in the extant studies on Indian OFDI – is likely to produce misleading results.====The following section briefly discusses policy environment relating to OFDI in India.

The paper ends with policy recommendations.","Since the 1990’s there is growing interest in the association between natural resources and economic growth, in particular in fast growing developing economies like China. Adam Smith (1776) and David Ricardo (1911) believed that countries with abundant natural resources, such as oil and gas, would develop at a faster speed (Badeeb, Lean, & Clark, 2017). However, during the 1970s and 1980s, the increase in prices of natural resources and resulting deterioration of a country’s real exchange rate and competitive advantage in global markets despite its resource abundance became known as Dutch disease. In the 1960’s the Dutch discovered they were sitting on a lot of natural gas and the sale of this gas led to a deterioration of the exchange rate, making the export of products in other sectors more expensive and imports cheaper, resulting in a decline of the manufacturing industry. The disease spread among others to the African continent (e.g. Breisinger, Diao, & Wiebelt, 2014; Eregha & Mesagan, 2016). Dutch disease has been explained by the technological progress brought about by the prosperous resource industry, the increase in capital inflows and the rise in the prices of export goods (Bandara, 1991). The relationship was further examined by, among others, Sachs and Warner (1995, 1999), who found that economies with abundant natural resources tend to grow at a slower rate compared to natural resource scarce economies. They referred to this as the resource curse (Auty, 1993; Sachs and Warner, 1995), implying that natural resources can have a negative correlation with economic growth. This can be for a variety of reasons, and of particular interest is to get more insight into the driving forces underlying this phenomenon.====The debate about the resource curse hypothesis goes back several decades and has been challenged by both economists and other scientists. For example, Brunnschweiler (2007) identifies a direct positive relationship between natural resource abundance and economic growth in a sample of roughly 100 countries and hence finds no evidence for the resource curse. Butkiewicz and Yanikkaya (2010) find evidence of the resource curse using panel data for more than 100 developed and developing countries, but do not find the same result based on cross-section data. Moreover, the resource curse only seems to exist for developing countries and not for developed countries, possibly due to more limited institutional infrastructure and human capital in the former, typically measured by the rules of law and the lagged logarithm of life expectancy, respectively (Butkiewicz & Yanikkaya, 2010). Satti, Farooq, Loganathan, and Shahbaz (2014) also find that in the long run natural resources abundance can impede economic growth in an oil abundant economy using data from 1971 to 2011. Even though an inverse relationship between natural resources and economic performance exists, economic policies can play a significant role in resource-abundant low-income countries if resource utilization is managed effectively (Auty, 2007). Making better use of the available institutional infrastructure or investing in stronger institutions may turn the resource curse in developing countries into a resource blessing (Dauvin & Guerreiro, 2017). In a global meta-analysis and review of the international literature, Shao and Yang (2014) and Havranek, Horvath, and Zeynalov (2016) conclude that no consensus exists with respect to the effect of natural resource abundance on economic growth and the transition mechanisms underlying this effect. There is furthermore no uniform approach for measuring resource abundance. While some studies use only one indicator, others use two or three (Auty, 2001). Factors that seem to have an effect on the relationship between natural resources and economic growth include investment levels, resource types and differences between how resource abundance and resource dependence are measured, either as the amount of minerals, oil and gas or the extent to which a city or province relies on the financial revenues from resource exploitation. In addition, the potential heterogeneity that can be observed in the applied research methodologies may also play a role (Kim & Lin, 2017).====This study aims to contribute to the existing empirical evidence base by carrying out a meta-analysis of studies carried out in China over the past 15 years and published in Chinese only. The results are expected to provide important insight into the relationship between resource abundance and exploitation and economic growth, and better inform policies on sustainable economic development. The Chinese literature has seen an explosion of publications in this field, which may be explained by China’s fast-growing economy. The main objective of the study is to review and examine the relationship between the availability of specific natural resources and economic growth at provincial and city level in China and assess whether or not the resource curse exists, and if it does, what causes the curse to exist. We will show that the Chinese studies examined in this study reflect the ambiguity in the international literature, where most of the reviewed studies identify and confirm the existence of the resource curse, while some are unable to find any evidence. Only a few studies in the review presented here seem to include sufficient control in the estimated models to be able to reliably explain either the presence or absence of a resource curse.====The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the research methodology used to review and synthesize the existing Chinese literature. In Section 3 we describe the main results including the resource characteristics, the characteristics of the economic control variables, the role of investments and social capital, spatial characteristics included in the estimated econometric models, and the different types of econometric models used to test the relationship between natural resource abundance and economic growth. Section 4 then discusses the existence of the resource curse phenomenon and analyzes its possible underlying causes. Section 5 concludes and addresses the main transition mechanisms behind the resource curse, followed by policy recommendations for sustainable future economic development.",Is China Affected by the Resource Curse?

When looking for a new design of the tax-benefit system that aims to enhance both efficiency and equity, the consensus emerges to lower the tax burden on labour income (Arnold et al., 2011). For European countries, in particular, two ranks of considerations support this conclusion. On efficiency grounds, the tax burden on labour income is so high that introduces sensible disincentives to labour market participation and, consequently, it is more harmful with respect to other forms of taxation (Norregaard, 2013). As far as equity is concerned, labour taxes applied in European countries seem not to pursue adequately, as currently designed, a proper redistribution of resources (Mirrlees et al., 2011). Low-earners – already seriously hit by the post-2008 crisis – often face high implicit effective marginal tax rates due to the presence of progressive income tax rates, means-tested benefits or non-refundable tax relief schemes. Such provisions entail relatively limited income support while implying very high work disincentives.====On the one hand, there are many elements in favour of shifting taxes away from labour. On the other hand, any policy maker intended to undertake this endeavour has to face with the unfavourable situation of public budgets. High debt levels and tight budget constraints imposed by European treaties, actually, prevent the introduction of any reform that is not revenue neutral, so that only reform designs able to guarantee revenue neutrality can be considered for evaluation.====Starting from these premises, in our paper we propose an ex-ante evaluation of the hypothetical introduction of more generous and refundable tax credits for low earners in Italy. Italy is a good case study as it is characterized by a high tax burden on labour income and by the absence of well-established national policies of income support comparable to those implemented in most European countries. Following the proposals advocated repeatedly by international organizations (European Commission, 2015; Immervoll, 2013; OECD, 2015), in our simulations the coverage of the costs for shifting the tax burden away from labour is financed by the revenue of the property taxation as designed and implemented in 2012 (OECD, 2015). The choice of the property tax is based on the consensus reached in the optimal tax literature, which shows that the distortions caused by taxes on immobile bases are minimized and property tax should be considered as part of a cost-efficient taxation strategy (European Commission, 2012; OECD, 2015).====The paper adds to the existing policy relevant literature by: (i) developing a methodological tool that can be applied to the analysis of revenue neutral changes to the tax-benefit systems that imply an effect on income distribution and labour market incentives; (ii) providing new empirical based evidence relevant to discuss policy implications of a tax shifting from labour to property taxes.====From a methodological perspective, the need to consider ex-ante approaches to study the effects of policy changes is well documented (Blundell, 2012). In this context, tax-benefit microsimulation models are unique tools for conducting ex-ante analysis through the simulation of counterfactual scenarios reflecting alternative policy regimes. Such counterfactuals are needed both for the “morning-after” static evaluation of tax-benefit reforms and for more complex structural models that reveal individual behavioural changes based on simulated budget constraints and an estimated model of individual choices. However, very often, the analyses rest on simplified behavioural assumptions, restrictions of the population of interest and a simplified consideration of the tax-benefit rules that limit the overall generalisation of the results.====This paper fills a methodological gap in the ex-ante policy evaluation literature providing a tool that allows policymakers and academics to include in the analysis more realistic and comprehensive elements which drive the overall effects of fiscal policy reforms.====First, this paper innovates with respect to the tax evaluation literature that focuses only on labour supply effects by adopting an equilibrium simulation procedure that accounts for the effects both on labour supply and labour demand. Creedy and Duncan (2005) and Peichl and Siegloch (2012) are first attempts to complement a discrete choice model of labour supply with a model of labour demand. The procedure adopted there, however, would not be consistent with a matching model (as the one we use in this paper) that simultaneously includes a representation of both labour supply and labour demand. Here we extend Colombino (2013), and adopt a procedure that is specifically appropriate for the estimated model and permits a consistent comparative-statics evaluation of pre- and post-reform equilibria.====Second, in our approach we try to adequately capture the specificities of the self-employed work. After the major labour market reforms started in the ‘90==== ====s, self-employment became the main entrance way in the labour market for both the women and the young (Berton, Devicenti, & Pacelli, 2011). Excluding this category (with its peculiarities) from the analysis, as often done in the assessment of policy analysis, can significantly erode the relevance of the analysis. To address this issue, we develop the analysis resorting to a multi-occupational model of household labour supply. We build on Dagsvik, Locatelli, and Strøm (2009), who include the choice among public and private employment, by allowing individuals to choose whether to work or not, hours of work and employment sector (in our case: wage employment or self-employment), thus capturing this particularly relevant dimension of the heterogeneity of the Italian labour market.====Last, the microeconometric evaluation of the policy reform takes fully into account the details of the tax-benefit system by using EUROMOD, the European wide microsimulation model (Sutherland & Figari, 2013). EUROMOD is able to simulate rigorously all the different elements of the tax-benefit system on which the proposed reform is inserted so to properly account for the many interactions between different benefits and taxes on different typologies of tax-payers and ensure fiscal neutrality. These features represent the added value of a microsimulation approach that, holding all individual characteristics constant, avoids endogeneity problems (Bourguignon & Spadaro, 2006).====The main findings of the empirical simulations provide several important contributions relevant for economic policy related to the potential consequences of shifting taxes from labour to property, which are so far little known mainly due to data and methodological limitations. The recent contribution of Bielecki and Stahler (2018) is the first attempt to measure the macro-level effects of a tax shifting from labour to property and the authors show that the use of a recurrent property tax as financing instrument minimizes the distorsive effects. We contribute to this new strand of literature by providing important insights at micro-level. The equalizing effect of the reform appears to be undisputable while the efficiency effects are more ambiguous with the average income suffering a minor decrease when equilibrium is taken into account. Imposing the equilibrium conditions on the labour market and allowing for revenue neutrality turn out to have significant effects on the simulation results, thus giving support to the methodological approach adopted in this paper.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical modeling strategy, focusing on the tax-benefit microsimulation model, the labour supply specification and the labour market equilibrium procedure adopted in the paper, followed by the estimated labour supply elasticities presented in Section 3. Section 4 illustrates the hypothetical reform which makes the current tax credits more generous and refundable while using the revenue of the property tax to ensure revenue neutrality, along with its redistributive effects. In Section 5 the labour market equilibrium effects are presented. The final Section provides a discussion of the policy implications of the study.",Shifting taxes away from labour enhances equity and fiscal efficiency,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300894,17 July 2019,2019,Research Article,272.0

Empirical findings show that aggregate FDI crowd in domestic investment, however, the effects of aggregate FDI on domestic investment in Pakistan cannot be generalized. The impact of FDI on domestic investment varies across sectors. The empirical findings in the study at sectoral level suggests that FDI in manufacturing and services sectors crowd in domestic investment while FDI in primary sector assert insignificant impact on domestic investment in Pakistan. Analyzing the reverse causal impact running from domestic investment to FDI, this study confirm that domestic investment is important in attracting FDI across the board in all the three sectors i.e. primary, manufacturing and services sectors. The positive role of FDI in manufacturing and services sectors and supportive role of indigenous investment infrastructure is of utmost importance for FDI to promote domestic investment in Pakistan.","Economic literature considers FDI as an important instrument in the process of economic development and global economic integration and suggests that FDI is a main driving force behind setting new industries (Lipsey, 2002; Shah, Hafsa, & Junjiang, 2014), providing latest technology (Sun, 1998), creating demand for local inputs (Cardoso & Dornbusch, 1989), enhance competitiveness (Kobrin, 2005) and promoting investment friendly environment in the FDI recipient economies (Kamal et al., 2019). Keeping in view the role of incoming FDI in increasing the stock of capital and filling the gap between saving and investment, ‘Neoclassical’ and ‘Endogenous’ growth theories underscore the role of FDI in promoting growth and development and suggest that FDI is an important element in the ‘race to the top’ (Bhagwati, 2007; Shah, Mohsin, & Qazi, 2016).====The positive role and widely accepted spillover effect of FDI push many of the aspirant economies to compete for FDI in the international market. They consider FDI a panacea for economic recovery and antidote for economic failings. However, it is not necessary that FDI will always favorably influence the host economy (Rodrik, 1999; Lipsey & Sjöholm, 2004). FDI can also adversely affect the economic activities in the host country (Krugman, 1998) and therefore, the positive role of FDI in the process of development should not be generalized. A number of studies including Leahy and Montagna (2000), Fry (1992), Jansen (1995), and Agosin and Mayer (2000) argue that foreign firms with better access to finance and latest technology are supposed to kick the local investors out of the market and impose huge welfare losses on them.====Keeping in view the fact that the growth-enhancing effects of inward FDI depends on the relationship between foreign and domestic investment (De Mello, 1999),==== the impact of FDI on domestic investment need deeper scrutiny to understand whether FDI promote or retard domestic investment in FDI recipient economies. The available literature divide the positive and negative impact of FDI on domestic investment into two broad terms i.e. ‘crowding in’ and ‘crowding out’. In crowding-in, FDI inflows stimulate domestic investment while in crowding-out, increase in inward FDI decreases domestic investment.====Pakistan, an ambitious country to grow rapidly, has introduced a number of policy reforms and extended preferential treatments to foreign investors in order to attract FDI and stimulate domestic investment. The liberalization of domestic economy and reforming the financial markets along with change in attitude towards FDI increased the inflows of FDI in Pakistan after 1990 (see Table A1). However, despite rapid rise in FDI inflows, domestic investment in Pakistan, the main cog in the development and a major policy objective, is still lowest in the region (Nasir & Khalid, 2004; also see Table 2). Rise in FDI and stagnant domestic investment raise serious question about the role and effectiveness of the incoming FDI in Pakistan.====Haider and Chaudhary (2012) tried to explore the puzzle of FDI inflows and domestic investment in Pakistan and concluded that FDI crowd-in domestic investment.==== However, they relied on aggregate data that could hardly reflect the true nature and impact of the incoming FDI in different sectors of Pakistan economy. Keeping in view the sectoral implication of incoming FDI and domestic investment (Shah et al., 2016), FDI analysis based on aggregate data can possibly miss the interesting interactive effects and can mask important information that can lead to erroneous conclusion. Therefore, in order to assess and revisit the expediency of FDI inflows and unmask the important information for policy formulation, in this study we explore the links between domestic investment and incoming sectoral FDI in Pakistan.====Understanding the role of sectoral FDI, namely primary, manufacturing and services in crowding-in and crowd-out domestic investment both in long aw well as in short run would be of great help mainly (a) to comprehend the sectoral implications of FDI on domestic investment in Pakistan (b) to utilize the inflows of FDI in sectors that effectively stimulate domestic investment.====Hausmann and Fernández-Arias (2000) assert that factors, including the origin and motives of FDI and the prevailing circumstances in the host economy, significantly affect the role of FDI. Despite the fact that the prevailing circumstances in the host country play an important role in the positive spillover effect of FDI (World Bank, 1998), a great deal of literature on the FDI-domestic investment nexus only scrutinize the impact of aggregate FDI on domestic investment while studies on understanding the impact of sectoral FDI on domestic investment is conspicuously missing. Similarly, the impact of domestic investment on FDI, particularly on sectoral FDI is an ignored area in the study on FDI-domestic investment nexus. Therefore, in order to fill the gap, in this study we go beyond the traditional investigation of causal relation from FDI to domestic investment and check the reverse causal impact of domestic investment on FDI inflows assuming that a high domestic investment signal lucrative opportunities and provide favorable business environment that could reduce the cost of doing business and thus can lure more FDI (Agosin & Machado, 2005; Mody & Murshid, 2005). Conducive environment and better investment infrastructure at host country also enhance the spillover impact of the incoming FDI.====Our research efforts gives a new dimension to the study of FDI-domestic investment nexus on two fronts (1) this study explore the sectoral impact of FDI, rather than aggregate, on the crowding in and crowding out of domestic investment and thus provide a new perspective to the FDI-domestic investment nexus, at least in Pakistan (2) the domestic investment feedback effect on FDI is an important but underserved area in the available literature, and therefore, in order to fill the void we investigate the role of domestic investment in attracting sectoral FDI. Our focus is to provide policy makers with deep insight to maximize the gains from FDI inflows.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a short description of FDI inflows and domestic investment in Pakistan.

Thus, public policies are needed to foster virtuous paths to reduce disparities among students with different socioeconomic background both between and within systems.","Over the last decade, the availability of detailed international surveys on cognitive achievement tests like the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of OECD, has favoured many comparative analyses of the different educational systems. PISA in particular has led to the proliferation of international rankings and comparative analysis published in newspapers, technical reports and scientific studies (on pros and cons of PISA see Hopfenbeck).====Several works aimed at investigating the performances of educational systems have benefited from these data producing a voluminous literature on the subject. More specifically, some studies have attempted to analyse the efficient use of public expenditures looking at the educational outcome (see Afonso, Schuknecht, & Tanzi, 2010; Agasisti, 2014; Annabi, 2017; Sibiano & Agasisti, 2011; Sutherland, Price, & Gonand, 2010). Other empirical works have investigated the effects of institutional variables and teaching strategies on the performance of pupils (Cordero & Gil, 2018; Herbst & Strawiński, 2016; Meroni, Vera-Toscano, & Costa, 2015) and on the differences in PISA test between different types of school (Agasisti, 2011; Agasisti & Cordero-Ferrera, 2013; Aparicio, Crespo-Cebada, Pedraja-Chaparro, & Santín, 2017; Cherchye, De Witte, Ooghe, & Nicaise, 2010; Crespo-Cebada, Pedraja-Chaparro, & Santín, 2014; Ferraro & Põder, 2018; Perelman & Santin, 2011; Schütz, West, & Wöbmann, 2007). Finally, a relevant amount of papers has been focussed on the importance of environmental factors on students’ achievement (Agasisti & Cordero, 2017; Bogetoft, Heinesen, & Tranæs, 2015; Coco & Lagravinese, 2014; De Witte & Kortelainen, 2013; López-Torres & Prior, 2015).====These latter studies, in line with the microanalysis based on different datasets (e.g. Chetty, Hendren, & Katz, 2016), clearly show that rankings of educational systems may have limited value when the socio-economic background is not considered in the analysis, as the socio-economic status heavily influences employment prospects, health outcomes, concentration in the study, access to relevant networks (e.g. internet, newspapers, libraries) that matter to students’ achievement.====In order to measure the family background at pupils’ level, the PISA survey carried out a composite measure of background characteristics: the index of Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS), which includes the employment status and the level of education of parents, as well as indicators of cultural and educational resources at home (as number of books, laptop, own room).====OECD employed this variable in order to estimate the equity of the educational systems in terms of the slope of the regression line that links the values of the ESCS index and the pupil performance. This is called “the socio-economic gradient” and suggests how much the score would increase when the ESCS index increases by one unit. The larger the increase, the more dependent the outcome to the ESCS index and, therefore, the less equitable the educational system.====Despite the extensive literature on efficiency in education, and the recognised effect of the socio-economic background on the education performances, it lacks a global perspective on equity and efficiency using the whole PISA sample and looking at ESCS as the main driver of score gap among different students.====To this regard, the aim of this work is to extend and improve the literature about equity and efficiency in education, along two lines. First, the paper investigates how the Economic Social and Cultural Status (ESCS) background affects the efficiency of educational attainments using micro-data of all countries analysed by the PISA survey. PISA test is particularly suitable for the purpose of this paper, since the survey is carried out on a representative sample of the population aged 15 years, in which the socio-economic background may still affects the outcome of the education process. This conditioning role of the ESCS, if any, should therefore be compensated when it represents inequality of opportunity (Roemer, 1998).====Second, from a methodological perspective, the paper includes the consolidated procedure to embody environmental factors into Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) – the conditional model of Ruggiero (1996) – in a non-radial version of DEA, which is the Slack Based Measure (SBM) model of Tone (2001). Using SBM, the paper assesses, for the first time, the effect of the ESCS on the overall Pareto-Koopmans efficiency at student level.====The analysis finds a significant effect of the Economic Social and Cultural Status on student performances, with a strong heterogeneity among students, and countries. Some of these trends, in particular the heterogeneity among variables, cannot be examined by using the traditional (radial) DEA. This is because the radial models can only estimate an index of overall efficiency, and they ignore what happens to the specific-variables considered. More in general, the different role of the ESCS in different aspects of education clearly reveals the importance to control for environmental factors when making decisions on the education systems.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the data; Section 3 deals with problems related to the efficiency evaluation with environmental factors and it introduces the model; Section 4 shows the results of the efficiency performances and of the inequality analysis; Section 5 discusses some policy implications; Section 6 concludes.","The impact of economic, social and cultural conditions on educational attainments",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300286,21 March 2019,2019,Research Article,276.0

The past three-and-a-half decades, however, witnessed growing income inequality (Owyang & Shell, 2016; Thompson & Leight, 2012). Some argue that inequality results from individual effort and represents a constructive factor in society. Others argue that inequality emerges from an unfair system, which lifts only a few boats at high tide and, thus, creates a disincentive to hard work (Bivens, Gould, Mishel, & Shierholz, 2014; Levy & Temin, 2011; Stiglitz, 2012).====The current trend in U.S. inequality creates a number of problems. For instance, low-income groups experience much difficulty in accessing financial and credit markets, and these market imperfections can influence the occupational outcomes of low-income individuals. The poor more likely become salary earners and the rich, entrepreneurs. Also, we observe that economic mobility has diminished in recent decades. The children of wealthy parents more likely remain wealthy, and the children of the poor, remain poor (Corak, 2016; Galor & Zeira, 1993). This reduction in mobility across the income distribution can undermine the confidence in the principles of market economies.====A most potent force driving the increase in U.S. income inequality from the 1970s through the early 2000s reflects the trend strength of the stock market (Favilukis, 2013; Hungerford, 2013). Hungerford (2013) shows that capital gains and dividends contributed to a near doubling of income inequality between 1991 and 2006. As stock and other asset prices rise, the gains disproportionately accrue to the rich, since the wealth is more unequally distributed than income. That is, the low-income group holds minuscule wealth and cannot participate in wealth accumulation in any significant way. During the 2001 and 2007 recessions and financial turmoil, top income fell significantly as stock and other asset prices experienced significant declines, but the recovery of losses did occur.====Many studies consider the possible factors which influence changes in income distribution.==== This paper considers the effect of financial development. The focus of much of financial development theory explores how financial institutions fund new investment. Theoretically and empirically, the research leads to ambiguous findings.====Theoretically, more finance makes it easier for the poor to borrow for viable projects/business, which, in turn, can reduce income inequality (Galor & Moav, 2004). Financial imperfections, such as asymmetric information and moral hazard, can hinder the poor who lack collateral and credit histories, and, therefore, relaxation of credit constraints may benefit the poor (Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, & Levine, 2007). Theory also demonstrates that finance affects income inequality (i.e., income distribution) in two ways — the extensive and intensive margins. The extensive margin affects the number of individuals using financial services, adding individuals from the lower end of the income distribution (Becker & Tomes, 1979, 1986; Greenwood & Jovanovic, 1990). Thus, the extensive margin effects reduce inequality by allowing low income households to accumulate human capital, reduce liquidity constraints, expand investment opportunities, and manage risk. The intensive margin refers to the improvements in the quality and range of financial services. The intensive margin does not broaden access to financial service but benefits those already using financial services (Demirgüç-Kunt & Levine, 2009). In other words, the benefit of intensive margin effects will likely widen the distribution of income.====Other modeling approaches support a nonlinear relationship between finance and income distribution.==== Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990) find an inverted U-shaped curve of income inequality and financial intermediary development. At early stages of financial development, only a few wealthy individuals can access financial markets. With economic growth, however, more people can join the financial system and more individuals can enjoy the benefits. Thus, income inequality increases initially. As the economy matures, however, income inequality falls.====Clarke, Xu, and Zou (2006) also suggest a non-linear relationship that more (less) developed financial systems tend to associate with less (more) income inequality. That is, a well-functioning financial system more likely reinforces low inequality, while an underdeveloped financial system reinforces high inequality. Moreover, various combinations of financial development and inequality may produce a non-linear relationship.====Empirical evidence on the relationship between financial development and income inequality gives mixed results. Rajan and Zingales (2003) argue that in weak institutional environments, established interests have privileged access to finance. Thus, financial development induced by captured direct controls likely hurts the poor. Haber (2005) maintains that primarily the well-off and politically connected benefit from improvements in the financial system. van der Weide and Milanovic (2014) discover that high levels of inequality reduce income growth of the poor and boost the income growth of the rich. de Haan and Sturm (2016, 2017) examine how financial development, financial liberalization,==== and banking crises affect within-country income inequality, using cross-country panel data from 1975 to 2005. The authors find robust results that all financial variables increase income inequality. Also, de Haan, Pleninger, and Sturm (2017) demonstrate that financial development strengthens the inequality-raising effects of financial liberalization.====On the other hand, Bulir (2001); Honohan (2004); Beck et al. (2007), and Naceur and Zhang (2016) show that financial development alleviates inequality and poverty. Dollar and Kraay (2002) report that more access to financial and credit markets helps to reduce inequality. Law, Tan, and Azman-Saini (2014) say that in the presence of strong institutions, financial development can reduce inequality, allowing the poor to invest in human and physical capital.====U.S. policy has focused more on growth than inequality, since economic growth may ease the inequality problem. Productivity growth, however, has not trickled down to the bottom of the income distribution, and income inequality has not necessarily moved with the business cycle. Furthermore, many studies suggested that too much income inequality might itself be detrimental to long-run economic growth (Alesina & Rodrik, 1994; Birdsall, Ross, & Sabot, 1995; Deininger & Squire, 1998; Easterly & Fischer, 2001; Easterly, 2007; Persson & Tabellini, 1992; Sylwester, 2000).====With the growing size of the stock market, the financial crises have challenged traditional financial sector policies and leave little doubt that financial development indeed matters for income inequality. Given this theoretical background, we conduct an empirical analysis of the role of financial development on inequality.====Inequality has increased throughout almost every U.S. state between 1970 and the present. For example, New York and Connecticut experienced substantially greater increases in inequality than other states (Dvorkin & Shell, 2015; Morrill, 2000; Partridge, Rickman, & Levernier, 1996; Partridge, Partridge, & Rickman, 1998). Our contribution lies with the usage of cross-state data of the U.S. for the first time in this line of literature dealing with financial development and inequality. We consider the effect of financial development on income inequality across all states and in states with higher and lower inequality than the cross-sectional average of inequality. Even though the U.S. states differ from each other, using cross-state panel data minimizes not only the differences in institutions and political regimes, but also problems associated with data comparability involving the measurement of inequality, and the various variables that drive inequality across countries.====Our analysis employs the fixed-effects model, given the panel data and research purposes. Nevertheless, to check the robustness of the results to the estimation technique, we also employ the dynamic fixed-effects and system-GMM models.====This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 discusses the model specification. Section 4 reports and analyses the empirical results.

The findings of the empirical analysis show that there is a co-integration relationship between innovation and R&D. The results also reveal the existence of a positive and significant effect of business, public and higher education R&D on innovation. Business R&D is the sector with the highest positive effect on innovation. The results indicate that EU should strengthen the cooperation between business, public and higher education R&D through the encouragement of partnerships between the private sector, R&D and innovation system.","Endogenous growth theories (from the late 1980s) stress the importance of human capital, R&D and innovation in economic growth process (Aghion & Howitt, 1992; Grossman & Helpman, 1991a, 1991b; Romer, 1990). They argue that rising R&D spending leads to an increase in innovation and total productivity of the economy. Most empirical studies show that countries investing more in R&D are growing faster and achieve higher levels of social welfare than those that invest less in this sector. The innovative effort itself including formal R&D remains the sine qua non of growth (OECD, 2007). Islam (2009) argues that R&D activities enhance the innovation process and also promote R&D based absorptive capacity by easing the imitation of already existed discoveries. Edquist (2011) stresses that R&D activities produce new knowledge, while the development activity launches advanced products and processes. The relationship between R&D and innovation is highly complex. Public investment in R&D plays a crucial role for a country to be more innovative. Countries with higher efficiency on spending tend to be those with higher levels of public spending in R&D and stronger knowledge base. Public policies, including regulatory, monetary and tax policy, procurements, standards, human capital of the workforce, and market access, are important factors for establishing an environment that fosters innovation (National Science Foundation, 2012). Business R&D is necessary for the development of new innovative products and services (Wei, Liu, Song, & Romilly, 2001). Building successful R&D relationships is based on knowledge sharing. It is very important for firms to engage in knowledge sharing relationships with other firms, but also with organizations from other sectors of the economy (Carayannis & Campbell, 2009; Carayannis & Rakhmatullin, 2014). Also, both endogenous growth theory and the Triple-Helix concept of University–industry–government interactions emphasize the role of Universities not only in teaching and research but also in transferring new ideas for commercial use. R&D expenditure conducted by the higher education sector increases the knowledge base of the society and creates new prospects for business research. In this context, the entrepreneurial university serves as a conduit of spillovers contributing to economic and social development through its multiple missions of teaching, research, and entrepreneurial activities (Guerrero, Cunningham, & Urbano, 2015). Furthermore, evidence shows that the level of cooperation between the public sector and businesses is positively influenced by the intensity of public R&D spending, given that efficient public R&D systems are capable of better leveraging private investment in R&D==== (Conte, 2013, chp 5; European Commission, 2014).====The promotion of investment in knowledge by rising R&D and innovation is one of the key EU priorities and is at the heart of its growth and jobs strategy (European Commission, 2010; Trajtenberg, 1990). The Lisbon Treaty (2007) focuses on an increase in R&D spending to 3% of GDP by 2020 (1% in public and 2% in private investment, respectively). In this way, it was estimated that 3.7 million jobs could be created and EU annual GDP would have been increased by about 800 billion euro. In this way, EU tried to narrow the innovation gap with the more technologically advanced countries, such as USA, South Korea, Singapore and Japan (Ramzi, 2015). But in the last decade, most EU’ Member States failed to achieve almost all official targets (Copeland & Fixler, 2012). Only three Nordic countries – namely Denmark, Finland and Sweden – exceeded the 3 per cent benchmark by the end of 2014 (Eurostat, 2017). The business sector remains the main source of financing for R&D activities in the EU, especially in northern and western European countries. Although higher education and government sector capture lower R&D shares, they have been more resilient to economic fluctuations. The share of R&D personnel and researchers in the labour force reached 1.3% of total employment in 2014. The business sector employs more than half of this workforce (Eurostat, 2017). Member-States with a relatively high GDP per capita presented the highest number of innovative enterprises. Indeed, a third of the EU’s innovative enterprises were engaged in some form of co-operation with other enterprises or institutions over the period 2012–2014. But despite the importance of innovation, some EU countries face difficulties in strengthening their presence in this field; since 2008, the number of patent applications to the European Patent Office has stabilised at about 57,000 (Eurostat, 2017). Additionally, more recently, European Universities captured about 25 out of the top 100 positions, with Germany, France and the UK being the most representative European countries. However, it is important to ascertain a considerable variation and disparity in performance across EU member-states. While, Nordic and Western European countries have consistently tended to spend more in R&D and to stay on par with their international competitors, southern European countries and the new members-states have demonstrated a high degree of economic backwardness.====The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the contribution of R&D expenditure on innovation activity in the EU countries over the period 1995–2014. Specifically, it examines whether business, public and higher education R&D expenditure==== yield different results in the innovation process and how much they differ in causing innovation. In order to do so, it applies different panel econometric methodologies for the long-run and short-run relationships. Our focus on EU countries and on the specific time frame is due to the availability of data, as well as to the importance of the period for the European countries, for a number of reasons. First of all, a common currency was introduced and circulated among the euro-area member-states. Additionally, structural reforms and functional adjustments were implemented in most EU countries, albeit at varying degrees of intensity, extent and success. Also, the international economic and financial crisis took place. Thus, there is a need for policy recommendations in the context of designing an optimal policy strategy to restore sustainable long-term growth in EU. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the main conclusions of the literature review. Section 3 discusses the methodology, presents the data and analyses the sample. Section 4 presents our econometric results. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the main findings and provides policy recommendations.",Does research and development expenditure impact innovation?

And ==== of supranational policymaking may be preferable? To answer these questions, we introduce a policy game of two interdependent countries with reciprocal negative externalities created by shocks to a socially relevant variable. Depending on national preferences over policy options and their outcomes, both countries incur welfare losses if governments pursue non-cooperative policy choices. Then we examine what kind of supranational policy regimes may be endorsed by both governments according to the ====. Two regimes are “technocratic” (they do not take national preferences into account), two are “political” (they do). One political regime that we call “union” aggregates the national preferences additively. The thrust of our analysis is that the technocratic regimes are dominated by non-cooperation, so that the single alternative is between the union and non-cooperation. Yet an important point is that the union is the Pareto-dominant regime only within a limited range of asymmetry between countries’ preferences. This result has notable implications for the debate on the reform of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) facing the challenge of further integration of member countries. Application to the EMU case is assisted by numerical simulations based on empirical parameters drawn from qualified external sources, which show that aymmetries in national attitudes towards policies that “Europe wants” may jeopardize the creation of a union in alternative to non-cooperation.","It is a well-established principle that interdependent countries may enjoy various benefits from the creation of common policy institutions. Benefits accrue first and foremost in terms of “internalisation of externalities”, provision of public goods, economies of scale (e.g. Alesina, Perotti, & Spolaore, 1995; Alesina, Angeloni, & Etro, 2005; Alesina, Tabellini, & Trebbi, 2017; Alesina & Spolaore, 1997; Spolaore, 2015). Yet countries also face costs represented by some limitations imposed on the pursuit of national preferences (in the broad sense of interests, cultural traits and national identity) concerning policy choices and their outcomes. These costs increase when preferences are heterogeneous across the countries. This may explain why creating supranational policy institutions is more praised than practised. Under what conditions do sovereign governments agree to create a common policy institution? And ==== of supranational policymaking may be preferable?====These are the questions that we wish to address in this paper. Beside their own intrinsic interest for the design of policy institutions on international scale, today these question are also central in the life of one of the most important supranational realisations existing in the world, the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), a historical ==== for many aspects. EMU members, in addition to the various forms and levels of institutions of the European Union (EU), also share a more advanced layer of supranational policymaking, namely monetary policy entrusted to the European Central Bank (ECB), combined with a set of rules that limit fiscal sovereignty.====As a result of the dramatic “Europeanisation” of the global crisis exploded in 2008, the consensus view has emerged according to which the EMU needs deep reform of its architecture aimed at fostering ====, which means enlarging the existing layer of supranational policymaking (e.g. Baldwin & Giavazzi, 2015, 2016). A direct institution-design approach has also been advocated (Campos & Sturm, 2018). These claims have been endorsed by the top European institutions.==== Granted that the direction and extent of reforms (if any) will eventually be a political decision reflecting some balance of interests and power across governments, the results of our study may provide a normative guide to reform, i.e. to shed further light on what kind of supranational policymaking architecture may possibly be endorsed by democratic governments on behalf of their citizens.====Therefore, the paper consists of a general theoretical treatment of models of supranational policymaking, and their application to the EMU assisted by numerical simulations based on empirical values of the theoretical parameters drawn from qualified external sources. The evidence we consider, and use, is far from being exhaustive and uncontroversial; it is however instrumental to providing more tangible understanding of both the theory of supranational policymaking and the debate on the EMU reform.====After discussing the relevant strands of literature in Section 2, in Section 3 we introduce a two-country policy-game in the tradition of Hamada (1976), largely employed in the international political economy as well as in the EMU literature (see e.g., respectively, the surveys by Ghosh & Ostry, 2013, and Beetsma & Giuliodori, 2010). In line with the first principles mentioned above, the focus is on interdependence, negative (non-pecuniary) externalities, and heterogeneous preferences across countries as determinants of governments’ choices.====Our model is highly stylised in order to encompass possibly different policy fields (not necessarily economic ones) and models of supranational policymaking. Each of the two countries (==== ========= ====1, 2) is characterised by a socially relevant variable and a policy instrument. The former can be hit by shocks ==== that displace it from the bliss point by the amount ====. Interdependence consists of each country’s ==== depending on the other’s. Activation of the policy instrument ==== can offset these shocks — this we call “good policy”.==== This policy may be “whatever works”; we do not discuss policies ====: we just assume that one exists with no more efficient alternative. A particular value of it (====) can yield full protection against shocks, i.e. ====(====)==== ========= ====0. Suppose for example ==== measures changes in employment, and ==== ====<==== ====0: then ==== ====>==== ====0 can counteract the fall in employment, let it be a labour market reform that increases wage flexibility as well as more public investment. If the shock is say to labour force, ==== may be some immigrant share, etc.====The key assumption is that any amount ==== also bears a collateral welfare loss according to national preferences, reflected by some “degree of policy aversion”.==== Therefore, each government seeks its own optimal trade-off between a limited use of ==== and the consequent loss ==== by minimising a standard quadratic loss function defined over ==== and ====.====After setting out the general framework, Section 3 also presents a brief discussion of possible empirical values of the key parameters – interdependence and policy aversion – to be used in subsequent simulations.====Then Section 4 establishes the welfare losses associated with independent, non-cooperative (NC) policy choices, which are characterised by less than full shock protection in both countries, and hence reciprocal negative externalities. These arise not because of interdependence ==== but because of the cost of the “good policy”. In general, Pareto improvements over the NC regime are possible by means of devices that coordinate the two governments on a larger use of ==== and smaller change ====.====Section 5 examines what kind of supranational policy regime may be endorsed by both governments according to the Pareto criterion ==== the NC regime. This criterion is particularly relevant in contexts, such as the EMU, where institutional arrangements, or their modifications, should be voted by member countries: only Pareto-improving solutions can obtain unanimity. This may help clarify the direction where EMU reforms should be, or should not be, headed to.====By supranational regime we mean a system consisting of the two countries and a supranational entity variably entitled to enact a policy assignment (====) for each country according to an objective defined in its entitlement. We compare four different models chosen among the main instances that can be found in the literature (see Section 2). Two are “technocratic” (they do not take national preferences into account, as represented in the governments’ loss functions), and two are “political” (they do). Among the latter, one that we call “union” operates with the additive loss function of the two countries. Each supranational model is accompanied by a simulation-based discussion of the EMU case.====The thrust of our analysis is twofold. First, the governments’ choice is sensitive to the model that is proposed. Second, the technocratic regimes are systematically dominated by the NC regime and the union, while the union emerges as the single alternative to the NC regime. In line with the literature recalled above, however, the union dominates the NC regime only within a limited range of asymmetry between countries’ national preferences (the degree of policy aversion).====Therefore, our analysis lends support to the view that fostering supranational policymaking by means of technocratic, “non politicised”, agencies may be unsuccessful. National preferences and their legitimate representatives cannot be muted in the policymaking process, though their being too dissonant may pose serious challenges to the design of the best supranational policy institution.====Section 6 summarises and concludes highlighting the main implications for the EMU reform.",Models of supranational policymaking and the reform of the EMU,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300687,14 June 2019,2019,Research Article,290.0

But where should resources be focused? Does the financial sector’s ability to promote growth change at different levels of economic development or even over time, especially with large crisis shocks? For instance, markets may need to reach a certain size before project risk can be satisfactorily diversified across an economy (Acemoglu & Zilibotti, 1997). Initially banks may play a greater role in promoting economic growth but as economies develop, stock or bond markets may assist more in the raising of capital and liquidity (Allen & Gale, 2000; Levine & Zervos, 1998). What roles does insurance play with its risk mitigation ability which may also support growth (Ward & Zurbruegg, 2000)?====Financial development based on financial markets is more complex than one measure e.g. Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000), Beck and Levine (2004), Fink, Haiss, and Hristoforova (2003), and Arena (2008), who provide evidence on finance-growth for a particular component of the financial sector. For a more comprehensive approach, we have opted to use four proxies to measure financial development — one each for banking, stock markets, bond markets and insurance. A country’s level of economic development can also impact the finance-growth nexus. Rioja and Valev (2004) for instance, using banking and stock markets measures, found a positive economic growth effect for both middle and high income countries, but negative results for lower income countries. In contrast, Shen and Lee (2006) reported banking as having a weak negative relationship with economic growth. This supports the negative banking results of other finance-growth studies (e.g. Cecchetti & Kharroubi, 2012; Law & Singh, 2014). These prior studies though have not considered the effects of bond markets or insurance based on the level of economic development. We therefore test if a country’s level of economic development impact on its finance sector-growth relationship.====Using a system GMM estimator on a sample of 90 countries from 1980 to 2011, financial development (proxied by banking, stock market, bond markets and insurance) is regressed against economic growth. These relationships are then retested from 1980 to 2006 which excludes the global crisis period given that a financial crisis may also impact the ability of financial markets to promote growth (Rousseau & Wachtel, 2009). We categorise a country’s economic development into three income groups based on its initial GDP per capita. For robustness tests though, we categorise countries into two samples, following Arena (2008) using the World Bank classifications of low/middle income versus high income countries and retest our models.====We find that the overall level of economic development impacts on a country’s finance-growth relationship. The banking sector results suggest a negative impact on economic growth with high income countries reporting the lowest result. Surprisingly, the stock markets had a positive effect only for middle income countries. Bond markets had a positive effect on growth for middle and high income countries but negative for low income countries. Finally the level of insurance per capita, was positive at all levels of development supporting the Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1997) claims of risk diversification benefits provided by insurance.====Our pre-crisis sample showed similar results, with banking still negative on growth. But for the stock market though, high income countries had positive growth effects. Bond markets had negative effects pre-crisis for both low and middle income countries with the later result not found in the full sample.==== Insurance retained its positive effect pre-crisis but its full sample results were stronger perhaps suggesting added benefits from the insurance sector over the global crisis and aftermath period.====This paper makes several academic contributions. Our four sector financial development proxy adds to the literature by introducing a more comprehensive measure and consideration of low, middle and high income country effects. We extend Rioja and Valev (2004) by documenting not only that economic development matters with a more updated sample but also that its growth relation differed across our four financial components. Also the different results for our two sample periods that either included or excluded the global financial crisis, confirms that the crisis impacted particularly stock and bond markets for high income economies. Finally, we have a more extensive data set, an annual panel data for capturing the short-run dynamics, and both a GDP per capita sample delineation and robustness tests delineating the sample on World Bank country-income classifications.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 examines the literature, Section 3 the methodology, with the results in Section 4 and policy implications in Section 5.

The European Commission (EC) pinpoints the importance of public investment to stimulate productivity growth, but in need of fiscal consolidation it is often the case that capital spending is the first to be cut for fiscal adjustment.====South-East European countries have recently scaled up public infrastructure investments, mainly in transports, to raise productivity growth, while improving connectivity and promoting economic cooperation among countries in the region. The European Commission (2016) emphasizes the importance of the TEN-T corridor construction, since rail, road, air and sea transport links are seen as key drivers not just for closer integration between Member States and South-East Europe, but also for increasing economic competitiveness of the region. Moreover, the European Commission emphasizes that further efforts in the implementation of comprehensive structural reforms in transport (among other sectors) are needed to ensure sustainable growth (European Commission, 2017). However, in need for fiscal consolidation some of the investment projects in Montenegro and Macedonia have been delayed, while other postponed.====The main motivation of this study is to assess the macroeconomic effects of public capital spending in South-East European economies and, in particular, whether increasing (cutting) public investment can have positive (adverse) economic effects on output and growth in the long run. There is ample empirical evidence in the literature about macroeconomic effects of infrastructure investment in developed countries (Abiad, Furceri, & Topalova, 2015; Ganelli & Tervala, 2016; IMF, 2014a, among others). Similar evidence for South-East European countries, however, is scarce.====From a methodological point of view, special attention in the aftermath of the crisis has been devoted to identifying potentially non-linear or state-contingent effects of fiscal expenditure shocks. In this respect, several authors find multiplicative effects of fiscal spending in general and infrastructure investment in particular to be significantly higher in economic downturns (Auerbach & Gorodnichenko, 2013a, b; de Jong, Funda, & Vetlov, 2017, among others). In such circumstances not only are the fiscal multipliers significantly higher than one (primarily due to crowding in of private investment and spending), but fiscal stimulus also appears to affect positively the overall indebtedness of an economy measured by the debt-to-GDP ratio (Abiad et al., 2015, among others).====Moreover, all South-East European countries from our sample, except for Croatia, take also part of the group of EU accession (or enlargement) countries, while Croatia is the last country joining EU in 2013. That is why this study is important also from the cohesion perspective and shows the eventual speed and patterns of economic convergence through public investment. Even in time before the crisis and need for fiscal adjustments, the South-East European countries lagged behind the rest of Europe on the two main macroeconomic grounds, growth and labour market developments, while also struggling in competitiveness. Data for 2016 show that the average Euro Area GDP per capita is six times larger than the average GDP per capita in sampled South- East European countries, the unemployment rate is nine percentage points above the Euro Area average, while according to the 2016–2017 Global Competitiveness Report the competitiveness rank difference between Euro Area and South-East Europe is 50 positions.==== The main question in this respect is whether South-East European countries can use public investment to narrow such a gap in the upcoming decades. Empirical evidence for developed economies suggests that public investment could significantly increase the speed of convergence of catching-up countries (Fournier, 2016, among others).====The empirical evidence on macroeconomic effects of public infrastructure spending in South-East European countries is almost inexistent. The scarce literature mainly refers to the effect of total government spending (and revenue),==== providing only single country studies and not a comprehensive multi-country treatment of the region. One of the main reasons for such lack of studies is insufficient data for application of modern estimation techniques, which require the identification of the exogenous changes in fiscal spending. In this respect, our study makes an attempt at filling the gap in the literature and presents an analysis of the macroeconomic effects of public infrastructure investment in South-East European countries for the following countries: Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia and Albania.==== To asses public investment (and government spending) multipliers, we employ the linear projection method introduced by Jordá (2005), but, given the importance of expectations in identifying fiscal shocks for the purpose of this analysis, we also follow the seminal works of Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013a, b). The measure of capital government spending (fiscal) shocks, is obtained as the difference between actual (outturn) capital spending for period ==== and expected (planned) capital spending as in the plan of the budget made in period ==== ====1 for year ====. Such approach singles out unanticipated changes as capital spending forecast errors (FE), while on the same time removing the “fiscal foresight bias” (Ben Zeev & Pappa, 2014; Leeper, Richter, & Walker, 2012, among others) and circumventing the problem of endogeneity in the estimates of fiscal policy effects. Above that, this study encompasses the effects on a larger set of macroeconomic aggregates. Beside the impact on national account data (output, private consumption and private investment), it investigates also the effects of public investment on unemployment and public debt.====Our main results reveal significant multiplicative effects of public investment on GDP in South- East European region. Point estimates of medium-term multipliers are on average above two. The main channel through which public investment delivers such multiplicative effects appears to be crowding in of private investment. While we are not able to confirm positive effects on unemployment rate (with exception of Croatia), public investment, which is primarily debt financed, seems to marginally increase the debt-to-GDP ratio only in Serbia. Our analysis also shows that such positive macroeconomic effects cannot be observed for total government spending, which is an indication that also in South-East Europe public investment can be seen as a catalyst of positive spill-over effect to other sectors of the economy and thus contribute to productivity growth, while social transfers deliver only weak or no multiplicative effects.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the importance of government capital investment for economic growth from a policy and empirical perspective. Section 3 explains the empirical strategy and used data. Section 4 presents the results of the analysis while Section 5 is reserved for policy implications of our analysis.

The requirement of accessibility, however, brings into consideration the corresponding cost and resource utilization. There exists a vast school network in India, with many schools established under the ==== program. However, the existence of too many schools, mostly low in enrolment, is creating problems in terms of quality of teaching and infrastructural facilities offered by these schools. This trade-off between large size schools having good infrastructure and conducive ecosystem, and many small schools deprived of it, can be addressed by appropriate school consolidation. The current study presents a mathematical programming model for school consolidation that aims to minimize the total disruption and transfer the students to an alternative school considering the school network. The model is then applied to a case for a district in the Indian state of Karnataka. Various scenario runs have been done to come out with the appropriate policy parameters for the given district and the results are highly encouraging. The model and analysis can be replicated as well as customized according to the needs of different states.","The Indian school education system follows a K-12 setup which is divided according to grades into primary (I–V), upper primary (VI–VII), secondary (IX–X) and senior secondary (XI–XII) (GoI, 2014). According to Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), 2016–17 data, India has a total of 1,467,680 schools out of which 1,072,836 are government run schools and a total school enrolment of 189,887,015. The average school size in terms of enrolment is 130, the average pupil teacher ratio (PTR) is 22.81, about 7.18% schools are single teacher schools and 4.32% schools have a single classroom to cater to students. The Indian education system has shown a remarkable increase in the literacy rate since independence, from 18.38% in 1950 to 74% in 2011, with a compromise in quality (Pandey, 2006).====The main priorities for an education policy are access, equity and quality (GoI, 2011, 2015; Parruck, Ghosh, & Sheppard, 2014). Access implies rendering educational facilities to students within a location where they can commute easily, which can be in terms of time taken to travel to the school or the distance between their residence and the school. Quantitatively, it varies according to the availability of logistics, geographical characteristics and socio-economic conditions of an area. Availability of public transportation has enabled students to travel more distances in small amount of time (Bard, Gardener, & Wieland, 2006), but transportation facilities are limited, especially in rural parts of India where walking or private vehicles are the only options to reach school. Good accessibility is an important factor to retain the students in schools, which would otherwise lead to dropout. Dropout is a concern when the aim is to provide minimum basic education for everyone, and it also creates problem of under education for the future (Mussida, Sciulli, & Signorelli, 2018).====The second priority, equity stresses on need-based opportunities rather than equal opportunities for all students. A child from a poor socio-economic background will call for more attention (in terms of instructions, textbooks and study material etc.) than someone from a well to do background to reach the same levels of achievement (Mongan, Santin, & Valiño, 2011). The third priority, quality, focusses on measurable learning outcomes and achievements. The focus of the government is now shifting towards quality education for all in its latest five-year plan (Parruck et al., 2014).====With ==== (Government of India programme), the government seeks the universalization of primary education and retention of students by opening new schools in the habitations that did not have schooling facilities (GoI, 2011). This has created about 204,686 primary schools within 1==== ====km of habitations and 159,427 upper primary schools within 3==== ====km of habitations (GoI, 2015), and, many of these schools have low enrolment, limited facilities and have only one teacher to cater to students. These schools have multi-grade teaching where the number of teachers in the schools are less than the number of grades offered by school. Many schools follow the recommended pupil teacher ratio (PTR) of 30:1 at the school level but not at the grade level, and this also leads to multi-grade teaching. This is in spite of the fact that the overall PTR value for India is 24:1 at primary level, 17:1 at upper primary level, 27:1 at secondary level and 38:1 at senior secondary level (GoI, 2016). This results in students of different grades sitting together primarily because it is not economically reasonable to have separate teachers for different grades due to the low levels of enrolment. Schools that face this issue run a risk of totally missing out on the quality aspect. There is a need for school consolidation for better distribution and efficient use of resources due to the presence of large number of single teacher and low enrolment schools.====Schools with even a single student also exist with the teacher travelling a very long distance to teach the only enrolled student (Nair, 2018). Efforts are being made by some Indian states (Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana, etc) to consolidate schools to combine their resources and utilize them efficiently (GoI, 2017). The state of Haryana has merged schools by first combining the same campus schools, then integrating nearby schools having low enrolments and less teachers (GoH, 2014). For the state of Andhra Pradesh, consolidation has been done for schools within 1==== ====km radius for primary schools and 3==== ====km for upper primary and high schools, and the transportation facilities are to be provided if the students are moved beyond this limit (GoAp, 2017). Karnataka closed about 3000 schools whose enrolment is less than 10 and merged them with those having enrolment more than 31 within 1==== ====km radius (Belur, 2016). The state is planning a closure of 28,000 more schools in the current year and providing transportation facilities to the students affected by these closures (Belur, 2018). The state of Rajasthan consolidated schools into composite schools by combining schools with the nearest best performing school and rebranding it as an ==== However, this sometimes led students to travel a few kilometres to reach the new school and very few students turned up in the new school, thus, led to dropouts (Gupta, 2014; Rawal & Ahmed, 2017). The schools having enrolment fewer than 100 students were merged with the ==== (Pal, 2016), due to which the enrolments in ==== increased at a steep rate causing burden on teachers. School consolidation needs to be done in a way that is acceptable to all the stakeholders involved in the education process. India is a diverse country with varied state government policies. There are differences even within various cities and district which shows that same public policies will not be applicable for all states, districts and cities. This requires a sound, that is, rational and objective framework (Suman, Bolia, & Tiwari, 2017). Such a framework should allow for variations required in the details of policy making and implementation to account for the different characteristics of states and districts. School level reforms are one of the important factors for good student outcomes along with socio-economic background of students (Ferraro & Põder, 2018).====Further, the school location related research, overall, has been limited in the Indian context. In view of this, the present study formulates a school consolidation model to decide which schools to close and where to transfer the students. The study uses a modelling approach that combines the ideas of median and set covering methods along with specific needs and constraints of accessibility for a pure facility closure. It also applies the model to a case study for the Indian school system to develop a school consolidation plan. The study is particularly well suited for cases where the main driving force for consolidation is the presence of many schools rather than financial cutbacks and decline of enrolments as in Bard et al. (2006), Bruno and Andersen (1982), Diamond and Wright (1987), Molinero (1988) and Teqi, Liang, Yuchao, and Cong, (2016), etc.====The paper has been organized in the following sections: Section 2 deals with the literature review of the existing models in facility location and school facility planning that leads to the identification of good characteristics of a school relocation plan that includes specifics for the Indian context. Section 3 gives the mathematical model developed for school consolidation. Section 4 presents the case study and results obtained from the model and its effects on various school related factors. It also gives the selection of parameters for each block within a district.

The mandated contribution rate has risen from 3% in 1992, to 9.5% today, and is scheduled to reach 12% by 2025. We use a financial computable general equilibrium (FCGE) model to simulate an increase in the contribution rate. We find that raising the contribution rate has consequences for traditional financial intermediaries, and for financial structure more generally. This is of interest to Australian policy makers currently concerned with the size and role of Australia’s banks, and the leverage of the household sector.","The central pillar of Australia’s retirement income system is defined contribution superannuation. The superannuation legislation enforces mandatory contributions, collected by employers, for virtually all employees during any period of employment. In Australia, these compulsory employer-collected contributions are referred to as the “Superannuation Guarantee”. The mandated Superannuation Guarantee contribution rate (hereafter, “SG rate”) has increased steadily since the scheme began in 1992, rising from 3% to 9.5% in 2018, with the SG rate to peak at 12% by 2025.====A mandated change in the level and allocation of savings of this scale is likely to have consequences for the structure of financial intermediation and the economy more broadly. For example, Australian banks, in submissions to the Financial System Inquiry (FSI), argued that growth of the superannuation sector would affect the supply of bank capital (such as deposits and institutional debt). They advocate policies that support higher deposit growth, a deeper corporate bond market, and allocation of more superannuation funds to bank deposits and fixed income products (Commonwealth of Australia, 2014).====The broader economic implications of pension schemes have been investigated by a number of authors. Vittas (2000) argues that financial markets generally benefit from the creation of funded pension plans via a number of channels. These include an expansion in the number of institutional-quality investors, leading to more financial innovation (e.g., see Bodie, 1990; Diamond & Valdes-Prieto, 1994), better market integrity (via trained professionals employed as part of systemic reforms), improved corporate governance (via institutional investors exercising voting rights in transparent, policy-driven ways), and enhanced financial regulatory and supervisory systems.====As discussed by Fehr (2016), there have been a number of simulation-based analyses of the economic impacts of pension and social security reforms. These typically rely on either lifecycle/overlapping generations models (such as Cerda, 2008, which includes detailed representation of households), or dynamic CGE models, which typically emphasise industry detail. Most recently, Giesecke, Dixon, and Rimmer (2016) use a financial computable general equilibrium (FCGE) model to explore the macroeconomic effects of an SG rate rise. Two limitations of the model used in that paper are the absence of: (i) an active central bank (CB) and monetary policy rule; and (ii) representation of bank capital adequacy regulation. Both limitations are addressed herein, allowing us to explore the implications of an SG rate rise for structure of the financial sector (including intermediaries like the banks) and macroeconomic stability indicators.====Our analysis highlights several implications of an expanded superannuation sector for financial sector structure: (1) banks expand in the short-run due to a rise in the savings rate; (2) bank capital structure is altered in both the short- and long-run, becoming less dependent on deposits and more dependent on bond and equity finance; and (3) non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) expand via an increase in supply of financial capital. With regard to other structural impacts, with potential financial stability consequences, we find: (4) the economy-wide foreign financing requirement falls; (5) the debt-to-equity ratio of the residential housing sector rises; and, (6) the ratio of private debt to income rises.",Mandated superannuation contributions and the structure of the financial sector in Australia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300638,27 May 2019,2019,Research Article,294.0

By means of a stylized small-open economy encompassing barriers to entry in the non-tradable sector and political constraints’ associated with the risk of political instability in a context of heterogeneous agents (rentiers and non-rentiers), we show that alternative situations may materialize. One can have rational expectations equilibria where structural reforms are undertaken when expected (or not implemented when not expected), but also situations where agents’ expectations cannot be fulfilled. Thus, we maintain that economic models should take the possibility of self-defeating expectations into account for policymakers to exercise informed judgement, in particular about structural reforms. Some recent episodes in the euro area are discussed in the light of our model.","The expectation impact on structural reforms (and generally the delicate balance between private and public decisions, filtered through mutual trust/mistrust) is crucial in determining the outcome of any policy aimed at creating a more favorable environment for economic growth. Optimism (pessimism) about reforms’ effectiveness and authorities’ determination in implementing them may dictate their success (failure). However, in certain cases, optimistic (or pessimistic) expectations about these reforms turn out to be self-defeating. This apparent paradox has been evoked with regard to the origin of the European debt crisis. Indeed, after the adoption of the single currency, optimism regarding the ability of the peripheral countries to adapt their economic structure to the new situation was widespread. Rosy beliefs helped attracting foreign capital and reducing interest rates in the periphery, thereby fostering economic growth and diminishing the incentives for the national authorities to implement the much needed reforms (Fernández-Villaverde, Garicano, & Santos, 2013). The outcome was one of limited reforms, at odds with the initial optimistic beliefs, which made the periphery vulnerable when it experienced a sudden stop of capital inflows. In a nutshell, these initial optimistic beliefs turned out to be self-defeating: by acting upon them, private agents created the conditions for their falsification.====The lack of structural reforms and convergence in the euro area represents only one example of the non-trivial relationship between expectations about reforms and the political economy of reforming the ====. By developing a realistic model of structural reforms and showing analytically the relevance of the intuition about self-defeating expectations traps, our work contributes to the literature on the political economy of reforms.==== Moreover, it informs the literature on policy modelling as it shows that, to exercise informed judgement, policymakers need be supported by models taking self-defeating expectations into account.====The issues outlined above are addressed by our model in that it investigates the relationship between (i) private agents’ expectations about reforms, (ii) policy inertia by the authorities,==== and (iii) political economy concerns in a context with heterogeneous agents. The model shows that alternative situations may materialize according to the circumstances: one can have rational expectations equilibria where structural reforms are undertaken when expected (or not implemented when not expected), or alternatively a situation where agents’ expectations cannot be fulfilled. These situations may arise for reasons that have to do neither with ==== agents’ cognitive biases and meta-preferences (about which we remain agnostic)====, nor with learning failures and irrationalities, nor with changes in ideologies and ideas (Rodrik, 2014). The situations we refer to may occur because of the intertwined relationship between the authorities’ objectives and inertia, agents’ expectations, and the political constraints’ associated with the risk of political instability in a context of heterogeneous agents.====Realizing that such situations may occur is very important for modern policymaking: the euro area crisis provides an example of the costs of failing to do so. At the time of the construction of the monetary union, the scenarios envisaged by authorities and scholars shared a common feature, that is the validity of the “there-is-no-alternative” hypothesis, whereby a rational expectations equilibrium with expected and enacted reforms materializes. This only seemingly innocuous assumption rules out various political economy complications and is responsible for the neglect of the risks associated with the materialization of a self-defeating expectations situation.====Clearly, the case of self-defeating expectations neither regards one specific realm of policymaking, nor it affects exclusively the structural reforms ensuring convergence in the euro area. Accordingly, we elaborate a general and flexible model encompassing those elements necessary to create such non-trivial scenarios in policymaking. Although the model is kept as general as possible for this reason, we do follow two specific modelling strategies that deserve some discussion. The first choice regards the inefficiency that represents the object of the structural reforms. To create room for welfare-enhancing structural reforms, we assume the presence of entry barriers in the non-tradable sector, following the several studies providing evidence on their negative impact on the economy.==== The presence of policy barriers granting monopoly power to firms is a well-established example to discuss structural reforms (Eggertsson, Ferrero, & Raffo, 2014; Forni, Gerali, & Pisani, 2010). Similar arguments and model extensions, however, could be developed to encompass other policy-related market imperfections that make the allocation of resources suboptimal.====The second modelling choice we make has to do with the political economy of reforms and the ==== bias, as we need to keep the model tractable but suitable to capture societal cleavages and realistic policy trade-offs. We introduce a distributive conflict among heterogeneous agents: those earning rents because of the existence of entry barriers (the “rentiers”) and those who do not earn rents (the “non-rentiers”). We then posit that the authorities consider the redistributive implications of a liberalization of the non-tradable sector and trade-off the adverse impact of reforms on the rentiers against the possibility that, without reforms, the well-being of the non-rentiers may fall below a threshold at which a policy response is inevitable to avoid social unrest and political turmoil. If it were not for the possibility that the non-rentiers’ well-being falls below the critical value associated with unrest, the authorities would favor the maintenance of the regulatory regime (i.e., the ====) in line with typical collective action problems affecting the non-rentiers and with possible rent-seeking pressures on the authorities by the rentiers (Drazen, 2000; Grossman & Helpman, 2001; Olson, 1971). This representation is in line with the literature showing that policymakers do not maximize simplistic social welfare functions and that economic reforms occur most likely under stressful circumstances (Agnello, Castro, Jalles, & Sousa, 2015; Alesina, Ardagna, & Trebbi, 2006; Drazen & Grilli, 1993; Lora & Olivera, 2004; OECD, 2010; Rodrik, 1996) even when the society at large would benefit from their introduction. Often, policymakers are willing and able to implement reforms entailing a redistribution of resources that endangers certain interests only when failing to reform would affect the remaining population so negatively that social and political stability would be at stake. This is particularly the case for structural reforms that imply regime changes (e.g. a liberalization) rather than marginal adjustments to continuous policy variables.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The building blocks of the model are presented in Section 2. The conditions under which one can have a rational expectations equilibrium and those under which one cannot are in Section 3; a numerical example showing that alternative equilibria may emerge under different political economy parameters clarifies the importance that policymakers are informed by economic models encompassing possible self-defeating expectations traps. Section 4 discusses some recent episodes in the euro area in the light of our model. Section 5 concludes. All mathematical derivations and two extensions of the model are available online.","Policy inertia, self-defeating expectations and structural reforms: can policy modeling cope?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300584,20 May 2019,2019,Research Article,295.0

The empirical findings indicate the lack of short-run causality between pairwise variables. The results of standard Granger-causality (SGC) test demonstrate a bi-directional long-run causality between EC and EG and a uni-directional long-run causality from EC to CS. To forecast variables, the vector ","Due to the changes in industries, transforming mechanical power to electrical power, the emergence of electric motors, and the expansion of machine tools, the electricity consumption (EC) plays a vital role in development of countries. Therefore, planning for production and EC is one of important components in the field of economic. Furthermore, the growing trend of technology, industrial production, spread urbanization, and increasing the welfare level has increased the demand of electricity (Lean & Smyth, 2010). According to the above reasons, EC plays a vital role as a significant index in economic growth (EG) (Zhang, Hu, Zheng, Zhou, & Wan, 2017).====Considering the essential inputs of labor force and capital stock (CS) by focusing on energy consumption, the amount of gross domestic product (GDP) has been enhanced 9% each year on average (Wang, Fang, Guan, Pang, & Ma, 2014; Wang, Fang, Wang, Huang, & Ma, 2015). The production of goods depends on the utilization and the accessibility of electricity, labor, and capital that are supposed as essential indices of production and these indices influence the performance of EG in a country.====The investigation of causal relationship between energy consumption and EG has been evaluated since 1970s with the oil shocks, theoretically and practically (Salamaliki & Venetis, 2013). Due to the importance of electricity as one of the important components of energy, the causal relationship between EC and EG was taken into consideration in the field of energy economics literature by many researchers using several methods for different countries and time periods.====The causal relationship among variables relies on the different country, different dataset, different time periods, different time series model etc. (Abbas & Choudhury, 2013). Salamaliki and Venetis (2013) investigated the causal relationship between energy consumption and real GDP by focusing on CS in G-7 countries with two time series approaches. They concluded that considering on CS in the vector auto regression (VAR) model is especially important as a supplementary variable. Lee, Chang, and Chen (2008) used one of the vector error correction models (VECMs) for estimation of the panel co-integration in 22 OECD countries and found that ignoring the effect of c CS on income causes overestimating the impact of energy consumption. Sarwar, Chen, and Waheed (2017) investigated the causal relationship among EG, EC, oil price, gross fixed capital formation and population by using the panel data covering 1960–2014 for 210 countries.====Some studies have been conducted in the context of analyzing the impact of EC on EG in different countries, such as: Abosedra, Dah, and Ghosh (2009) in Lebanon, Chen, Kuo, and Chen (2007) in 10 Asian countries, Yuan, Kang, Zhao, and Hu (2008) in China etc. One of the pioneering researches in this field was the paper of Kraft and Kraft (1978) that illustrated the presence of Granger-causality from income to energy in the United States. EC consumption to income in Turkey. Ghali and El-Sakka (2004) found a bi-directional short-run causality between output growth and energy consumption in Canada. Lee (2006) examined the causality between income and energy consumption in 11 industrial countries. Bowden and Payne (2009) analyzed the causal relationship between energy consumption and real GDP in the United States within a multivariate framework.====The causal relationship of energy and income without considering other important variables such as capital and labor, might fail to discover appropriate impacts that can be among energy and other variables (Ghali & El-Sakka, 2004; Stern, 2000; Zhao, Zhao, Han, He, & Guo, 2016). Some researches in the literature have focused on the impact of CS on EG. Lee et al. (2008) tested the causal relationship between energy consumption and income to control the CS as total production performance. Soytas and Sari (2006) investigated the impact of a change in energy consumption on income and vice versa in G-7 countries. Ghali and El-Sakka (2004) proposed a framework to explore the causalities among energy, capital, labor, and income as various components of production in Canada.====Several time series models are considered to investigate causal relationships among variables and dynamic behavior among them in literature. Shiu and Lam (2004) used the error-correction model (ECM) to investigate the causality relationship between the real GDP and EC. Yuan, Zhao, Yu, and Hu (2007) utilized co-integration theory and concluded the existence of uni-directional Granger-causality from EC to EG by annual data covering 1978–2004. Lin and Liu (2016) applied the systemic VAR model to find the reason of the large deviation during economic crisis periods. Polat and Ozkan (2019) considered the dynamic transaction between economic activity and financial press applying structural VAR. They concluded that economic activity is notably influenced by financial press in Turkey.====In literature, studies are not limited to presenting a model and conclusions. Some also offer long-run and short-run policies. Thanh, Saito, and Duong (2019) proposed policies such as the allocation of credits to self-employment for increasing the effectiveness of economic activities at micro and macro levels in Vietnam. Lee, Alba, and Park (2018) investigated the impact of industrialization and foreign direct investment policies for economy of developing countries using a threshold effect model. García and Mejía (2018) presented an economic policy at macro level and investigated its impacts on the prices of food, mineral and energy in developing countries. Trlaković, Despotović, and Ristić (2018) examined technological intensity of exported product groups on GDP of Western Balkan Countries. Primus (2018) investigated dynamic transactions in economics applying VAR and the effectiveness of direct and indirect policy in key sectors of three countries.====With respect to the developments in EC, importance of EG by focusing on CS, and also limited researches in this field for Iran, it is of great value to investigate these causalities among EG, EC and CS. Therefore, the main purposes of this paper are as follows:====Following Lee et al. (2008); Lee and Chien (2010), and Salamaliki and Venetis (2013), all variables used in per worker named per capita dividing by labor. Therefore, GDP, EC and CS are collected in per capita units. Using per capita variables prevents correlation between capital and labor, controls scale impacts and avoids dominated changes. Since the hidden idea of per capita evaluates time series variable by influence of labor, it is not necessary to consider labor separately when per capita is used.====The rest of paper has the following structure. Section 2 deals with methodology comprising model, causalities, stationary, co-integration, standard Granger-causality (SGC) tests and impulse response function (IRF) analysis. Section 3 gives the data used and the empirical results. Section 4 provides related policy viewpoints.

This paper contributes to the debate by pointing to the social care services sector –in particular early childhood education and care (ECEC) — as an effective target of fiscal spending for robust employment generation and gender inclusive growth. We use a macro-micro simulation model to examine the aggregate and gender employment impact of increasing public expenditures on ECEC services, an underdeveloped sector in Turkey versus physical infrastructure and construction, a common target of stimulatory spending. Our methodological approach combines input-output analysis on aggregate employment effects with a statistical microsimulation approach to assess distributional outcomes. We find that an expansion of ECEC services creates not only significantly more jobs but also does so in a more gender-equitable and fiscally sustainable way than the a construction boom.","Gender continues to be one of the crosscutting dimensions of social and economic inequalities. Gender gaps in employment and earnings as well as vertical and horizontal gender jobs segregation have proven to be persistent even in cases of robust economic growth. While the extent and patterns of these inequalities vary across different economies, there is widespread consensus that a major source underlying their persistence is the gender imbalance in time allocation to unpaid care work. Women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid work, a structural gendered characteristic of economies in both the global North and South, imposes binding constraints on female labor supply and hence facilitates gender gaps in the labor market (Charmes, 2015; OECD, 2014). Gender policy debates emphasize access to social care services – predominantly childcare, but increasingly also elderly, disabled and ill care- as the most effective strategy for alleviating time restrictions on women’s labor supply and promoting women’s equal access to labor markets (European Commission (EC, 2015; International Monetary Fund (IMF, 2013; UNSG, 2017; UNW, 2016).====Social care expansion depends on public investment and expenditures, hence a matter of fiscal policy. Under conditions of a prolonged global economic recession and austerity, proposals for increasing public expenditures on social care commonly meets resistance on the basis of limited fiscal space. Independent of the question of fiscal space, however, in cases of stimulatory spending or fiscal expansion, the target has usually been physical infrastructure and the construction sector. Gender economists underline such sectoral bias of public investments and spending as evidence of gender blind macroeconomic policy design. A recent assessment by the UN Economic Commission on Europe recommends policy-makers consider the gender impact of sectoral spending decisions to avoid exacerbating inequalities and that stimulatory spending must not only target male-dominated sectors such as construction or infrastructure so as to enable women to benefit from the resulting job creation as well (UNECE, 2014).====An emerging line of recent applied policy research indeed shows that sectoral choices of fiscal spending embody strong implications for gender inclusive growth, which become operational not only through labor supply but also labor demand side effects (Antonopoulos & Kim, 2010; Antonopoulos, Kim, Masterson, & Zacharias, 2014; Ilkkaracan, Kim, & Kaya, 2015; De Henau, Himmelweit, & Perrons, 2017; International Labour Organization (ILO, 2018). The demand-side effect becomes operational through a number of channels. First, given gender jobs segregation, different fiscal allocations across sectors determine whether emerging labor demand will be pro-women or pro-men. Second, given different employment multipliers of sectors (whereby social care service sector is substantially more labor intensive than most other service sectors as well as construction), the choice of sector affects the extent of job creation, income generation, poverty reduction and fiscal sustainability. The role of service sector as an engine of development and growth has received growing attention in the recent literature. Studies find that both traditional services, such as food, personal, and social services, and modern services, such as computer, communications, and business services, may contribute considerably to employment creation and overall economic development due to its labor intensive nature (Eichengreen & Gupta, 2013; Stiglitz, 2016). The output multiplier effect of investing in childcare services is substantially higher than other sectors, such as construction (Warner & Liu, 2006). Moreover expansion of the social care sector contributes to the narrowing of gender employment and pay gaps, not only by initiating the female labor supply response, but also by pro-women composition of labor demand in the care sectors (Ilkkaracan & Kim, 2018).====This literature on implications of sectoral allocation of fiscal spending for gender inclusive growth overlaps with macroeconomic policy debates on the role of fiscal policy as a tool mitigating the prolonged global economic recession. In a seminal piece assessing state of the art in this debate, Stiglitz (2016) points out to lack of aggregate demand and instability as a central problem facing the global economy and the growth of inequality as an important source of the problem. The paper argues that fiscal policy can serve as an effective tool to alleviate inequalities while simultaneously boosting aggregate demand and growth through job creation. While acknowledging the importance of fiscal discipline, Stiglitz (2016) argues that austerity measures in some cases have gone too far by preventing the State to undertake high-return investments, particularly those involving health and education services, which would strengthen aggregate demand and improve longer-term economic growth and societal well-being. The paper concludes with a call for more government investment in innovation, education, health, environment and infrastructure through targeted industrial policies:====This paper contributes to the debate by exploring the potential of the social care service sector as an appropriate target of fiscal spending for promoting inclusive growth. We use a micro-macro policy modeling approach to conduct a simulation on Turkey comparing the employment creation and gender inclusive growth impact of increasing public spending on the social care services sector (in particular early childhood education and care ECEC) versus physical infrastructure and the construction sector. Our variables of policy evaluation for inclusive growth entails potential of each sectoral spending for aggregate employment generation as well as the distributional gender impact instigated through new labor demand. We utilize the input-output (IO) framework to obtain aggregate results on jobs generation and augment it with a microsimulation model to evaluate the distributional outcomes with respect to gender gaps in employment and earnings, and industrial and occupational segregation. Our methodology is distinct from previous studies in two respects: In the aggregate analysis we use a synthetic sector approach distinguishing the cost structure of the childcare sector in the IO Table, enabling us to undertake an accurate estimation of the sector’s employment multipliers. Most importantly, we use a microsimulation model for assessing the distributional impact. We also assess the short-run fiscal feasibility of the public expenditures on the two sectors in terms of increased tax revenues. Our findings highlight important differences in the aggregate and distributional implications under the two scenarios.",Public investment in care services in Turkey: Promoting employment & gender inclusive growth,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300614,18 May 2019,2019,Research Article,297.0

Thus, there is need to examine the stability of the money demand function in Nigeria after the deregulation of the financial sector. To achieve this, the study employed CUSUM (cumulative sum) and CUSUMSQ (CUSUM of square) tests after using autoregressive distributive lag bounds test to determine the existence of a long run relationship between monetary aggregates and their determinants. Results of the study show that a long-run relationship holds and that the demand for money is stable in Nigeria. In addition, the inflation rate is found to be a better proxy for an opportunity variable when compared to ====. The main implication of the study is that ","This study is motivated by two main tendencies in scholarly and policy-making circles, notably: the relevance of stability of money demand in monetary policy in Nigeria and gaps in the extant scholarly literature. The two points are substantiated in chronological order. First, the policy relevance of the study builds on two major strands. On the one hand, the importance of monetary policy after a recession and on the other hand, the importance of historical factors in monetary policy decisions.====With regard to the importance of monetary policy in a post-recession period, it is worthwhile to note that Nigeria grew out of recession in the last quarter of 2017, after experiencing a long period of economic recession with five consecutive quarters of poor economic output. However, Nigeria’s emergence from the recession is slow because the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is less 0.6% while in order to keep up the population growth, an annual GDP growth of 3% is needed (BBC, 2017; Nweze, 2017). Achieving the projected growth is vital through monetary policy if monetary authorities have relevant insights into how various determinants and historical factors affect money demand both in the short term and in the long-run. This is essentially because the quantity of money affects economic output (Asongu, 2016; Asongu, Nwachukwu, & Tchamyou, 2017; Broz & Ridzak, 2017; Rogoff, 2017; Wang, 2016). The above points motivate this study in the perspective that data with deep historical basis is used to assess the long run stability of money demand in Nigeria in order to provide policy insights into how the demand for money could be influenced by policy to stimulate the much needed economic growth in Nigeria. This positioning is even more relevant because of the sparse contemporary money demand literature on Nigeria.====Second, there has been a continuous debate on the nature of money demand in the literature. The debate was anchored on the premise that appropriate monetary policy is designed in line with the nature of the money demand. Poole (1970) argued that money supply serves as the most appropriate monetary policy instrument for the Central Bank when the demand for money is stable. This is based on the premise that the use of money supply as a monetary instrument will result in relative low instability in the economy when the demand for money is stable, compared to the use interest rate. On the contrary, money supply becomes ineffective when money demand is unstable. Given this situation, the use of interest rate serves as the most appropriate monetary policy.====Rao and Kumar (2009), claimed that the use of interest rate by central banks in developing countries is inappropriate as the demand for money in such economies is stable. The authors observed that developing countries, Nigeria inclusive, adopted the use of interest rate since it is commonly used in advanced countries, without giving due recognition to the nature of the demand for money in their economies. According to them, the use of interest rate would have been appropriate if the demand for money function had been unstable. Unstable demand function implies that it is difficult to predict money demand function. By implication, the scale variable and the opportunity variable (which are the determinants of money demand) could not convey much information about money demand. A possible cause of this is the sensitivity of money demand to the opportunity variables. Opportunity variables convey information on the opportunity cost of holding money. Interest rate which, is the return forgone by an economic agent for holding money is an example of an opportunity variable. Hence, as the money demand function becomes more sensitive to interest rate changes, prediction of money demand becomes difficult. The difficulty in predicting money demand promotes the use of interest rate as monetary instrument.====There are a growing number of empirical studies on developing countries that have established that money demand in stable. The results do not support the claim that financial innovation has led to an unstable money demand function in developing countries. Examples of studies within this strand include: Nachega (2001) for Uganda, James (2005) for Indonesia, Kumar (2011) for 20 developing countries and Ndirangu and Nyamongo (2015) for Kenya. Building on these empirical findings, Kumar (2011) has argued that the use of interest rate as a monetary anchor is inappropriate in a country with stable demand function. Hence, it is imperative to ask if the use of interest rate is an optimal monetary policy in Nigeria given the nature of stability of the money demand function in the country. To answer this question, there is need for an empirical study that will provide information on whether or not the demand for money has been unstable as a result of the series of financial reforms implemented in the country since 1986.====This study empirically tests for the stability of money demand in Nigeria using both narrow and broad money. The study uses quarterly data spanning the period of 1992:Q1 to 2015:Q4==== . Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach to cointegration developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith, (2001) is used in the study to test whether or not there exist long-run relationship between monetary aggregates (M1 and M2) and their determinants. From the findings of the study, we conclude that long-run relationships hold. Afterwards, we test for the stability of the money demand function in Nigeria using CUSUM (cumulative sum) and CUSUM of square tests developed by Brown, Durbin, and Evans, (1975). Our results show that both M1 and M2 are stable. This is in line with existing studies carried out in Nigeria, such as Anoruo (2002); Akinlo (2006) and Kumar, Webber, and Scott, (2013), which focused on periods before and after implementation of financial reforms.====It is important to devote space to articulate how the present study departs from the highlighted prior exposition. The data points in the studies by Anoruo (2002) and Akinlo (2006) end prior to the increase in bank capitalisation in 2005, a major reform within the financial sector in Nigeria. The study by Kumar et al. (2013), which accounts for this increase in capitalisation, only focuses on a narrow definition of money while the other two studies have used M2. In the light of these insights, it is difficult to directly compare the findings of the two underlying studies with those of Kumar et al. (2013) because different monetary aggregate measurements are employed. This study therefore accounts for this weakness by: (i) using both M1 and M2 as measures of monetary aggregate and (ii) focusing on the period after the liberalization of the financial sector in 1987==== .",Financial liberalization and long-run stability of money demand in Nigeria,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300596,11 May 2019,2019,Research Article,298.0

These measures are developed by taking into account the association between identity groups and unordered or ordered categories of the well-being indicator and also the disproportionate representation of the populations of the identity groups across the unordered or ordered categories of the well-being indicator. The newly developed measures are characterized and applied to assess the disparities in education and occupational status among the socio-religious groups in India. Empirical findings reveal the existence of between-group ==== in education and occupation in India, and some relevant policies to reduce these inequalities are also suggested.","Segregation is an alternative approach for assessing between-group inequality. It explains group disparity in terms of disproportionate allocation of population of the identity groups defined by caste, religion, sector, gender, region of birth and so on, across the categories of the well-being indicator. Well-being indicator may be education, health, occupation, income and so on. Thus, for assessing segregation the population of a society should be classified by two non-mutually exclusive ways. Firstly, by the categories of the well-being indicator, and secondly, by the categories of the identity groups. Usually irrespective the way of classification of population, there is no ordering of the categories of the identity groups. However, the data of well-being indicators may be nominal categorical or ordinal categorical. For instance, educational categories have inherent ordering; however, the categories of occupation may or may not have any ordering. Therefore, the methods of constructing and the compositions of the summary measures of segregation applicable for two types of data of well-being indicators should be different for effective policy design to reduce the group disparity in the well-being space.====Conventionally, segregation measures were confined within the measurement of disproportionate allocation of two unordered identity groups, such as, black and white, or male and female, across the unordered categories of the well-being indicator or attribute, such as, schools, employment and neighbourhood (Duncan & Duncan, 1955; James & Taeuber, 1985; Butler, 1987; Hutchens, 1991, 2001, 2004; Watts, 1992, 1997, 1998). These measures of segregation are inapplicable to evaluate segregation when there are more than two identity groups and the categories of well-being indicator have inherent ordering.====Concentrating only on the first issue Reardon and Firebaugh (2002) have developed four measures of multi-group segregation based upon four alternative approaches. According to the first approach, segregation is assessed by taking into account the association between the identity groups and unordered or ordered categories of the well-being indicator. The second approach assesses segregation through the disproportionate representation of the populations of the identity groups across the unordered or ordered categories of the well-being indicator.==== The ratio of between-unit diversity and total diversity in the population is used in the third approach. Through the fourth approach segregation is evaluated by averaging the dichotomous segregation indices. Reardon (2008) has focused the second issue and proposed some measures of ordinal segregation by invoking the concept of ordinal variation in the distribution of the attribute. However, the measures of ordinal segregation proposed by Reardon (2008) are not normalized and comparable, as these measures depend not only on group disparity in achievement, but also on the number of groups and population proportion of the groups.====The main objective of this study is to develop some measures of multi-group segregation applicable for nominal categorical and ordinal categorical data by invoking the first and second approaches of Reardon and Firebaugh (2002). In the case of nominal categorical data, we use the simple population proportions across the identity and well-being categories, where in the case of ordinal categorical data we use the cumulative population proportions of the unordered identity groups across the ordered well-being categories. Besides, for constructing one measure of multi-group segregation for ordinal categorical data, we incorporate the concept of ordinal variation as described in (Berry & Mielke, 1992; Blair & Lacy, 1996).====The newly constructed measures of multi-group segregation are also characterized by using a set of axiomatic properties developed from the studies on segregation and between-group inequality (Subramanian, 2001, 2011; Reardon & Firebaugh, 2002; Reardon, 2008; Reddy & Jayadev, 2011a, 2011b; Ray Chaudhury, 2013). It has been found that two out of four measures of multi-group segregation developed in this study are comparable, one from each type of data, and all of these measures are empirically applicable to assess segregation existing in any society. We assess segregation in education and occupational status among the socio-religious groups in India. Accordingly, we suggest some policies necessary to reduce these segregation or between-group inequality in educational and occupational status in India.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section two and three describes the methods of construction of the indices of multi-group segregation for nominal categorical and ordinal categorical data. Section four presents some empirical illustrations of the newly developed measures.

We argue that the effects of those reforms will be different across countries. To understand the reasons for the reform outcome divergence, we advance a novel firm-size distribution (FSDs) argument. At the center of the argument is the fact that FSDs are different across countries and stable over time. Then, if a given doing business reform induces firms of different size to grow differently, this will produce a variety of reform outcomes across countries. To advance the argument, we set up a tractable ==== (GE) model and study how firms of different size grow after a doing business reform. The model predicts that larger firms will grow faster than smaller firms after the reform. The model predictions are tested on the Enterprise Surveys (ES) data, merged with the Doing Business indicators. We confirm that firms of different size grow differently after a Doing Business reform. Thus, based on the notable differences of firm size distributions across countries, identical reforms to start, operate and close a business will produce a variety of reform outcomes across countries.","Doing business reforms have been at the focus of market-oriented policy makers across the globe in the wake of the Great Recession (Stankov, 2017). They have also become bolder more recently, as Table 1 reveals. This paper argues, however, that not all countries that reform will benefit equally from the reforms, even if the reforms were identical.====The explanation offered here is that doing business reforms – i.e., the reforms aimed at reducing the costs to start, operate and close a business affect firms of different size differently. Then, if two countries go through identical reforms but their firm size distributions are ex-ante different and stable, the two economies will grow differently after the reform. Naturally, the argument extends to more than two economies and to more than one doing business reform. It also produces a variety of reform outcomes across countries and possibly over time. Both the literature and the data demonstrate that firm size distributions are different across countries and relatively stable over time. This is our motivation to look at the differences of doing business reform outcomes across countries by using firm-level data.====Our approach is to set up a tractable general equilibrium (GE) model and study how output of firms of different size grows after a doing business reform, which aims at reducing regulatory costs of entry and operation. Our theory suggests that larger firms would grow faster than smaller firms after the reform. This turns into our main hypothesis. We test it on the largest global publicly available firm-level data set, and broadly confirm its validity.====Our theory is in the spirit of Luttmer (2007) and Boedo and Mukoyama (2012) who also use GE models to numerically study the effects of entry and labor regulations on productivity and employment but is set apart in two important ways. First, our paper still entails a micro-founded GE approach but is computationally less intensive and allows for a tractable analytical solution without losing explanatory virtue. Second, none of the theoretical works considers the different effects of regulations across firm size to explain the variety of reform outcomes across countries.====The empirical literature studies the variation of reform outcomes across countries as well. It has been studied for the developed countries (Feldstein, 2017; Perali, Pieroni, & Standardi, 2012), developing countries (Ahmad & Hall, 2017; Bouët, Berisha-Krasniqi, Estrades, & Laborde, 2012; Kant, 2016) and for former transition economies (Campos & Horváth, 2012; Hagemejer, Michalek, & Michalek, 2014), among others who compare the reform outcomes between developed and emerging economies, e.g., Campano, Costantiello, and Salvatore (2016). While some papers place the measurement of reforms at the center of explaining the variation, others extend the modeling work to better understand why institutional reforms produce a variety of growth outcomes. A separate line of literature uses a meta-analytical approach to arrive at similar reform outcome variation across countries (Babecký & Campos, 2011; Babecký & Havránek, 2014).====The debate on the various reform outcomes, predominantly trade, financial and labor reforms has been also lively at the within-country level. Acharya and Cohen (2008) and Buffie and Atolia (2012) study the effects of trade reforms across various income groups and industries; Kinuthia and Murshed (2015); Campano et al. (2016); Gould, Melecky, and Panterov (2016) reveal possible reasons for financial reform outcome divergence; Batyra and Sneessens (2010), Lehmus (2014) evaluate the effects of labor reforms across various workers, and Deppermann, Oermann, and Grethe (2016) compare the effects of reforming agricultural policies in Europe on various farms.====Our approach contributes to the empirical literature by advancing a novel ====. It explains the variety of reform outcomes across countries with the cross-country differences in the structure of firm size.

In quarterly data for the total economy during 2010:Q3 to 2018:Q3 the growth rate of output per hour has been a mere 0.53 percent per year, compared to 1.73 percent per year from 1970:Q3 to 2010:Q3 and 2.80 percent per year between 1948:Q3 and 1970:Q3.==== The slowest previous eight-year interval in the postwar era was 1973:Q2–1981:Q2 with a total-economy growth rate of 0.94 percent per year====, and in data going back to 1889 the only precedent for the slow pace of the last eight years was the eight-year interval extending from the peak of the 1920s boom to the trough of the Great Depression, 1925–33, with an annual growth rate in annual data of 0.53 percent.==== But that earlier episode was clearly a procyclical response to the collapse of output in 1932–33, as the productivity growth rate for the subsequent eight years, 1933–41, was a stunning 4.44 percent per year.====If it were to continue, the slow productivity growth registered in the past eight years would undermine the projection of the Congressional Budget Office that potential real GDP will grow in the next decade at 1.9 percent per year, combining potential growth in the labor force of 0.5 percent per year with potential productivity growth of 1.4 percent per year. The outlook for productivity growth is also central to the Trump administration’s boast that its policies, particularly the recent tax rate reduction and tax reform, will be sufficient to boost the economy’s long-run GDP growth rate from the 2.1 percent achieved during the Obama administration to a permanent rate of 3.0 percent or higher.==== But since much of the Obama-era GDP growth was fueled by a reduction in the unemployment rate, a back-of-the-envelope calculation using Okun’s Law suggests that the implied growth rate of Obama-era potential output since mid-2009 was not 2.1 percent per year but a much lower 0.9 percent per year.==== With the same 0.5 percent potential labor force growth as projected by the CBO, to achieve the Trump 3.0 percent potential GDP boast would require potential productivity growth of 2.5 percent, quintuple the achievement of the past eight years.====A revival in productivity growth could take two forms. First, a rise in output growth above its trend could pull productivity growth above its trend if productivity growth is procyclical, that is, if the gap between actual and potential productivity growth is positively correlated with the output gap. A substantial procyclical productivity response was built into the original formulation of Okun’s Law (1962), which posited that a one percentage point increase in actual output relative to potential output is accompanied by a decline of one-third percentage-point in the unemployment rate and an increase by one-third percent in productivity relative to its trend. Strongly procyclical productivity changes are central to the Real Business Cycle approach which in its extreme form makes “productivity shocks” the sole source of business fluctuations (see Basu & Fernald 2001 for a review of the role of procyclical productivity in macroeconomic analysis). If productivity growth is procyclical, we would expect to see it revive from its poor performance in response to the recent fiscal stimulus that has contributed to an increase in the output gap.====A second avenue for a revival in productivity growth could occur even if the procyclical response is weak or entirely absent. The underlying productivity growth trend could increase in response to higher investment that raises capital deepening and/or to an increased pace of innovation that raises total factor productivity (TFP) growth. There is also the possibility that the productivity trend responds positively to tight labor markets, as an increase in the flow of customers raises work effort without an increase in capital investment.====This paper begins by decomposing the actual growth rates of output and productivity into trend growth and deviations from trend (or “gaps”). We study the cyclical responsiveness of the productivity gap to the output gap in the context of the output identity that divides up output changes by definition into changes in output per hour and in hours of work. The greater the cyclical responsiveness of the hours gap, the less is the responsiveness of the productivity gap, and vice versa.====Our econometric analysis of the procyclical response of the productivity gap reveals a near-disappearance of that response after 1985. Using the post-1985 coefficients we run post-sample simulations in which estimated coefficients are used to calculate the response of the productivity gap to actual and projected changes in the output gap. In one simulation we estimate our equation through 1995 and examine its performance in tracking the productivity growth revival of the late 1990s and early 2000s, showing how simulation errors gradually reveal the emergence of a faster productivity growth trend in that interval. Then we estimate our equation through 2015 and calculate its projected path of the productivity growth gap in response to data on the actual output gap through 2018:Q3 and to a hypothetical output path beyond 2018 through 2021.====The last section of the paper goes beyond the analysis of cyclical gaps and examines the behavior of the underlying trend in productivity growth. We examine the responsiveness of trend productivity growth to capital deepening and to labor-market tightness and ask whether there is an independent effect of tightness on the productivity trend when the contribution of capital deepening is taken into account. We find that the combination of capital deepening and tightness perform well in explaining the productivity growth trend between 1970 and 2007 but fail in opposite directions before and after that interval, explaining much too slow a pace of growth before 1970 and much too fast a pace after 2007. We conclude that labor tightness has only a small direct impact on trend productivity growth, while there is a likelihood of a small productivity trend revival in response to higher investment as it is stimulated by both tax incentives and the indirect effect of tight labor markets.",Prospects for a revival in U.

They merely serve to show what the implications would be of various global trade policy tracks.====The research in this paper is related to three strands of literature. First, in response to the current trade tensions various scholars have started analyzing the implications of different directions for future trade policy. Robinson and Thierfelder (2019) for example also study the implications of future trade policy scenarios for the global economy. However, they focus exclusively on the impact of isolation of the US, developing various scenarios in which the US raises import tariffs on its trading partners and the trading partners respond in various ways. Also, these authors focus on trade outcomes, showing that increased protection by the US will not raise the share of the US in global manufacturing exports, whereas the current paper explores also other outcome variables. In related work, Devarajan, Go, Lakatos, Robinson, and Thierfelder (2018) explore different possible responses of developing countries to additional tariffs imposed by the US, ranging from responding in kind (joining the trade war) to signing more FTAs and reducing tariffs on imports from the US in response (“turning the other cheek”), showing that the latter option would be best for developing countries. Hoekman and Nelson (2018) provide a theoretical framework based on economic and political science to understand the current opposition to the post Second World War liberal trade order, arguing that the prospects for the liberal trade order hinge on the possibility to re-stabilize the relation between the market and civil society, in particular at the supra-national level.====Second, there is recent work on the repercussions of a possible global trade war employing quantitative trade models.==== Ossa (2014) employs a new quantitative trade model showing that Nash-optimal tariffs are on average 62% leading to average welfare losses of 3%. Bouet and Laborde (2018) examine the welfare effects of various responses of US trading partners to tariff increases by the US in a static CGE model, showing that the US would even lose imposing unilateral tariffs without a response of trading partners. Bekkers and Teh (2019) employ the estimates on the difference between cooperative and non-cooperative tariffs in Nicita, Olarreaga, and Silva (2018) to simulate the economic effects of a global trade war in which tariffs rise on average by 32%. Using a dynamic CGE-model global GDP would fall by 2% as a result of changing tariffs from the cooperative to the non-cooperative level.====Third, some long-run projections of the global economy include changes in trade policy in the baseline. Foure, Benassy-Quere, and Fontagne (2013) for example include reductions in trade costs in their baseline projections, based on historical trade growth being larger than income growth and disciplined by empirics on historical reductions in transport costs and tariffs.==== In the current paper changes in tariffs are not part of the baseline and trade growth exceeding income growth is driven by reductions in trade costs because of the implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement and the introduction of new, digital technologies.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the five scenarios are introduced and motivated. Section 3 maps out the methodology, both outlining the structure of the dynamic CGE model and providing details on the implementation of the five scenarios. Section 4 presents the simulation results and Section 5 contains the concluding remarks.",Challenges to the trade system: The potential impact of changes in future trade policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300420,9 May 2019,2019,Research Article,303.0

Major US trading partners have responded by retaliating, also outside of the WTO. Tentative truces are in place with major trade partners (e.g., Japan and the European Union) and the only trade war currently underway is with China, with the recent possibility of a truce. The new US approach to trade policy is to negotiate bilateral trade deals with elements of managed trade rather than pursue broader free trade agreements, and to include foreign policy objectives in trade agreements.====The US policy of operating outside of the WTO rules has led to growing concern that the US is seeking to undermine and perhaps destroy the rules-based trading system centered on the World Trade Organization (WTO), returning world trade to the protectionist and chaotic conditions of the 1930s.==== US withdrawal from participation in global trade under WTO rules would represent a sea change in the workings of the global economy. Can the rest of the world maintain the momentum for global integration and adapt, with little cost, to a reduced role of the US in world trade? Or will US withdrawal bring down the entire rules-based global system?====Tentative answers to these two questions are “yes” and “no”. Experience so far is that the rest of the world is moving ahead with many new regional trade agreements, without the US, supporting deeper integration and the rules-based system, except in their relations with the US. Powerful economic forces have been at work over the post war period expanding trade and fostering economic integration that provide the basis for an optimistic view of the world’s ability to continue these trends without continued US participation.====In this paper, we first examine the broad trends in global trade in the post-war period, focusing on trends in regional as well as global integration. We then consider long-run scenarios of increased US import protection and of possible reactions by the rest of the world. We consider three questions: (1) Is a policy of trade diversion away from the US toward other markets feasible? (2) What are appropriate policy choices for countries in this new global environment? (3) What is the impact on the protected sectors? Our results, using a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) simulation model, suggest that: (1) global adjustment to US disengagement is feasible—the required changes in trade shares are modest and achievable, with little impact on the volume of global trade; and (2) if the US engages in trade wars with its major partners, the best response for other trade partners is to sit out the trade war, accept higher US tariffs, and gain markets from global trade diversion around the US; and (3) there is a fallacy of composition in import protection—widespread tariffs have indirect effects such that they end up damaging the protected sectors.",Global adjustment to US disengagement from the world trading system,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300456,6 April 2019,2019,Research Article,305.0

This situation was highlighted by Calvo and Reinhart (2002), and called “fear of floating”.====Under the IT regime, the fear of floating is clearly related to the fear of inflation and to credibility problems, and both can be justified by the fear of the monetary authority concerning the pass-through effect from exchange rate devaluation to domestic prices (Ball & Reyes, 2004, 2008; Calvo & Reinhart, 2002).====According to Calvo and Reinhart (2002), one of the main reasons for the existence of fear of floating is the lack of monetary policy credibility. However, the work of Calvo and Reinhart (2002) does not provide any empirical evidence regarding the effect of such credibility. In fact, as far as we know, there is no study addressing the fear of floating that has empirically investigated the effect of credibility on such fear.====Based on the theoretical argument of Calvo and Reinhart (2002) that monetary policy credibility is important to reduce the fear of floating, this study empirically analyzes the case of the Central Bank of Brazil (CBB). Hence, this study contributes to the literature once it is the first to empirically investigate this relation in the context of a developing country.

The crisis is the result of a series of concomitant factors. Although policymakers were able to prevent the Great Recession of 2008–2009 from collapsing into a downward spiral reminiscent of the 1930s Great Depression, its economic and social costs undermined public confidence in the predominant economic paradigm and the way it has shaped the global economy. In addition, mainstream policymakers have not been able to address effectively some of the negative side effects of globalization (growing inequalities within countries, large economic imbalances, tax arbitration and erosion of the tax base). Despite some significant developments in global governance, with the establishment of the G20 as a prime forum for international economic coordination, important opportunities to move forward on the multilateral track (e.g., the completion of the Doha Development Round) and further reform the global economic order (e.g., WTO modernization) were missed. Last but not least, some economies that joined the international economic order at a later stage have bend some of its rules to maximise their economic and strategic advantages, sometimes at the expense of other countries. As a result, the support of some key players for the postwar multilateral economic order has become lukewarm, and a growing group of political leaders are now overtly arguing for the need to move away from it. Still, most countries and policymakers consider that the international economic system needs to remain rule-based and strongly anchored in multilateralism, but they struggle to act together in its defence.

This amounted to 15.7% of the world’s total. China was the second largest importer with 11.1% of the world’s total. In the United States, the share of imports in GDP has been annually higher than the corresponding share of exports in GDP for decades (Fig. 1). Over the period 2000–2017, the average trade deficit was 3.87% of GDP, with no sign of improvement. One way to reduce the national debt, is to reduce the external deficit and that can be done by either reducing imports or increasing exports (or some combination of both). Most developing Asian countries have been successful narrowing their external deficit by following the post-war Japanese model of export promotion while developing countries elsewhere did not do as well employing import substitution policies. However, part of the reason that import substitution policies have not worked for developing countries is because of the delay it takes to develop a comparative advantage when the country lacks the technologies of the more advanced countries. However, if the United States practices import substitution, lack of technology will not be a binding constraint to growth. In this paper, we will simulate some of the results for the United States and 19 of its major trading partners which constitute 75% of the market for US exports.

The first aim of the paper is to organize historical growth accounts in a new way that highlights the role of educational intensity in U.S. economic growth. Previously, the importance of education in economic growth appeared as improvements of labor quality in the sources of growth. Additional investment in human capital appeared in expanded economic accounts that incorporate human capital, such as Fraumeni, Christian, and Samuels, (2017).====The second aim of this paper is to incorporate educational intensity into a medium-term projection for U.S. economic growth. We base this projection on the following assumptions: (i) a projection of the population and employment-population ratios, (ii) a projection of industry TFP growth that accounts for educational intensity, and (iii) a projection of capital quality growth. This also includes a projection of labor quality growth, which continues to be low in comparison to our historical estimates.====In this paper we classify industries by educational intensity. This allows us to associate economic growth at the industry level with the educational characteristics of the work force. This approach demonstrates the relationship between educational intensity and U.S. growth and productivity. We are among the first to consider the link between economic growth and characteristics of labor input in a KLEMS framework. For example, we document the relationship between the share of educated workers in an industry and its productivity growth rate.====We develop a set of growth accounts that identifies the 65 industries in the U.S. National Accounts and classifies these according to their intensity of use of highly educated workers. We find that a disproportionate share of the high TFP growth industries are in the educationally intensity group. As part of this TFP calculation, we extend the U.S. growth accounts in Jorgenson et al. (2017) to cover the postwar period 1947–2015.====A substantial literature has discussed the extent and causes of the falling trend in labor force participation rates (LFPR) since the peak in 2000. Earlier studies of the LFPR, such as Kudlyak (2013) and Toossi (2013), took into account the differences among age and gender groups but did not consider the education dimension. Aaronson, Hu, Seifoddini, and Sullivan, (2014); Aaronson, Cajner et al. (2014), Jorgenson et al. (2017), Montes (2018) and Abraham and Kearney (2018) included the effects of the sharper drop in participation rates among the less educated workers during the Great Recession.====The strand of papers focused on the LFPR, or employment-population ratios, does not make an explicit link between them and effective labor input. There are at least two possible ways in which they are related. The first is that the differential rise in participation rates among different age and education groups leads to a change in labor quality. The second is that different gender-age-education composition of workers among the various industries could respond differently to an increase in the relative supply of highly educated workers. As we document below, industries have wide range of TFP growth so that uneven recoveries of the LFPR’s could affect the growth of aggregate TFP.====Projections by the CBO (2018) take the total number of workers from LFPR models and use this directly in an aggregate output function. The SSA (2018) assumes an aggregate productivity growth rate independent of the labor force projections. The only papers that explicitly recognize the implications of different LFPR’s for labor quality are Bosler, Daly, Fernald, and Hobijn, (2019) and Jorgenson, Ho, & Samuels (2019).====Fig. 1 shows how the employment-population ratios differ among the various educational groups.==== Before projecting the employment-population trends for the medium-term, we first describe the large differences in levels and trends for the various demographic groups in Fig. 1. Comparing the male rates in the left-hand graphs with the female rates on the right, we see that there is a gap of 10 percentage points or more. The largest gap is during the peak fertility age. Across the age groups for the college-educated men and women, the differences in employment-participation (EP) rates within the 25–54 age group are small. For women with only High School education, the EP rate for the 25–34 age group is significantly lower than that for the 35–54 group. For prime-age (25–54) men, those with BA’s have EP rates around 90%, while those with High School diplomas have rates less than 80%. Prime-age women with BA’s have rates around 75–80% compared to the High School group rates around 60–70%.====The period covered in Fig. 1, 2008–2017, shows the impact of the Great Recession and the slow recovery of participation rates. We note the following features of these trends. For men in the 25–54 age group, for all education levels, the EP ratios have not recovered to the pre-crisis levels in 2007. For men aged 55–64, the ratio recovered to or exceeded, the 2007 levels. For all age groups of women with High School education the EP ratios have not recovered. For women with BA degrees, the EP ratios have largely recovered, and in the 55–64 age group, exceeded the 2007 level.====We find that projected U.S. economic growth for the decade 2017–2027 will be considerably lower than growth over the past quarter century. Education is likely to continue to buoy economic growth through industries that employ educated workers, rather than upgrading the educational qualifications of the labor force. Our Base Case projection of U.S. GDP growth is 1.86% per year for the period 2017–2027.

The fears are expressed both in professional writings of economists and in popular stories. We here give a brief history of narratives expressing these fears and briefly consider the relevance of such narratives for public policy.====The term “narrative” is often used as a synonym for “story,” a sequence of events. But the word narrative has an important other aspect. A narrative is a ==== of a story, that attaches meaning and significance to it, that often is intended as providing a lesson or a moral. A narrative can become an interpretation of ongoing events by comparing them with a story. With economic narratives, the narrative may represent a proto-economic model, understandable by the most general public.====Especially important among narratives are those about our life’s work—our jobs. While people in jobs of low prestige may not express much delight in telling the story of their life of work, it is a story they think about and that defines their contribution to loved ones and to society.====In my 2017 American Economic Association presidential address ====,==== and in a forthcoming book with the same name, I have been arguing that it is important for economists to appreciate the popular economic narratives that go viral, that come and go according to epidemiological patterns. Just as a disease, an economic narrative, a story that is connected to things that matter in the economy, rises like an epidemic to influence a large fraction of the population. The epidemic alters their economic actions and their voting. It then influences government economic policy, and also drives economic fluctuations. During the growth phase of the narrative epidemic, the contagion rate has to be above the forgetting rates, allowing the narrative to grow in influence. Eventually the narrative fades away, after the contagion rate falls below the forgetting rate. Then the narrative may mutate, as viruses do, and another epidemic may return again, and again.====In this paper I will present a brief history of thought on both professional and public narratives related to the effects of machines replacing jobs. The immediate concern most expressed is that one will lose a job altogether, resulting in poverty and unemployment. But the spell of unemployment may not be the dominant concern. There is also the fear that the resulting eventual job switch will be to a job that is demeaning.====In a psychologically healthy environment, narratives establish honored membership in community. Everyone wants to be loved. Everyone feels a deep need to be part of a community that at the very least respects one’s contribution.

More specifically, we document how the shape of the Phillips curve has changed at different frequencies over time. Our estimation strategy relies mainly on frequency domain analysis but is also complemented by time domain analysis. We emphasize the relationship at the long/medium-run and business-cycle horizons that correspond to low==== and business-cycle==== frequencies, respectively.====Notwithstanding similar levels of economic development and monetary policy adopted by central banks, Australia can be distinguished from other economies by its economic structures and labor market relations. Australia is a resourced-based small open economy highly integrated into the world economy that did not suffer from the recent global financial crises. Recently, its international integration has shifted from the developed western economies to China. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) adopted aggregate monetary targeting in 1976 and inflation targeting in 1993. There was a real wage shock in 1974 caused by labor unions that also coincided with the first oil price shock. There were also agreements between the Australian Labour Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s on nominal wage setting to control inflation. Changes in the monetary policy regimes and wage setting behaviors in the labor market may have contributed differently to the inflation-unemployment dynamics at different points in time and across frequencies, and justify an independent investigation for Australia.====The idea of Friedman (1968) and Phelps (1967) that a permanent change in inflation does not lead to a permanent change in unemployment, commonly known as the vertical long-run Phillips curve, has been accepted as one of the pillars of modern macroeconomics. Recent empirical evidence, however, suggests a non-vertical long-run Phillips curve and a changing slope over time depending on the sample period studied. For example, in the case of the USA, whose inflation-unemployment relationship has been most extensively studied, King and Watson (1994; 1997) documented a strong negative correlation at low frequencies from 1954 to 1969, and no consistent relationship from 1970 to 1987, but an overall positive correlation from 1954 to 1992. Berentsen, Menzio, and Wright (2011), using data for longer periods from 1955 to 2005, document a strong positive correlation at low frequencies.==== In contrast, several recent commentators have documented a flattened downward sloping long-run Phillips curve as a result of anchored inflation expectations from 2000 onwards (Benigno & Ricci, 2011; Fuhrer, 2011). Akerlof, Dickens, Perry, Bewley, and Blinder (2000) earlier predicted that low inflation may cause unemployment to persist at high levels, thus flattening the long-run Phillips curve. Conversely, the business-cycle Phillips curve remains downward sloping although the degree of the inflation-unemployment trade-off has changed over time. Kuttner and Robinson (2008) also observe a flattened long-run Phillips curve at low inflation in Australia.==== There are studies that document the Phillips curve in Australia for different periods (discussed in Section 2), but whether and how the long-run and business-cycle Phillips curves have evolved over time is not well-understood. This paper is also intended to fill this gap.====This paper departs from the extant literature in some important respects. We document the Phillips curve for Australia at all frequencies using the recent data. We employ a combination of frequency and time domain methods; in our specific context, the frequency domain (spectral) method estimates the relationship at each frequency except at zero (see Section 5), which is complemented by the cointegration method in the time domain at zero frequency. It is important to note that most studies in the context of Australia infer about the long-run Phillips curve from the estimation of the (time varying) equilibrium unemployment rate (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)) rather than directly estimating it. Their approach provides information only about the zero frequency, ignoring other frequencies containing information about the long-run. Conversely, regression using the low-pass (or band-pass) filtered series estimates a coefficient that is the average of the regression coefficients over the long-run (business-cycle) frequencies. The frequency domain method, unlike its time domain counterpart, allows us to investigate the inflation-unemployment relationship without relying on any identifying restrictions on the relationship.==== The frequency domain method also allows us to investigate the lead or lag in the relationship (direction of causality) within the same framework.====We first identify the periods over which the patterns in the long-run relationship between the CPI inflation and unemployment are qualitatively different.==== Rather than identifying break(s) in the individual inflation or unemployment series, we identify break(s) in their relationship. The evolving patterns in the relationship can be visualized by displaying the data transformed by low-pass filtering in which the filter weights are derived based on the Baxter and King (1999) band-pass filter. We observe the first break during 1974–76 and a second sharp break in 1993. The timing of these breaks coincides with the adoption of aggregate monetary targeting in 1976 and inflation targeting in 1993 by the RBA, respectively. Based on these observations, the three distinct periods are defined as i) pre-1977, ii) 1977–1993, and iii) post-1993. The real wage shock due to union pressure and the oil price shock, both in 1974, just preceded the adoption of monetary targeting and may have contributed to the first break. In the pre-1977 period, the long-run Phillips curve is upward sloping and very steep. In the 1977–1993 period, a clear long-run trade-off (downward sloping long-run Phillips curve) emerges, and the long-run Phillips curve flattens, becoming near horizontal in the post-1993 period. These evolving patterns warrant a separate analysis of the Phillips curve for each of these distinct periods. In contrast, the business-cycle Philips curve, visualized from the band-pass filtered data, is downward sloping in all periods although the magnitude of the slope differs across periods.====We then proceed to analyzing the inflation-unemployment relationship in the frequency domain for each period. Our analysis is based on the gain and phase spectrum (see Online Appendix A.1 for the estimation method in the frequency domain). The gain is analogous to the absolute value of the regression coefficient of unemployment on inflation in the time domain. Given that the gain is positive by definition, we complement it with the slope of the linear fit in the time domain after transforming the series by the appropriate filter. The phase measures the lead or lag in the relationship. For example, if the phase of unemployment with inflation is negative, then it is inferred that inflation is a lagging variable; in other words, the causality runs from unemployment to inflation.====Absent any permanent changes in inflation, the data will be uninformative about the long-run Phillips curve. Sargent (1971) and Lucas (1972) criticized testing such a curve using reduced form econometric methods based on the premise that if inflation is not an integrated process, there is no permanent change in the level of inflation following a shock, and the long-run relationship is not identified. In contrast, application of the spectral method requires the series to be stationary. Our statistical tests also suggest that the inflation and unemployment series are nonstationary (except the inflation in the post-1993 period). To address this dilemma, we estimate the Phillips curve in its deviation form because unemployment and inflation gaps are considered to be stationary. The former is the deviation of actual unemployment from the time-varying NAIRU, and the latter is the deviation of actual inflation from its time-varying expected level. This specification can be regarded as the reduced form expectations-augmented Phillips curve that examines how the inflation deviates from its expected level at different frequencies when the unemployment gap deviates from zero. The NAIRU and expected inflation, both of which are unobservable, are estimated by employing the Unobserved Component Model. It is worth mentioning that the application of the UCM in the unemployment and inflation series removes information only at the zero frequency, and our frequency domain analysis therefore estimates the relationship at all but the zero frequency. The low frequency range is chosen as (0+, 0.196) and the business-cycle frequency range as (0.196, 1.048), which are based on quarterly data and assume business-cycle periodicities of 6–32 quarters. Given that zero frequency contains important information about the long-run, we complement our frequency domain analysis by employing the ARDL cointegration test to determine the relationship at the zero frequency.====The results show that in the pre-1977 period, the gain is significant at the high frequency components in the long-run (32–71 quarters range-medium-run frequencies); it is also significant in most of the business cycle frequencies, including around the cut-off at 0.196. In contrast, the gain is significant at all long-run frequencies (32 quarters and above) in the 1977–1993 period; it is also significant at the lower range in the business cycle frequencies. In the first period, the fit estimated in the time domain using the low-pass filtered series (in the (0+, 0.196) frequency range) is upward sloping, while the same is downward sloping in the second period. We conclude a medium-run positively sloped Phillips curve in the pre-1977 period, and a long-run negatively sloped Phillips curve in the 1977–1993 period. We suggest that important changes in labor market relations rather than monetary targeting in 1976 was responsible for this downward sloping long-run Phillips curve. The fit using the band-pass filtered series is negative in both periods, suggesting a downward sloping business-cycle Phillips curve. For the post-1993 period, the gain is insignificant in the entire low frequency range. The cointegration test suggests a presence of relationship at the zero frequency only in the 1977–1993 period. The phase indicates no definite lag or lead between inflation and unemployment in the pre-1977 period but unemployment lagged inflation in the 1977–1993 period.==== The causality changes sharply over the business-cycle frequencies, especially in the 1977–1993 period, suggesting instability in the relationship.====Although our results in the frequency domain are, to some extent, consistent with previous results in the time domain, they highlight several important patterns that are not apparent in the time domain. There are enormous fluctuations in the relationship (gain) even within a particular frequency band in terms of both the magnitude and statistical significance. For example, in the 1977–1993 period, in addition to large fluctuations, the gain is significant only at lower frequencies in the business-cycle frequency band (close to the medium-run frequency band), and in the pre-1977 period, it is significant only at the higher frequencies in the lower frequency band. Similar fluctuations in the direction of causality are also observed across frequencies.====Our results are important from policy perspectives. Notwithstanding that the long- and medium-run relationship between inflation and unemployment varies across different periods, there is invariably a negative relationship between them at the business-cycle frequencies although the magnitude fluctuates across periods and frequencies. Therefore, the role of monetary policy to stabilize fluctuations over the business cycles has not diminished. This is true for the post-1993 inflation-targeting period during which the Phillips curve has flattened and many have raised concerns about the efficacy of conventional monetary policy for stabilization.====Development in the labor market relations is probably unique in Australia but central banks in many developed countries have adopted inflation targeting as the monetary policy instrument since 1990s. It raises an obvious question whether other inflation-targeting countries have also experienced a similar inflation-unemployment relationship. To get a sense, we briefly focus on this issue by documenting the relationship in several other inflation-targeting countries such as Canada, Sweden, New Zealand and the UK in the time domain. The results are presented in Online Appendix A.2. We find that these countries have experienced similar inflation-unemployment relationship as in Australia since they adopted inflation targeting, but the relationship in the pre-inflation-targeting period varies across countries.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature on the Phillips curve in Australia. Section 3 provides a brief history of monetary policy in Australia. Section 4 describes the long-run and business-cycle relationship in the time domain. Section 5 discusses the Phillips curve model that we estimate in the frequency domain. Section 6 graphically presents the Phillips curve in the frequency domain. This section also presents the time domain results at the zero frequency. Explanations for the evolving patterns in the long-run relationship are also discussed in this section.

It is showed that the open-ended APP is more effective in stimulating macroeconomic conditions than committing ex ante to an ending date.,"In January 2015 the ECB extended its asset purchase programme (APP) to euro-denominated investment-grade securities issued by euro-area (EA) governments and institutions in the secondary market. The reason for this decision was the progressive fall of inflation that was leading to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations from levels consistent with price stability and risks of a deflationary spiral. In December 2016 the ECB started a recalibration of the APP.==== The design of this recalibration involved several decisions about its timing, size, and composition. A feature of the recalibration was the choice between a programme with an end date for the net purchases that is announced and a programme that remains open-ended. The ECB chose to maintain the possibility of extending the flow of future net purchases beyond the horizon of the purchases to which it made explicit commitment. A careful communication was used, based on the concept of “central bank reaction function,” aimed at managing agents’ (households’ and firms’) expectations about future purchases of sovereign bonds, linking them to expected future macroeconomic conditions.====In this paper we evaluate the macroeconomic effectiveness of the announcement of an open-ended APP. To this purpose, we build a large-scale New Keynesian dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated to the EA and the rest of the world (RW). The EA is modeled as a monetary union of two regions, Home and rest of the EA (REA), where Home is of medium size (its GDP being around 20% of overall EA GDP).====We assume that an open-ended programme implies no explicit commitment by the central bank to end the purchases. Agents form their expectations about future, not yet announced, asset purchases that the central bank would implement in the quarters past the announced horizon according to a central bank reaction function. The latter links the expected purchases to the expected inflation gap, i.e., the distance of expected inflation from the target. If the expected inflation gap is positive, i.e., if expected inflation is below the target, then agents expect additional purchases (that have not been announced) and no purchases otherwise. The central bank reaction function is estimated by agents on the basis of the inference that they may have drawn from previous purchases announcements.==== We provide an empirical foundation of the reaction function by estimating the elasticity of expected purchases to the expected inflation gap using data on announced additional purchases and the inflation gap in correspondence of the considered announcement. The estimated elasticity is positive and significant, in line with evidence provided by financial analysts.==== This allows us to discipline the results of our simulations from a quantitative point of view.====We use the ECB October 2017 announcement on the pace and amount of future purchases as a case study for our analysis. The APP consists of purchases of long-term sovereign bonds by the EA central bank. Following Chen, Curdia, and Ferrero (2012), we assume that in each EA country some households (labeled “restricted”) invest in domestic long-term sovereign bonds and physical capital (they do not invest in short-term bonds). This feature captures the presence of investors who have a demand over specific asset classes and maturities, as formalized in the preferred-habitat framework. The presence of these agents allows us to obtain real effects from central bank purchases of long-term sovereign bonds, as those households’ decisions depend only on long-term rates.==== The rest of the households (labeled “unrestricted”) have instead access to multiple asset markets and, in particular, their decisions are directly affected by the short-term monetary policy rates. Moreover, we assume forward guidance (FG) on the short-term policy rate, i.e., the central bank announces the number of periods the policy rate should be expected to remain at its current (baseline of the model) level. The other model features are in line with those of existing large-scale dynamic general equilibrium models of the EA, like the Eurosystem’s EAGLE (Gomes, Jacquinot, & Pisani, 2010) and the ECB’s New Area Wide Model (Christoffel, Coenen, & Warne, 2008).====We consider several scenarios. We compare purchases under a “full” announcement (i.e., an announcement of a purchasing programme that specifies both the overall path of future purchases and their end date) to the case of an “open-ended” announcement, in which the end date is not specified and the possibility of additional future purchases is communicated. All announcements are accompanied by the FG. In its announcements, the ECB connected the end of the FG to the end of the APP by explicitly communicating that monetary policy rates should be expected to remain at their present (low) levels for an extended period of time, and, crucially, past the horizon of net asset purchases. This assumption on the FG is consistent with the wording of ECB official communication, according to which the first rate hike would occur only “well past the horizon” of net asset purchases (Draghi & Constancio, 2017). Moreover, we assess the effectiveness of the two alternative programmes when a negative shock to EA aggregate demand reduces EA inflation and, thus, widens the gap from the inflation target.====Our results are the following. First, the announcement of an open-ended APP is more effective in stimulating macroeconomic conditions than an announcement that commits to an end date. Given the initial positive inflation gap, agents expect additional purchases in the case of open-ended APP. Thus, the long-term interest rate decreases more than in the case of announcing an end date and economic activity and inflation increase more. Second, the effectiveness of the open-ended programme is reinforced by the FG. In particular, for a given amount of announced purchases, keeping the monetary policy rate unchanged past the purchases’ horizon stimulates economic activity and reduces the expected inflation gap. This induces households to expect a lower amount of additional (unannounced) purchases. Third, the open-ended APP is more effective in stabilizing the economy if negative EA aggregate demand shocks unexpectedly materialize and push down inflation. In this case, the widening of the inflation gap associated with the shocks induces agents to expect a larger amount of additional purchases by the central bank.====Among the recent studies that analyze the effectiveness of the APP, there is a growing consensus that the adoption of the APP has had both financial and real effects, and that the latter are mostly consistent with a portfolio rebalancing channel.==== Different from previous studies, our exercise features two EA-specific characteristics, i.e., the monetary union and open-economy dimensions, and attempts a first description of expectations formation by private agents in presence of an open-ended programme. In Ellison and Tischbirek (2014) asset purchases are carried out according to a systematic rule. As in that contribution, we endogenize purchases as a function of the inflation gap, using the reaction function. Different from it, we assume that the central bank does not systematically follow the reaction function (which is not a systematic rule), but follows it only for a limited number of periods after the announcement of the open- ended programme. Burlon, Gerali, Notarpietro, and Pisani (2017) study the macroeconomic effectiveness of an APP with announced end-date under different assumptions regarding the duration of the purchases and of the FG. One of the main conclusions of that paper is that the more distant in the future the announced closing date of a programme, the larger the (current and future) effectiveness of the programme itself. The model used in our analysis builds on the one in Burlon et al. (2017) with one crucial departure, i.e., the presence of the central bank reaction function in the case of an open-ended programme. Households know the function and use it to form their expectations about future unannounced asset purchases by the central bank.====Our analysis clarifies the relevance of central bank communication for the effectiveness of non-standard measures, and, in particular, the ability of the central bank to shape, through (past and current) announcements, agents’ expectations about future unannounced purchases. Communication allows the central bank to manage expectations of economic agents. This is particularly relevant when macroeconomic conditions and the monetary policy tools are not the standard ones and, thus, are not well known by economic agents and/or their functioning and interaction is difficult to explain to the public.==== We are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to make this type of analysis in a fully-fledged New Keynesian model.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the main features of the model, in particular the non-standard monetary policy measures (sovereign bond purchases by the central bank) and the formation of agents’ expectations on future purchases by the central bank in the case of open-ended APP. Section 3 describes the simulated scenarios and the corresponding results.

Both regions have similar climate, lifestyle and agricultural activities but North was facing war while there was no war on terrorism in South. Data were collected from 110 respondents through interviews by using structured questionnaire. In estimated models, North Waziristan farmers’ income was significantly lower than the South Waziristan farmers due to military operation induced by terrorism. Government of Pakistan can enhance farm income by promoting education, livestock, orchard farming, market access and extension services.","After 9/11 attack, the incidence of terrorism increased by many folds in the world. Pakistan is paying a huge price due to its role as a frontline state in the war on terror. The total number of terrorist incidents took place in Pakistan were 13,721 during 2001–2013. During 2001–2005 there were only 523 terrorist incidents but during 2006–2013 numbers of terrorist incidents were increased up to 13,198 (Khan, 2014). Terrorism decreases economic growth and has negative impacts on consumption, production and investment in an economy. Although terrorism increased foreign aid and borrowing but makes difficult to sustain economic and social expenditures. Terrorism is a serious threat to the internal security of Pakistan and directly affects its social, political and economic structure (Daraz, 2008; Khan, 2007).====One major impact of terrorism is human loss and due to it thousands of peoples lost their valuable lives. Estimated number of worldwide deaths from terrorism rose from 3329 in 2000 to 32,685 in 2014. The global economic cost of terrorism was increased by 61% in 2014 over the previous year. The economic cost of terrorism reached to the highest level in 2014 and was equal to 52.9 billion USD while in 2013 it was 32.9 billion USD. From 2001 to 2014, the total global economic cost of terrorism was about 245 billion USD (Institute for Economics & Peace, 2015). In Pakistan due to terrorist attacks, the annual death toll has risen from 163 in 2003 to 3318 in 2009 (The Express Tribune, 2011). Total numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents from the year 2003 to 2016 were 27,587 while the total number of militants killed were 32,971 (South Asia Terrorism Portal, 2016).====Terrorism has adverse negative impacts on the economy and to eliminate terrorism from a county/region, military operations are carried out. The military operation is a planned and controlled movement by the armed forces and comprises of actions of a state in response to undesirable law and order situation. These actions are designed military plans to resolve issues and control the situations in the state’s interest (Glantz, 1991). The objective of military operations induced by terrorism was to destroy militancy infrastructure and power, remove insurgency, and restoration of peace in the region (Shareen, 2004). Since 2001, Pakistan army carried out eight major military operations against the militants and terrorism insurgency movements. Out of eight major military operations in Pakistan, five of them were carried out in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The main reason behind this large number of military operations in FATA is its shared border with Afghanistan in North and West where international forces have been fighting war against terrorism since 2001. In fact war against terrorism in Pakistan has adverse negative effect on its economy but especially on FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) regions. FATA and KPK regions are famous for agriculture, tourism, manufacturing and small-scale industries in Pakistan.====Agriculture is the major and the most important sector in the economy of Pakistan. It provides employment to 43.50% of total labors force and contributes 21% to the gross domestic product (GDP). About 61% of its population lives in the rural areas and agriculture is the main source of their livelihood (Government of Pakistan, 2015). In Pakistan, the majority of the cultivators belong to the category of small or marginal farmers having land less than 12 acres (Todaro, 1997). Due to insurgencies and the continuous attacks by the militants in the region since 2005, Government of Pakistan estimates that the total loss to agriculture is about thirty-five billion US dollars (Ali, 2010).====The realization of the consequences of terrorism is still limited and studies being done are thematically much skewed. As the potential economic consequences of terrorism are high so it can be explored by conducting studies in terrorism-prone regions/countries. As far as military operation induced by terrorism is concerned, it has negative impacts (i.e. it reduces the income of households, destroyed local infrastructure and forces residents to displace from their homes) in short run while in long run it has positive impacts (i.e. it creates a peace in terrorism affected region and increase the income of household). Hence, it is important to know the impact of military operation induced by terrorism on the income of residents. Although, many researchers estimated the impact of terrorism and military operation at the macro level and found its effects and consequences on the economy but no study has estimated the impact of terrorism and military operations at the micro level. This study is conducted at the micro level and estimated the impact of military operation induced by terrorism on farmer’s income in South and North Waziristan Agencies. These Agencies have homogenous climate, traditions and agricultural aspects but North Waziristan Agency was facing war on terrorism while there was no war on terrorism in South Waziristan Agency. Further, agriculture is the main source of income in both agencies and farming is the major activity carried out by the people.====The overall objective of this study is to empirically investigate the impact of military operation induced by terrorism on the income of farmers in Waziristan Agency. However, the specific objectives of the study are to find out the impact of social and economic characteristics of farmers on their farm income in the presence of military operation induced by terrorism and to suggest appropriate policies for the farmers of South and North Waziristan Agencies to increase their farm income.","Terrorism, military operations and farmer’s income in Waziristan (Pakistan)",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300055,7 March 2019,2019,Research Article,314.0

It aims to contribute to the design of tax reform strategies in emerging and developing economies using Morocco==== as a case study. It builds a reliable model for policy makers to assess tax reforms and their distributional==== /welfare effects by using a number of yardsticks. This includes: (==== enhancing tax revenues which helps create fiscal space for investment and social spending; (==== boosting growth through tax incentives to entrepreneurship and investment; and (==== increasing fairness and welfare, by making the tax system progressive. The dynamic general equilibrium model is adapted to emerging and developing market economies’ specifications and could capture all key dimensions mentioned above in the short, medium==== and long run, as well as potential changes to social spending.====Our keys conclusions from the model simulation and welfare analysis are: first, tax reforms should be part of a comprehensive and well explained approach. Such an approach should consider the combined impact of various tax measures in several dimensions, including growth, revenue, and fairness, as well as parallel efforts to improve the targeting and impact of public social spending. In the absence of comprehensive strategy, the risks are that isolated reforms are not sequenced properly, that they either introduce inconsistencies or distortions, or that they be perceived as unfair, and in the end counter-productive from the perspective of improving the quality, efficiency, fairness, and acceptance of the tax system. Second, a comprehensive tax reform package for Morocco could include: removing tax exemptions on large agricultural firms, simplifying the value-added tax (VAT) regime and corporate taxation, better enforcing tax payments from self-employed and liberal professions, applying property taxes and strengthening social safety net plans. This reform package helps broaden the tax base, remove tax distortions, and better distributes the tax burden.====Our research is related to various papers that assess the macroeconomic and distributional effects of fundamental tax reforms (Altig et al., 2001) and the impacts of major reforms in low-income developing economies (Fabrizio et al., 2017; Furceri, Loungani, Simon, and Wachter, 2016). Our paper contributes to the literature by adding new features, specifically the real estate and rental market, property tax, the ability of assessing a mixed tax reform package, evaluating the impact of informality and the possibility of tracing different social aid plans. Our model draws from the neoclassical approach and is augmented by capital and housing frictions. The sectors which form the economy are households, firms and government. The household sector is heterogeneous by four agents: (==== rural workers who work on land and produce food; (==== informal workers who produce services and rent houses; (==== formal workers who own a portion of housing market and produce goods and services using capital, and (==== entrepreneurs who rent houses to informal workers, manage the production of food, goods and services in firms where rural and formal workers are employed. The government collects taxes and carries out a redistributive role through public spending and lump-sum transfers to households. It could finance its deficit by issuing interest-bearing bonds.====The application of the model to Morocco shows that a comprehensive tax reform implementation could help the government to achieve medium-term objectives such as lower public debt (below ==== of GDP) and higher and more inclusive growth. Implementing a comprehensive tax reform could yield about 1–2==== of additional public revenues over the medium term, creating more fiscal space to support pro-growth and pro-poor spending. Moreover, the reform simplifies the tax system, improves fairness, and better targets transfers. It has a positive effect on output as investors direct resources to high-yield investments, as opposed to lower yield sector such as real estate. The paper simulates the behavior of key macroeconomic variables after applying simple or mix reforms in short and long-run. The short-run effect is mostly neglected in the literature, but in the context of developing economies, it might be as important as the long-term impacts.====The relationship between taxation and economic growth is mixed and differs across countries; in advanced economies, a tax rate increase may dampen growth, while in developing economies, the empirical relationship remains inconclusive. As to how taxation can help reduce inequality, the findings are also conflicting==== ; reducing inequality supports sustainable economic growth but redistributions through tax policy could significantly increase tax burdens. For developing economies, where the body of empirical evidence is smaller, the relationship between tax and inequality seems inconclusive. These findings have in part been attributed to the role of other factors, such as weaker tax administration and enforcement (Acosta Ormaechea & Yoo, 2012). Our paper establishes that strengthening social safety nets is a key to mitigate the effects of tax reform on welfare and inequality. Alongside Emran and Stiglitz (2005), our paper shows that raising government revenue by increasing VATs without further reforms in social safety net plans results in welfare loss. Our paper features generalized and targeted transfers and suggests that designing a tax policy needs a balance between growth and redistribution objectives.====Our paper indicates that the tax mix has implications for existing gender biases and for the efficiency of tax administration. Income and consumption taxes can be gender-biased because of differences between men and women in employment and expenditure (Grown & Valodia, 2010). The aforementioned tax reform reduces unfair cost advantages enjoyed by the informal sector. This makes tax administration simpler and stronger (Fjeldstad, 2014), but has a gender dimension as men and women in the labor force are not equally employed across sectors. More women may participate in the agricultural and informal sectors for example.====We base our conceptualization of informal markets==== on the standard informality literature. Ahmed, Ahmed, Khan, Pasha, and Rehman (2012) and Ahmed, Rehman, and Malik (2013) develop and estimate a closed economy, using Pakistan data, in which informal sector uses labor to produce services. We include this structure in our model. The results indicate that the impact of decreasing the level of informality (by motivating informal sector to declare incomes) on growth and fiscal stance, considering related costs and difficulties, is not significant. Due to a big share of informal sector, tax on informal sector is suboptimal for the economy and has a negligible distributional effects on wages.====Tax reform could address economic distortions thereby unlock additional growth. For Morocco, Karim and Mansouri (2015) shows that tax reform could decrease distortions in agriculture through an efficient allocation of investments. Verme and El-Massnaoui (2015) evaluates the 2014 subsidy reforms in Morocco by simulating the impact of reforms on household welfare, poverty, and the government budget. Our paper confirms the literature and shows appealing exemptions boost output by decreasing distortions and making the economy efficient.====Finally, the housing market and its impact on welfare in developing countries are mostly neglected in the literature and Acosta Ormaechea and Yoo, 2012). However, for instance in Morocco, over ==== of the urban population lives in rental housing (2007 household survey, HCP====). This shows the significance of the housing market for both home owners and renters. To fill this gap, our paper evaluates the impact of taxes on the rental and property markets. This paper suggests that in the current situation==== of Morocco, property taxes not only proceed the progressivity, but also boost output by making the tax system broad-based and growth-friendly.====The paper will rely on a few complementary analytical approaches, and is structured as follows: Section 2 presents key stylized features of Morocco’s economy and tax system, including a cross-country perspective; Section 3 develops a macrostructural dynamic general equilibrium model that incorporates developing countries’ specific features. Section 4 calibrates the model based on Moroccan data. In Section 5, results of permanent changes in various tax codes and different scenarios alongside policy issues are examined.

This model considers all the radial and non-radial slacks associated with good outputs as well as the undesirable outcomes while estimating inefficiency and helps to identify the source of the inefficiency. The empirical results based on a sample of 46 regional public hospitals from 2006–07 to 2013–14 show on average overall inefficiency of 24% and much of these are due to inefficiencies associated with undesirable outcome of stillbirths and intra-uterine deaths. Further, on an average the sampled hospitals have experienced marginal productivity decline over the reform period. The study indicates that there is a greater scope for efficiency and productivity gains in public hospitals, particularly if the undesirable outcome of still birth is minimized.","Ongoing health reforms in India have put tremendous pressure on public hospitals to improve their operational efficiency, as well as health outcomes, particularly in the delivery of Emergency and Neonatal obstetric care (EmONC)==== services. This paper investigates the efficiency and productivity improvements in the presence of undesirable outcomes in EmONC settings in a sample of regional public hospitals from India.====From policy perspective in general, improving public health system efficiencies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have the potential to expand fiscal space and serve as an additional source of healthcare financing (Chisholm & Evans, 2010). Specifically, strengthening of EmONC services at the first referral units(FRUs) or secondary hospitals have implications for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality in low resource settings (Starrs, 2006; UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA & AMDD, 2009; Otolorin, Gomez, Currie, Thapa, & Dao, 2015; Campbell et al., 2016). These secondary public hospitals by providing appropriate support enhance the effectiveness of primary care services. Besides, referrals from the lower level to higher tertiary institutions contribute to gaps and delays in the provision of emergency obstetric care due to the absence of clinical guidelines, inadequate referral communication and low compliance (Singh, Doyle, Campbell, Mathew, & Murthy, 2016). Hence, improving the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the EmONC facilities in the secondary hospitals is crucial for improving the obstetric and neonatal health outcomes.====Existing studies in the domain are district-wide assessments of the EmONC performance in the public facilities. Most studies are based on cross-sectional surveys of facility infrastructure, available services, equipment and supplies. These studies provide a static view of supply side gaps and constraints such as (i) shortages and poor retention of skilled personnel, especially in the rural areas; (ii) lack of training among health personnel; (iii) poor attitude and motivation of health personnel; (iv) lack of emergency equipment, frequent repair and lack of maintenance; (v) non-functional operating theatre; and (vi) lack of drugs and blood facilities; drug shortages due to economic and management issues (Al Serouri, Al Rabee, Bin Afif, & Al Rukeimi, 2009; Cham, Sundby, & Vangen, 2009; Freedman et al., 2007; Gao & Barclay, 2010; Miltenburg, Kiritta, Bishanga, van Roosmalen, & Stekelenburg, 2017; Olsen, Ndek, & Norheim, 2004; Paxton, Bailey, Lobis, & Fry, 2006). Empirical studies from the Indian context also confirm such supply side issues in the EmONC settings (Biswas et al., 2005; Mavalankar, Raman, Dwivedi, & Jain, 2004; Mony et al., 2013). Such studies are situation analysis at a given point of time and are descriptive in nature. There are not many longitudinal studies on the efficiency and productivity of EmONC facilities in the Indian context. Previous studies measuring the efficiency of public facilities from India (Bhat, Verma, & Ruben, 2001; Mathiyazhgan, 2006; Dash, Vaishnavi, & Muraleedharan, 2010; Rajasulochana & Dash, 2012; Jat & Sebastian, 2013) are largely based on cross-sectional data using classical Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. Most of these studies have not accounted for adverse outcomes, except for one recent paper by Rajasulochana and Matranga (2018). This empirical paper tries to build this existing line of literature through modelling efficiency and productivity changes in the presence of undesirable outcomes in the EmONC settings over time.====The paper is organized as follows.

However, carbon tax, as a means of taxation, inevitably imposes an additional burden on the economic entity and, thus, could have a negative impact on the overall economy. The potential adverse effects of carbon tax may explain why it has only been implemented in limited regions (such as Nordic countries and British Columbia). Many studies have been carried out to analyze the impacts of carbon tax, including the socioeconomic impacts (Chen & Nie, 2016; Freire-González, 2018; Guo, Zhang, Zheng, & Rao, 2014; Kemfert & Welsch, 2000; Wissema & Dellink, 2007), the distributional effects (Callan, Lyons, Scott, Tol, & Verde, 2009; Dong & Whalley, 2012; Feng et al., 2010; Gonzalez, 2012; Jiang & Shao, 2014; Liang & Wei, 2012), and the competitiveness effects (Liang, Fan, & Wei, 2007a; Lu, Tong, & Liu, 2010; Wang, Hubacek, Feng, Wei, & Liang, 2016; Wang, Li, & Zhang, 2011).====Most of the related studies up to now have focused on the overall economic level of a nation. Extending the vision to sub-national and/or multi-regional level can provide more informative implications. Regional differences are the root causes of the debate about accounting principles to identify regional emission responsibilities, which is essential to the efficiency and fairness of any mitigation policy, including a carbon tax. Analyzing the provincial effects of carbon tax is especially important for China, given the pronounced regional disparity between the well-developed eastern provinces and the less-developed central and western provinces (Kemfert & Welsch, 2000). Due to the differences in resource endowments and economic development level among China’s provinces, there is a significant difference in provincial energy consumption and carbon emissions (Liang, Fan, & Wei, 2007b; Liu, Wang, Wu, & Wei, 2010). For example, He and Li (2010) applied a 2007 multi-regional computable general equilibrium model of China to study the impacts of carbon tax on regional economy and found that a uniform carbon tax would widen the regional disparity in terms of welfare. Moreover, China currently emphasizes the coordinated development of various regions and formulates corresponding regional development strategies (such as “West Development” and “Northeast Area Revitalization Plan”), which further increase the complexity of allocating emission reduction responsibilities among regions (Dong & Whalley, 2012).====A few studies have also focused on the competitiveness effects of carbon tax in China. Wang et al. (2011) analyzed the competitiveness effects of carbon tax based on the 2007 Chinese national input–output table. Their results shows that a high level of carbon tax may require compensatory measures to address the competitiveness losses. Pan (2015) investigated the impacts of carbon tax on the sectoral competitiveness based on the 2007 Chinese multi-regional input–output table, with 8 regions and 17 sectors from both the production-based and consumption – carbon emissions’ accounting. They found that the consumption-based principle could reduce the burdens of both the Northwest and the Northeast. Existing research has either focused on the big region or has been carried out at the national level, whereas, in this study, we focus on all 30 Chinese provinces in Mainland China. In addition, this study also assesses the impacts of carbon tax against different tax revenue recycling scenarios. This study intends to focus on the short-term effects, as the uncertainty of long-term impacts is high, and governments usually put more emphasis on the short-run effects when considering whether to impose a carbon tax (Pan, 2015). For instance, the central and local governments will be particularly concerned about whether mitigation policies will jeopardize the short-term social and economic development goals (e.g., the five-year plans). To this end, among the major methods used in existing researches, the input–output model was adopted to focus this study on short-term effects.====Based on the most recent 2012 multi-regional input–output table for China, with 30 provinces and 30 sectors, this study analyzes the impacts of a carbon tax on different Chinese provinces based on different schemes of tax revenue recycling and under two main emission accounting principles. To be specific, three scenarios of recycling carbon tax revenue have been established to maintain tax neutrality. These are using the revenue to reduce sectoral production tax, as a lump-sum transfer to households, or as a lump-sum transfer to low income households. The two main principles are production-based accounting, which was used by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol (Peters, 2008; Steininger et al., 2014), and consumption-based accounting, which is currently popular for embodied carbon emission researches (Feng, Hubacek, Sun, & Liu, 2014; Liu, Liang, & Wang, 2015; Mi et al., 2016; Peters, 2008; Wiedmann, 2009; Zhang, 2015).",The economic effects of carbon tax on China’s provinces,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300195,5 March 2019,2019,Research Article,317.0

Central banks, including the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB), were forced to act, initially injecting huge amounts of liquidity into the banking system and later reducing the interest rates to historical lows (Fig. 1). When interest rates hit the zero lower bound, central banks initiated a considerable monetary expansion.====Fig. 2 shows how the monetary base was affected by those expansive measures and Fig. 3 displays the total assets of the balance sheet of the Fed and of the ECB relative to GDP in order to appreciate the size of the expansion by relating it to the real economy. Before the crisis, the monetary base in USA changed slowly, however, after the eruption of the crisis, the Fed systematically increased the size of its balance sheet by introducing liquidity programs and quantitative easing, which involved the purchase of agency bonds, Mortgage-Backed Securities, and long-term Treasury bonds. As a result, the balance sheet of the Fed increased from 6% to nearly 30% of GDP.====The rate of expansion of the balance sheet of the ECB has been less constant than that of the Fed. After the introduction of the new procedure for auctions, the ====, an increase of the size of the ECB balance sheet to GDP could be observed and was then held approximately constant. However, at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012, the most important change in the monetary base and in the total assets took place through the auctions of the Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) maturing in 3 years. Those operations vastly increased the liquidity and the size of the balance sheet, which amounted to more than 30% of GDP. It was a temporary increase however; after 2013, the balance sheet started to diminish due to the repayment of these loans by the financial entities, and finally it returned to 20% of GDP.====In effect, the increase of the balance sheet of the ECB was temporary and dependent on the decisions regarding the repayment of the loans made by banks, whereas the increase of the balance sheet of the Fed was permanent or at least remained until there was an explicit change in monetary policy. This particular way of expanding the monetary base forced banks to lend to families and firms with a smaller maturity than the financing received through the ECB, and could therefore have led to a reduced effectiveness of the monetary expansion on the real economy.====During the crisis, in the US, research has focused on studying the very short-term effects of the Federal Reserve monetary policy measures on financial indicators (Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, & Sack, 2011; Krishnamurthy & Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011; Wright, 2012, among others), while in the Eurozone, researchers have sought to determine whether the ECB measures increased the volume of loans (Lenza, Pill, & Reichlin, 2010; Peersman, 2011, among others). However, no study in the literature compares the effectiveness of the transmission channels before and after the start of the crisis.====This work studies the transmission of monetary policy in the United States and the Eurozone in order to discover whether the transmission channels have changed with the arrival of the financial crisis and with the application of unconventional measures by its monetary authorities. In the first place, we study the relative importance of the various transmission channels for the conventional monetary policy during the period previous to the financial crisis and for the unconventional policy after the latter had begun, both for a permanent expansion of the balance sheet, as in the case of the Fed, and for a transitory expansion, as in the case of the ECB.====A great number of monetary policy transmission channels have been identified (Boivin, Kiley, & Mishkin, 2010), of which we focus on two: the risk-taking channel or simply the ====, that is, expansive monetary policy provides an incentive for risk-taking of the agents (Altunbas, Gambacorta, & Marques-Ibanez, 2014), whose study has grown in importance after the crisis began, and the ====, which indicates the special role of the banks in lending to families and firms (Bernanke & Gertler, 1995; Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, & Saurina, 2012).====By using a VAR model, we conclude that both conventional and unconventional monetary policy in the United States stimulated economic growth, with the risk channel as the most important factor. In the Eurozone, conventional monetary policy was effective and was transmitted fundamentally through the credit channel, but the expansion of the balance sheet after the start of the crisis was only effective at the beginning of the crisis. Moreover, it was transmitted paradoxically through the risk channel, despite the fact that the mechanism employed for said expansion was in terms of the injection of liquidity into the banking system and not via the purchase of assets in the financial markets destined to reduce the spread of risk.====This work is structured as follows. The following section shows a sample of the empirical literature regarding the effects of monetary policy. The third section contains the methodology.

By utilizing ====, the study reveals whether the government expenditures are a significant factor in economic growth in short-term perspective. Finally, IRF and FEVD tests are applied to estimate the effects of a change in particular government expenditures on GDP for twelve year time horizon. This study validates the hypothesis that, irrespective of size and nature of the economy (Armenia vs. Spain), some public expenditures (e.g. healthcare) positively contribute to the growth of the economy, while social protection in both countries is negatively related to GDP.","The discussion of the role of public expenditures on economic growth has a long history and it is still an extensive topic of discussion for public economists and policymakers. Economic thought on the macroeconomic effect of public expenditures is widely divided. On the one hand, there is the notion that the government activity by means of government spending increases as a result of economic growth with a long-term trend proposed by Wagner in the late nineteenth century (Wagner, 1890). This notion, known as Wagner’s law, summarizes that government growth is due to a growing demand for public goods and control of externalities, therefore causality runs from the national income to the government spending. On the other hand, in the Keynesian short-term perspective, an active fiscal policy, such as increased government spending, has impact on demand and leads, in turn, through the multiplier and accelerator effects to the improved income or economic activity in a country. Wagner’s rule argues that public expenditures are an endogenous factor or an outcome and not a cause of growth in national income. Whereas, Keynes’ hypothesis considers government spending as an exogenous policy instrument that can affect economic growth. Frequently, in order to evaluate these theories, Granger causality tests are used as an empirical tool, which, in turn, may detect unidirectional or bidirectional causalities from public expenditures to national income (or vice versa) (Claus, Martinez-Vazquez, & Vulovic, 2012; Kolluri, Panik, & Wahab, 2000; Martínez-Vazquez, Vulovic, & Moreno Dodson, 2012).====Thus, the emphasis on the importance of institutions to economic prosperity goes back at least to the ==== Adam Smith (1776) and has been found in the more recent works of Solow (1956); Barro (1990); Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) and others. The extent of government participation is one of the most fascinating topics in social science and economists have chosen different methods to analyze this phenomenon through well-defined economic models mainly derived from the theories introduced by Solow. For another approach, take Gwartney, Lawson, and Norton, (2008) who quantify the level of economic freedom on a scale from 0 to 10. They use the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) index which rates the degree at which policies and institutions of a country are supportive of the economic freedom. The authors of the EFW annual index analyze forty-two variables that attribute to five main qualifiers: (1) size of government, (2) legal structure and security of property rights, (3) access to sound money, (4) freedom to trade internationally, and (5) regulation of credit, labor and business. The study uses data from 102 nations and the countries are grouped into quintiles. The study reveals a strong correlation between the high EFW index and economic growth. Thereby, the countries in the top quartile of the EFW index (the average EFW score is 6.65 out of 10 (2008 report)) enjoy more sound economic growth in comparison with those in the bottom quartile (Gwartney et al., 2008).====The impact of appropriate fiscal adjustments on long-term sustainable growth is a central topic in many economic studies. Thus, Alesina, Perotti, Tavares, Obstfeld, and Eichengreen, (1998) and von Hagen, Hallet, and Strauch, (2001) focus on industrial countries and conclude that higher and more sustainable long-term growth can be achieved through increasing public wages and transfers, rather than through higher government revenues and lower public investments. While Gupta, Clements, Baldacci, and Mulas-Granados, (2005) in their study of thirty-nine low income countries estimate that the fiscal consolidation was not harmful for growth in the period from 1990 to 2005. They estimate that the countries with a large share of expenditures in public wages tend to have lower growth, while the countries with investments in capital and non-wage goods and services experience more rapid growth in national income.====Ortiz and Cummins (2013) focus on public expenditures and the effect of fiscal adjustment measured in 181 countries. Their research covers four specific periods: 2005–2007 (pre-crisis), 2008–2009 (crisis phase I: fiscal extension), 2010–2012 (onset of fiscal contraction) and 2013–2015 (crisis phase III: intensification of fiscal contraction). The research finds that contractions are most severe in the developing world and they mainly affect vulnerable groups of population in almost one hundred countries. The public expenditure cuts mainly target subsidies, wage bills of public workers, safety net programs, pension reforms and increase consumption taxes (such as VAT). Clements, Faircloth, and Verhoeven, (2007) in their study suggest that, while the renewed political systems tend to decrease state intervention, a wide range of social rights and effective enforcement mechanisms is enshrined in government regulations, demanding a significant increase in current government spending, especially in social spending.====The aim of this paper is to determine which public expenditures have a significant effect on economic growth, and conversely, and the study addresses two very different countries: Armenia and Spain. These sample countries are chosen for determining if there are any similarities in the causal effect of particular public expenditures on the national growth for unalike (in size, shape and level of development) economies and through the perspective of two theories considered: Wagner’s law and Keynes’ hypothesis. Economic literature provides evidence that VAR tests are usually applied to studies of single country data to determine causal relations of public spending and economic growth. The differences between the sample countries are in the history, structure and the level of economic development, geographic location, focus of targeted government programs and level of public expenditures. The novelty of this study is twofold. First, the analysis lies on a new perspective of comparison of two countries representing two different economic unions: Armenia being a member of the Eurasian Economic Union and Spain being a member of the European Union. Second, the analysis of the relationship between economic growth and government spending is made by its components, i.e., following the functional disaggregation of the government spending in each country, according to the literature.====This comparative analysis of public finance management of an EAEU and an EU country gains additional importance in light of the signed The EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) that puts forward the assessment and implementation of the government regulations beneficial for investment and economic activities of the signed stakeholders (European Commission, 2017). This agreement can be viewed as an experiment demonstrating possibility of a balanced economic partnership of an EAEU member country in the EU developments.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers a brief review of the literature. Section 3 discusses the data used in the study. Section 4 introduces the empirical model for the analysis. The results are presented in Section 5.

The first refers to the appropriability of basic research: if technology is a quasi-public good, then the incentive to invest will be low, because each firm will try to take advantage of the innovative efforts made by others. The second element influencing R&D investments relates to capital market imperfections. The risk involved in research leads investors to increase the cost of financing innovation and, as a consequence, tends to reduce the amount of research conducted by firms. The final outcome is a level of private R&D that is lower than the desired aggregate level (Arrow, 1962).====These considerations help the understanding of state intervention in favour of innovation. Any policy aims to compensate for the difference between social and private returns on R&D efforts and ensures financial facilities for innovators, particularly in the first stage of the innovation process. While the initial objective of an R&D policy is to increase the amount of innovation, the final scope is to strengthen the position of each country among the leading knowledge- and competence-based countries. This is basically the mission of many R&D programmes, for example the Europe 2020 agenda, which is part of the EU’s growth strategy to promote a more competitive economy in the coming years.====Determining whether, and to what extent, the objectives of R&D programmes have been achieved is crucial in any policy evaluation debate. Indeed, if, on one hand, governments increasingly recognize the benefits of supporting R&D investments, on the other hand, public resources are scarce, especially in times of sovereign and financial crisis (Becker, 2015). In this regard, a number of scholars assess whether R&D incentives have additional effects on firms’ ====, such as the investments in R&D, tangible assets or skilled employment. This literature is huge and is reviewed by David, Hall, and Toole (2000), Klette, Møen, and Griliches (2000), Zúñiga-Vicente, Alonso-Borrego, Forcadell, and Galàn (2014) and Becker (2015). Conversely, studies of the impact of subsidies on firms’ ==== are relatively scant (see e.g. Bérubé & Mohnen, 2009; Branstetter & Sakakibara, 2002; Bronzini & Piselli, 2016; Moretti & Wilson, 2014), thereby leaving room for further research.====The policy question driving this paper is the evaluation of the ultimate impact of public support on firm R&D activity. It is true that roughly the same question is raised in many papers, but a great deal of empirical work seems not to provide policy makers with clear guidance for at least two main reasons. First, many studies provide mixed results and some systematic reviews just list the major results without providing a conclusive ranking of the R&D policy instruments (Becker, 2015; David et al., 2000). Moreover, some still report ex post analyses rather than well-designed “quasi-experiments”, of which the outcome variable can be the result of other extra-policy effects or a mix of more than one policy. Here, the result crucially depends on the ability of the econometrician to impose enough good statistical controls, which varies widely by study (David et al., 2000). It is noteworthy that many recent empirical studies are set out according to the most accurate and modern approach of quasi-experimental methods but are distributed over a very heterogeneous set of small, context-specific firms (firms applying for a specific policy intervention within a specific sector, research or geographical area). This introduces heterogeneity into the results even if the target variable of the evaluation study remains the same (R&D activity, kind of innovation; see Zúñiga-Vicente et al., 2014).====Another open issue is how the nature of the incentives might influence their effects.==== Compared with subsidies, which are usually granted after selective procedures, automatic incentives (tax credits or other forms of fiscal incentives) present the advantages of simple implementation and low administrative costs. Additionally, the reduction of the tax burden (usually proportional to the volume of firm R&D activity) depends on and may be bounded by the actual amount of the firms’ tax liabilities. In this respect, the instrument is less suitable for financing start-up, young or unprofitable firms that might not have enough tax liabilities to take credit advantages (Busom, Corchuelo, & Martìnez-Ros, 2014). Grants might also be preferable for firms that have worse access to capital markets, because, unlike tax incentives, firms cannot finance their projects in advance. Finally, fiscal incentives tend to induce smaller allocative distortions than subsidies, because they are more neutral in terms of the projects being backed; on the other hand, they represent an instrument that is less suitable for influencing the kind of R&D activity realized by the target firms.====This paper addresses the above issues. By referring to a unique large sample of SME firms, which is highly representative of the Italian manufacturing sector, we provide results with greater general (external) validity. At the same time, thanks to the information contained in the detailed survey questionnaire, we can directly compare the effectiveness of different policy instruments (tax credits versus research-specific subsidies). More generally, since the main goal of most programmes supporting R&D activity is to increase innovation and knowledge, this study contributes to this stream of research by evaluating the effect of public support not only on R&D activity itself but also on firms’ innovation outcome measured by patent applications. In this respect, the study evaluates the effect of publicly funded R&D on the probability of applying for a patent and on the number of patent applications of recipient firms.====The main results are as follows. There is a strong additionality effect of public support on firm R&D investments, in line with much of the literature. However, we show that the increase in inputs does not lead to a higher innovative output. Thus, by combining the results on patent applications and R&D expenditure, we show that the return of R&D efforts in terms of patenting is significantly lower for publicly funded expenditure. Finally, when we compare the effect by type of incentive, subsidies push R&D expenditure more than tax credits but at the cost of decreasing R&D returns in generating patents.====The rest of the study is organised into another six sections. The next section points out the theoretical background and the empirical literature. Section 3 provides some arguments for the use of patents as a measure of innovation, while Section 4 briefly presents the data set. The empirical strategy is described in Section 5 and the results in Section 6. Concluding remarks make up the final section.",Good value for public money?

For such a rational agent a minimum eligibility retirement age (MERA) is irrelevant unless it is binding, i.e. she would prefer a different career duration if it were allowed. Imposing more years of labor market activity (extensive margin) can lead to a decrease in instantaneous labor supply (intensive margin). Overall life-time labor supply could remain essentially unaffected by the change in the de iure MERA if it is aligned with individual preferences (see Boersch-Supan, 2013). Despite these insights from the theory, data demonstrate that with few exceptions, the de facto labor market exit age is substantially lower than MERA in all advanced economies (Heijdra & Romp, 2009; Sauré & Zoabi, 2012). This puzzle underlies the relevance of the debate over MERA (Gruber & Wise, 2007).====Raising de iure MERA is and most likely will continue to be a politically sensitive issue (see Feldstein, 2016). Intuitively, working longer is detrimental to welfare when individuals have disutility from labor, a standard assumption in most economic models. Yet, with increasing longevity, the old-age dependency ratio is expected to deteriorate, which is further amplified by decreasing fertility. These observed demographic trends increase interest in policies aimed at raising the overall participation, including labor market activity of the elderly (see Boersch-Supan & Ludwig, 2010; Fehr, 2000). In addition to mitigating the negative consequences of a shrinking working population, unlike other considered policy options, these policies can mitigate the detrimental effects of longevity on the stability of pension systems (Fehr, Jokisch, & Kotlikoff, 2008).====One of the main arguments raised in discussions over MERA relies on incentives: if a pension system provides incentives to prolong the period of labor market activity in the light of longer life expectancy with increasing exit age, agents may fully internalize the general equilibrium benefits from longer employment duration. From the welfare perspective (in a representative agent setting), it is irrelevant if the exit age is endogenous or exogenous: exogenous non-binding constraints will not affect choices, excessive exogenous constraint will only limit access to pension benefits but will not prolong labor market activity. Clearly, defined contribution (DC) system seems to provide stronger incentives, because agents see the link between work and pension benefits, and internalize it. The opposite holds for a defined benefit (DB) system, where private incentives are weak. In fact, in a DB system, most of the welfare consequences come from general equilibrium effects (in a DB system, higher MERA reduces the fiscal burden, allowing for reduced taxation, ceteris paribus). Moreover, there are partial equilibrium effects, which stem from the fact that in most standard economic setups agents prefer smoother life-cycle paths, hence the preference for longer working periods.====In this paper we develop a series of overlapping generations models to determine the welfare effects of increasing the retirement age. We employ demographic projections to obtain a realistic scenario of longevity and impose a commensurate increase in minimum eligibility age to start collecting pensions (see Fehr, 2016). We analyze two cases. In the first, an economy has a defined benefit pay-as-you-go system (DB PAYG). In the second case, a reform is implemented from a PAYG DB to a DC system financed at a pay-as-you-go basis (often referred to as notionally defined contribution, NDC). In both cases, the baseline scenario is characterized by unchanged MERA, despite demographic changes. In the reform scenario, MERA is increased in line with longevity, i.e. by as much as 15%. We analyze the welfare and the macroeconomic effects of such policy change.====In addition to being policy relevant, this question is also empirically intriguing. First, it is not clear if the benefits of a higher MERA are going to be outweighed by the disutility of working longer under alternative pension systems. Second, there are no clear theoretical underpinnings regarding the comparison of the size of the welfare effects across the pension systems. Third, we compare the size of the welfare effects from changing the retirement age (i.e. one of the examples of the parametric reforms) to the welfare effects from reforming the pension system from DB to DC scheme (i.e. systemic reforms). In comparing these welfare effects, our findings are particularly useful for countries yet to implement any reforms.====We find that the welfare effects of increasing MERA are similar across both analyzed pension systems, even if they stem from different sources. The net consumption equivalent from the implementation of this reform equals around 4% of the life-time consumption. We decompose this overall welfare gain into partial and general equilibrium effects. The former allows us to quantify the value of labor supply smoothing over life-cycle. The latter is informative of the welfare effects from improved fiscal balance and prices. We show that, initially, general equilibrium effects dominate. As the economy transits to the new steady state and prices adjust, the role of partial equilibrium effects strengthens to eventually dominate.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses briefly the relevant literature. A theoretical model is presented in Section 3, while Section 4 describes in detail calibration and analyzed scenarios. We present the results and various sensitivity checks in Section====5. We conclude by discussing the results in light of the political economy mechanisms that may be at play in the context of such reforms.",On welfare effects of increasing retirement age,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300158,2 March 2019,2019,Research Article,321.0

Different possible scenarios of the future reforms of the CAP are currently being discussed. They vary in terms of the extent and the type of the intervention and consequently the welfare effects for different social groups. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the partial equilibrium model (CAPRI) and the Theory of Moves (TOM) can be jointly used to test socio-political acceptance of the CAP’s reforms, informing subsequent changes to the policy. Our exemplary results demonstrate that liquidation of the first pillar of the CAP would negatively influence the socio-political acceptance of the CAP.","The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU is one of the oldest European policies. It is characterized by large and diversified groups of beneficiaries, diversity of objectives, multi-level decision-making and an important budget. Because of these features it is an interesting research area for public choice theory, defined by Mueller (1993) as ‘the formal modeling of the self-interested behavior of rational individuals in a political environment’.====For over a quarter of a century after its establishment, the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU remained largely unchanged. It provided protection for the EU agriculture against world market fluctuations and support of farm incomes through high product prices. As a result, the EU was facing long-standing problems relating to overproduction and escalating budgetary costs. Replacing price intervention with a system of direct payments to farmers and extending structural rural development programs (the so-called second pillar of the CAP) made the policy more market oriented. However, it did not radically reduce its cost. The CAP still accounts for about 40% of the total EU budget, out of which 74% supports direct payments and market intervention (the so-called first pillar of the CAP). Moreover, agricultural guarantee spending is the main element of compulsory expenditure of the EU budget.====Many observers assume that agricultural subsidies have largely been a consequence of lobbying organized by the beneficiaries (Botterill, 2005; Clark & Jones, 1999; Furtom, Sauer, & Skovager Jensen, 2009; Jonsson, 2007; Nedergaard, 2006). On the other hand, some economists believe that support of the agricultural sector is relevant for its proper functioning. They argue that agricultural markets are far from being competitive and as such, agriculture is different from other forms of economic activity. Compared to other sectors of the economy Botterill (2004) identifies these main differences as: inelastic demand for food, as well as climatic uncertainty of agricultural production (mainly crop production) which causes fluctuation in the price of agricultural products and farm incomes resulting in a lack of general economic growth. Furthermore, an important objective of the intervention in agriculture is food security on the national and global level (Koehler, 2015). Recently, the CAP has been justified by the concept of agricultural multifunctionality, which argues that agriculture does not merely provide tradable commodities, but also produces a number of positive externalities and collective goods (jobs, culture, landscape, environment, etc.), that need to be publicly supported (Fouilleux, 2004). This concept reflects both the capacity of agriculture to produce a wide range of goods and services and the existence of a social demand for them, particularly due to the public good character of some of them (OECD, 2000). It guarantees sufficient provision of the public goods supplied by agriculture in the social, environmental and production fields (Gómez-Limón & Atance, 2004).====The disagreement concerning the justification of the intervention, as well as its type and extent, is intensified by the varying interests of different social groups and limited information on possible effects of the CAP’s reforms for its stakeholders. Meanwhile, the understanding and the acceptance of the policy by its stakeholders is considered a necessary condition for success in agenda-setting, policy formulation or implementation (Ingold, 2011; Kriesi & Jegen, 2001; Simantov, 1973) and for impacting policy change (Dermont, Ingold, Kammermann, & Stadelmann-Steffen, 2017).====Policy acceptance is crucial for policies that deal with natural resources, including agricultural policy. Simantov (1973) suggests that “all citizens should be concerned with such a vital part of economic policy and should contribute to setting priorities which reflect present problems”. Moreover, it should be clearly acknowledged what groups of actors benefit from an instrument and pay for its implementation. Wüstenhagen et al. (2007) distinguish three dimensions of social acceptance, namely: socio-political acceptance, community acceptance and market acceptance. In this paper we refer to socio-political acceptance, which ‘concerns the acceptance by key stakeholders and policy actors’. Although the term acceptance generally implies agreement (Batel, Devine-Wright, & Tangeland, 2013), there is a lack of consensus on how acceptance is defined and measured (Batel et al., 2013; Dermont et al., 2017; Fournis & Fortin, 2017). Ellis and Ferraro (2017) emphasize that the definitions of social acceptance made in the literature vary from those based on lack of effective opposition to a project to these connected to a Pareto optimality.====Cohen, Reichl, and Schmidthaler (2014) use the welfare approach to measure social acceptance of new infrastructure projects. They assume that social acceptance occurs when the welfare decreasing aspects of a project are balanced by its welfare increasing aspects leaving each agent better off and supportive of the project—or welfare neutral and indifferent to the completion of the project.====We also apply the welfare approach to reflect socio-political acceptance of policy reforms, but we combine it with a notion of game theory equilibrium. We measure the welfare changes of parties, and based on that assess utilities for the non-cooperative game played between main stakeholders of the policy. For this purpose we jointly use two methodological approaches: partial equilibrium model (CAPRI) and Theory of Moves (TOM)—a branch of game theory proposed by Brams (1994a). TOM is based on a classical theory of games, focusing on interdependent strategies in which the outcome depends on the choices that all players make. In contrast to the classical game theory, however, it allows the players to look a few steps forward before deciding on their next move. This demands from the players to foresee the consequences of making their moves and countermoves, and postpones impending conflict analysis. The rules of TOM assume that players, using backward induction, anticipate the changes in the strategies of the other players and alternately change their strategies (make a move in a pay-off table) to reach the so-called non-myopic equilibrium. As Brams (1994a) describes ‘players move precisely because they calculate that they can advance by switching states, anticipating a better outcome when the move-countermove process finally comes to rest’. Because moving leads to better outcomes for the players, the non-myopic equilibrium can be interpreted as negotiation consensus accepted by all the parties of the game. Thus, taking into account that welfare changes of involved parties are reflected in games payoffs, a TOM equilibrium is the most socially accepted among all analyzed states of the game.====The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the partial equilibrium model (CAPRI) and the Theory of Moves (TOM) can be jointly used to test socio-political acceptance of the CAP’s reforms, informing subsequent changes to the policy. As an example, we model the TOM game showing the conflict between stakeholders on the liquidation of the first pillar of the CAP, and verify whether the removal of this pillar would be socially accepted.====The outline of the paper is as follows. First, we describe the methodology. Second, we present a short review of the CAP history and a possible scenario of its further reforms. Third, we model exemplary TOM game. Finally we conclude with a discussion of possible limitations of this approach.",Reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU: Expected results and their social acceptance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300043,1 March 2019,2019,Research Article,323.0

By using a ,"Ireland, once hailed as the Celtic Tiger for its roaring economy since the mid-90 s, has experienced a severe economic crisis and subsequent debt crisis. The question is how the Irish economic miracle ended up in a deep recession and why Ireland is one of the European countries that was hit the hardest. In this context the advent of the euro does not remain undiscussed. The theory of optimum currency areas (Mundell, 1961) indicates a crucial consequence of euro membership, namely the delegation of a sovereign monetary policy to a common central bank. A member of the euro area is necessarily consigned to the one-size-fits-all policy from the European Central Bank (ECB) which only takes euro-area-wide conditions into account. But when economic performance among countries within a currency union diverges significantly, the costs of a common currency, e.g. the Walters effect, can be very high. It is very likely that different euro countries prefer different interest rates. Moons and Van Poeck (2008) show on the basis of a normative Taylor-rule that the monetary policy of the ECB clearly does not fit the needs of all individual euro members. Such inappropriate policy rates can potentially lead to domestic macroeconomic imbalances. Heterogeneity in terms of inflation, economic growth and competitiveness in general, represents a major challenge for the ECB since it has to implement a policy for the euro area as a whole (De Grauwe, 2012; Krugman & Obstfeld, 2009; Wyplosz, 2006). Price dispersions are inevitable, even in a currency area like the US, but it becomes critical when those regional differences are significant and persist over time. As a consequence, monetary policy can have asymmetric real effects and can even strengthen national macro-economic imbalances through the well-known Walters critique. A too low nominal interest rate leads to a decline in real interest rates which further stimulates domestic demand and induces additional pro cyclical inflationary pressure and can for example trigger a property bubble and related dislocations. Conversely, countries with relative low inflation experience an unintended contra-cyclical impact (Busetti, Forni, Harvey, & Vendetti, 2007; Fendel & Frenkel, 2009).====The degree of heterogeneity within the euro zone, with focus on Ireland, is discussed in the following figures. A first dimension to look at is the inflation rate. Fig. 1, which presents a Philips curve, clearly illustrates that between 1997 and 2008 peripheral countries like Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece persistently had an average inflation rate that was far higher than the euro-average. Germany, Finland, Austria, France and Belgium on the contrary, formed a cluster of low inflation countries (Busetti et al., 2007). Between 1997 and 2008, Irish real GDP growth was persistently two to three percent higher than in Germany and the EMU. The correlation between the cumulative growth of real GDP and the cumulative inflation rate is 0.54 which indicates that besides structural factors cyclical or national demand factors played a role in explaining inflation differentials within the euro area (Lane, 2006). Economic cycles clearly aren’t synchronized, especially when comparing Ireland with the core countries. Furthermore, Ireland was the first to be hit by the crisis, in the first quarter of 2008, while the euro area as a whole was hit one year later. Again, this illustrates the non-synchronization of European business cycles.====Despite the differences, the ECB succeeded relatively well in keeping the aggregate inflation close to 2%.==== Between 2000 and 2004 Ireland in particular witnessed a strong rise in inflation and was, with about 4%, twice the euro zone average. The most important explanation for this is the low real interest rate. However exposure to exchange rate volatility, namely the depreciation of the euro against the dollar and the British pound, can explain a significant part of the divergent inflation rates. Given the high degree of openness of the Irish economy and the fact that the percentage of intra-EMU trade in its trade volume is the smallest among all euro countries (Honohan & Lane, 2003), the weakness of the euro in the initial years of the EMU, making exports cheaper and imports more expensive, can partly explain the higher Irish inflation rates compared to the euro average.====Crucial for the further analysis in this paper, is the divergent trends in the evolution of the growth of domestic credit and house prices. Fig. 2 reveals that the yearly average growth rate of nominal credit, provided by the domestic banking sector, and the yearly change in real house prices have a positive correlation of 0.58. It is striking that Ireland and Spain experienced the biggest growth in credit and house prices and were hit the hardest by the recent crisis (De Grauwe, 2010). Besides that it is also noteworthy that the yearly change in real house prices differs significantly across euro countries.====Given the above it is unlikely that the ECB’s monetary policy was tailored to the needs of the small Irish economy. Many authors like De Grauwe (2010); Honohan (2010), and Taylor (2009) therefore postulate that EMU-membership led to very low, inappropriate Irish interest rates and was the main cause of the Irish credit, consumption and property boom and subsequent bust. However, comprehensive and clear econometric evidence for the precise role and impact of monetary policy rates on Irish property prices and related macro-economic imbalances is still lacking. Taylor (2007); Taylor, 2009 shows, using descriptive data, that housing booms in European countries were largest where the deviation of the short term interest rate from the standard Taylor-rule were largest. Similar, De Grauwe (2010) suggests a positive relation between bank credit and rising real house prices. But those analyses do not provide real causal or econometric evidence. Studies that empirically estimate an interest rate reaction function and perform a counterfactual to determine the difference between a benchmark or optimal interest rate and the actual one, like the papers of Hayo (2006) and, Honohan and Leddin (2006), are scarce. Other studies attempt to provide econometric evidence of the impact of monetary policy on property prices. Seyfried (2010), for example, estimates a multivariate regression model of a standard house price model and finds that between 2001 and 2007 the average Irish house price would have increased by only 4.2% per annum while actual prices rose about 9.8%. However, a normative Taylor-rule is used without econometric verification as to whether it can explain the ECB’s monetary policy well or not.====The fact is that anno 2015, the euro and the Irish economy are still under pressure and thus it is crucial to assess the costs and benefits of euro membership and understand the role of the euro in the genesis of the crisis. Because it is likely that it was not only interest rates that played a role, it is important to come up with clear empirical evidence concerning the causal relationship between euro membership, monetary policy and the property bubble. Therefore this paper seeks to answer the following questions:====In order to answer these questions and determine whether or not it was a coincidence that Ireland’s economic fundamentals began to deteriorate when it joined the euro area, Section 2 presents the analytical framework used to evaluate the appropriateness of the ECB’s monetary policy for the Irish economy. We estimate the Taylor-rule for the ECB and Ireland and use these results to perform a counterfactual analysis. It allows us to assess the extent to which interest rates were inappropriate given Irish economic conditions. In Section 3 we determine the link between the monetary policy and the housing market by estimating a Bayesian Vector Auto Correction (BVAR) model and discuss the model estimates and policy implications. These results are complemented with an intuitive multivariate housing model. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the main findings and concludes.",Did monetary policy fuel the housing bubble?

Increased military activity may have insulated the formal economy of the border area from poor economic performance and the deindustrialization that characterizes adjacent areas. The current Oblast Administration’s grant program to localities does not reward relatively efficient economic performance with a model suggested here to change the policy. The region’s economy has the ability to absorb many Ukrainian refugees though non-economic issues support the current assistance from other Russian regions in helping relocate refugees beyond Rostov region. Like other conflict zones, urban areas experience less of an impact relative to rural areas.","Sanctions have been in use for over 2000 years with the question of whether they achieve the sender’s objectives often questioned calling for analytical measurement of at least the economic portion of the impact with some evidence that U.S. trade law sanctions were more successful in the late 20th century than other types of economic sanctions (see Eaton & Engers, 1999 and literature cited there). More recently, economic sanctions have remained a popular policy tool though evidence of their impact is even more mixed (Smeets, 2018) with perhaps a symbolic component of “doing something” a reason for continued popularity. The formal theoretical literature on sanctions is small with the lack of a well organized opposition group inside the target country a drawback to sanctions and a “rallying round the flag” patriotic effect only recently modelled (Miyagiwa & Ohno, 2015). Sanctions against Russia since 2014 in particular are hard to measure as the concurrent fall in the oil price with a stronger economic effect has clouded the short term economic impact while the long term impact may be a further delay of the deep structural reforms to the Russian economy sought by reformers both in and outside of Russia (Korhonen, Simola, & Solanko, 2018). Only one study shows that controlling for oil price changes using fixed effects, sanctioned firms were negatively impacted more than other Russian firms (Ahn & Ludema, 2017). Agricultural counter sanctions by the Russians combined with a weakening of the exchange rate has, as in the 1998 crisis, boosted import substitution with the dollar value of Russian agricultural exports now exceeding the dollar value of weapons exports (Troianovski, 2018). Thus an examination of an agricultural region such as Rostov Oblast is hypothesized to show that sanctions may have even improved the regional economy.====While the existence of the Russian military in Eastern Ukraine is disputed by Moscow, there is no dispute that the military is very active just across the border in Rostov Oblast among other Russian regions. Rostov has hosted temporary military bases since 2014 to shell and support intrusions in to Ukraine with the temporary nature of the bases questionable given the willingness of Russia to foment and continue long lasting “frozen wars” in the CIS areas adjacent to Russia. The Rostov airport and railways serve as the exclusive departure point for both soldiers and volunteers heading in to Ukraine with initially the same “green men” used initially in Crimea who deny being Russian soldiers. How many cross the border is unknown as even officially approved observers could not easily get to the border 2014–2015 (====, accessed 3/2/2018). The lack of access suggested alternative methods of monitoring such as using satellite data by the Geospatial Technologies and Human Rights Project of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (====, accessed 1/21/2017). Data revealed clear evidence of increased 2014 military activity in at least two districts of Rostov Oblast (town of Kuzminka on the border of Myasnikovskii and Neklinovskii districts; outskirts of the city of Novocherkassk in Oktyabrskii district). Such evidence suggests an unusual military stimulus to a Russian region’s economy at a time when the country was experiencing sanctions first after seizing Crimea (March/April 2014) followed by broader “Donbas” sanctions (August 2014). Here the impact on rural Rostov’s informal and formal economy’s performance between 2013 and 2015 improves understanding of how the Ukrainian crisis impacts rural Rostov. The study represents a follow up to the examination of the region just prior to the crisis (Brock, 2015) using a new generation of satellite data that only became available in 2013. The null hypothesis is that rural areas of Rostov near the Ukrainian border and cities will exhibit good economic performance despite sanctions thanks to high military activity, Russian counter measures bolstering domestic agricultural performance via import substitution, and the August 2014 “Donbas” sanctions impacting Russian oil and defense firms primarily in other regions. For these reasons, unlike sanctions in other parts of the world (e.g. Lee, 2014), even rural non-border areas should remain unaffected too. Further, the hypothesis that the large informal economy in Russia will be smaller in a militarized region is tested by estimating the size of Rostov’s informal economy before and after hostilities began. The paper can be seen as a case study examination of the hegemonic activity of a regional power within a regional sphere of influence but constrained by global level constraints (Destradi & Gundlach, 2014).====In addition to satellite data allowing general observation and prediction when other data are unavailable especially at the regional level (e.g. Lessman & Seidel, 2017) or are of poor quality (Nordhaus & Chen, 2015), satellite data also have been used to proxy total economic activity which when subtracted from official economic activity yield a quantitative measure of the informal economy. Our hypothesis is that newly militarized zones would have a relatively more formal than informal economy as local procurement and support gains greater attention by local authorities when the military is involved. Though the informal regional economy in Russia has been examined using electricity consumption (Kim & Kang, 2009; Smith & Thomas, 2015) and satellite data (Bennett & Smith, 2017), we found no studies of the informal economy using night lights data at the sub-regional (==== level for Russia which is especially important for Rostov Oblast as the area is believed to have a relatively larger informal economy than other regions (Ketova, Kolesnikov, & Ovchinnikov, 2015). Like many other countries, no local administrative area gross output (e.g. in the U.S. — Gross County Product (GCP)) formal economy data exists in Russia (Kolechkov, 2014) though it would be quite useful for measuring the strength of fiscal incentives at the subnational level (Alexeev, 2016). We derive such a measure using Rostov’s official Gross Regional Product (GRP) and sub-regional input data for comparison with the luminosity data. Therefore all official data come from the same source – the Russian Statistical Agency (Rossstat) – and are assumed to be of high enough quality to approximately measure the formal economy. Considering derived GCP and luminosity data together, we follow Henderson et al. (2012) and assume that if luminosity grows (falls) between 2013 and 2015 but GCP falls (grows), the informal economy is larger (smaller) after the initial sanctions and military activity. If both measures move in the same direction, then the result is indeterminate though a much larger growth rate of one over the other may suggest biased growth. We assume that the informal economy is a dual economy that formal economic growth will not cause to fade away (La Porta & Shleifer, 2014) with at least one study calling workers in the Russian informal sector “heroes” for their resilience and flexibility (Kapelyushnikov, Kuznetsov, & Kuznetsova, 2012). While formal economic growth often includes improved entrepreneurship, in the case of Rostov’s rural economy it is more likely caused by more fiscal (military) spending stimulating the existing formal sector and pulling resources away from the informal sector at a time when much of the country is in recession. We test rayon formal sector improvement both descriptively (GCP) and econometrically using the widely applied stochastic frontier method previously applied to pre-2014 Rostov rayons by Brock (2015). We also descriptively compare urban performance with rural areas but cannot use econometrics due to small sample sizes. Finally our analysis also facilitates a very practical policy critique of an existing Oblast administration investment grant program (e.g. Pravitel’stvo Rostovskoy Oblasti, 2013, 2014) to see if monies are going to relatively high performance localities as the program claims to be designed to do.====Section two reviews the literature on night light analysis of Rostov and the data used in the study. Section three discusses the methods used to measure economic performance the application of which in the economic sanctions literature is very new as methods such as a gravity model (e.g. Fritz, Christen, Sinabell, & Hinz, 2017) are more popular.

However, the extent to which the process has made monetary policy globally integrated and in what way monetary policy shocks are transmitted internationally needs further investigation.====Despite some significant efforts towards understanding this topic in general and as well as with regard to emerging market economies, the issues pertaining specifically to emerging market economies have received relatively little attention. Further interest in the international linkages and co-movements between different regions of the world is important. One economic relationship of particular interest is the relationship between Turkey and the European Union. This relationship is important because of Turkey’s long-held ambition of joining the European Union and given the degree of trade and economic linkages of Turkey with the EU, the effect of European Central Bank (ECB) policy definitely needs further investigation. Kucharcukova, Claeys, and Vasicek (2016) investigates the spillover of ECB policy on countries outside the EA that keep their own autonomous monetary policy. Their results indicate that those countries are affected by the economic developments and the common monetary policy of the EA. Further, with financial liberalization and particularly during the global crisis, the Turkish Central Bank and other economic agents always kept an eye on the Federal Reserve decisions and actions. Turkey has a large external financing requirement and Turkey’s foreign debt is denominated mostly in US dollar, which even puts more pressure on the economy leading to a lower credit rating and a higher borrowing cost.====Turkey attracted significant net capital flows after implementing the 2001 reform and the structural change program, democratization and close relationship with the EU, until the 2008 global financial crisis. After the 2008 global crisis, the Federal Reserve and other central banks undertook extraordinary measures to restore their economies, pulling interest rates to near-zero levels. This created an artificial supply of liquidity globally which prompted portfolio managers to invest in emerging markets, including China, Brazil, India, and Turkey. These dynamics had helped Turkey, along with other emerging economies, to outperform over the past several years. However, the reversal of the high liquidity period which came after the Fed’s announcement in 2013 on the tapering of the Quantitative Easing led to significant capital outflows, sharp currency depreciation, increased market volatility, and higher long-term interest rates. The impact was more severe for those countries that had large current account deficits, limited public finances, and large borrowings in foreign currency.====Analyzing the process by which economic shocks in specific countries spread to other countries is highly important from the standpoint of policy-making. Considering Turkey’s open and interdependent economy, Turkey is frequently influenced by foreign shocks to a great extent. We are interested in whether it matters or not where a monetary shock originates from, and in this paper, we specifically analyze the shocks coming from two of the world’s largest economies, the U.S. and the Euro area (hereafter EA). The international transmission of U.S. monetary shocks to the rest of the world is a widely accepted phenomenon and as Rey (2016) points out, the international transmission of U.S. monetary shocks affects economic and financial circumstances even in inflation-targeting economies with big financial markets. In this context, several relevant questions arise: What is the nature of the mechanism by which U.S. and EA monetary policy effects are transmitted to an emerging market economy like Turkey? Would a monetary expansion in the U.S. have the same consequences as that of the EA on the macroeconomic variables in Turkey? How would the global commodity price shocks affect the Turkish macroeconomic variables?====This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating that monetary expansion in the world’s two largest and most influential economies has significant but contradictory impacts on the Turkish economy. Particularly, the varying effects of U.S. and EA monetary aggregates and the influence of world price of primary commodities, the world price of energy products and the crude oil price on Turkish variables are underpinned in this study. The initial macroeconomic and monetary variables in Turkey are chosen as the consumer price index to measure the effect on the price level, the industrial production index to account for the aggregate output, M2 as the monetary aggregate, the CBRT policy rate as the interest rate, and the real effective exchange rate to see how the exchange rate of Turkey reacts to international monetary shocks. We use a structural VAR model for our investigation. For SVAR models 1 and 2, we use the standard 5-variable model investigating the effect of monetary expansion on the above-mentioned macroeconomic variables. Consecutively, we further extend the SVAR model of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999), Dedola and Lippi (2005), Kim and Roubini (2000), and Vespignani (2015) to see the effects of the monetary and global price shocks on the current account balance, trade balance, real exports, and real imports of Turkey. We carry out this analysis in SVAR models 1+ and 2+ by alternating between the four above-mentioned variables. This analysis also reveals interesting results on transmission channels working through trade and current account balances.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses several background studies providing an empirical and a theoretical framework for the analysis, Section 3 explains the methodology and data, and Section 4 refers to the various analyses conducted and presents empirical results.

The relationship between government spending and national income is important for policy makers. This is because recessionary and expansionary periods require the share of government spending to GNP increases and decreases, respectively. The relationship between government spending and national output is also relevant for the debate about the sustainability of public finances, especially during the phase when governments struggle to restrain public sector size.====The long-run relation between government expenditures and national output has been a lively topic of empirical studies. The existence of a positive covariance between the two variables was first suggested by the German political economist Adolph Wagner so called “law of increasing state activity” (Wagner, 1883, 1893). He asserts three main reasons for increased government involvement: First, in an increasingly complex society, the need for public protective and regulative activity would grow. Furthermore, urbanization and greater division of labor accompanying industrialization would require higher expenditures on contractual enforcement and Law in order to create the efficient performance of the economy.====Second, Wagner argues that growth in real income would facilitate the relative expansion of income-elastic (cultural and welfare) expenditures. Education and culture are mentioned in particular, suggesting that collective producers are in general more efficient than private ones. Third, he claims that economic development and changes in technology required government to assume the management of natural monopolies in order to enhance economic efficiency. Thus, the expansion of public spending can be seen as a product of the economic development, and not vice versa (Bird, 1971).====Therefore, the Wagnerian approach indicates a hypothesis describing the evolution of the government spending share, including the effect stemming from differences in productivity growth of government and private sector production. Wagner’s Law represents a crucial factor for fiscal rigidity and the government debt problem. If the law is strongly supported, then government spending or budget size increases at a more rapid rate than economic growth, consequently government is likely to be forced to quit a flexible fiscal policy or to borrow excessively (Funashima & Hiraga, 2017).====Previous studies on the Wagner Law can be classified into three groups: first, studies finding support for Wagner’s Law (e.g., Ahsan, Kwan, & Sahni, 1996; Akitoby, Clements, Gupta, & Inchauste, 2006; Bairam, 1992; Kolluri, Panik, & Wahab, 2000; Lin, 1995; Mohammadi, Cak, & Cak, 2008; Murthy, 1993; Nagarajan & Spears, 1990; Narayan, Nielsen, & Smyth, 2008; Oxley, 1994; Ram, 1992; Zaghini & Lamartina, 2008; Ono, 2014; Barra, Bimonte, & Spennati, 2015), second, studies finding qualified support for Wagner’s Law, i.e., those studies which include additional variables and some especial types of expenditure (e.g., Arpaia & Turrini, 2008; Bairam, 1995; Biswal, Dhawan, & Lee, 1999; Bohl, 1996; Chang, 2002; Chow, Cotsomitis, & Kwan, 2002; Courakis, Moura-Roque, & Tridimas, 1993; Olekalns, 1999; Payne & Ewing, 1996; Magazzino, 2012), and third, studies not finding support for Wagner’s Law (e.g., Burney, 2002; Chletsos & Kollias, 1997; Ghate & Zak, 2002; Hayo, 1994; Halicioglu, 2003; Henrekson, 1993; Huang, 2006; Katrakilidis and Tsaliki, 2009; Kolluri & Wahab, 2007; Narayan et al., 2008; Shelton, 2007; Wahab, 2004; Ziramba, 2008; Durevall & Henrekson, 2011; Moore, 2016).====Thus, over the past three decades, numerous studies focus on several countries and time periods by applying the concepts of cointegration (linear and nonlinear) and causality. Empirical findings are mixed and contradictory. Furthermore, population structure, even though it should affect expenditure, has been neglected in most studies on Wagner’s Law. The aim of this paper is to examine the augmented Wagner Law in 12 OECD countries over the period of 1995–2015. The paper employs the bootstrap panel Granger causality approach that accounts for cross-sectional dependence, slope heterogeneity, and structural breaks across countries to determine the structure of causality. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to apply the bootstrap panel Granger causality when examining the causal relationship between government spending and national income.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the theoretical considerations, data and methodology.

Employing data for 20 countries between 1800 and 2010, it is found that (i) while non-adult mortality has no long-run effect on GDP per capita, reductions in adult mortality lead to statistically and economically significant increases in the long-run level of per capita income; (ii) there are no significant differences in the long-run effects of adult mortality and non-adult mortality on GDP per capita before and after the onset of the demographic transition; and (iii) mortality in middle adulthood has the greatest impact on economic development, whereas early adulthood mortality and mortality in later adulthood have little to no impact on the long-run level of per capita income.","Although many researchers and policy makers believe that reductions in mortality lead to increases in income per capita, empirical work has not yielded consistent results: Some studies, such as Knowles and Owen (1999) and Aghion, Howitt, and Murtin (2011), find a positive influence of improvements in life expectancy at birth on GDP per capita growth; others, including Bloom, Canning, and Fink (2014) and Hansen (2014), fail to uncover a robust causal effect of life expectancy at birth on GDP per capita growth; still other studies, such as Acemoglu and Johnson (2007), Acemoglu and Johnson (2014) and Hansen and Lønstrup (2015), find a negative effect of life expectancy at birth on GDP per capita; finally, there is a study by Cervellati and Sunde (2011) suggesting that the effect of life expectancy at birth on economic growth is insignificant or negative before and positive after the demographic transition from high to low fertility and mortality.====In general, this literature focuses either on a summary measure for all age-specific mortality rates, such as life expectancy at birth, or on a measure of adult or infant/child mortality. Thus, the question of whether the effect of adult mortality on GDP per capita differs from that of non-adult mortality has received little attention in the empirical literature, despite its obvious economic importance.====In one of the few studies on this issue, Lorentzen, McMillan, and Wacziarg (2008) use cross-country annual data averaged over the period 1960–2000 for a sample of up to 94 countries and find in OLS and instrumental variable (IV) regressions a significant negative effect of both infant mortality (measured by the probability of dying before age 1 year) and adult mortality (measured by the probability of surviving to age 60 years, conditional on surviving to age 15 years) on economic growth. However, when they estimate a simultaneous-equations system where the potential growth effects of infant and adult mortality are modeled via possible indirect effects on physical capital investment, secondary schooling, and fertility, they find a statistically significant negative effect of adult mortality and an insignificant effect of infant mortality.====In the same paper, Lorentzen et al. (2008) also report fixed effects, random effects, and between estimates based on an unbalanced 10-year panel covering the period 1970–2000 for up to 19 Indian states. Consistent with the results from their simultaneous equations model, they find in these regressions that reductions in the adult mortality rate (of males aged 20–40) are significantly associated with increases in economic growth, whereas the infant mortality rate (per 1000 live births) is not significantly associated with growth.====In a related study, Aghion, Howitt, and Murtin (2011) use the cross-sectional data from the study of Lorentzen et al. (2008) to estimate OLS regressions of time averaged growth rates on time averaged infant and adult mortality data as well as OLS regressions of time averaged growth rates on initial levels of infant and adult mortality. In all these regressions, which are based a sample of 94 countries for the 1960–2000 period, the coefficients of infant and adult mortality are negative. However, while the infant mortality variable is always statistically significant, they find in one regression that lower adult mortality is not significantly associated with higher growth.====Using 10-year panel regressions covering 28 OECD countries over the 1960–2000 period, Aghion et al. (2011) also find that life expectancy at birth is significantly positively related to growth in GDP per capita, whereas life expectancies at ages 40, 60, and 80 are insignificant when included together with life expectancy at birth. From this finding, Aghion et al. (2011, p. 21) conclude that “reducing mortality below age 40 is particularly growth-enhancing.”====A final paper related to this issue is Acemoglu and Johnson (2007), who consider not only the impact of life expectancy at birth on GDP per capita but also that of life expectancy at age 20. Using long-difference specifications, where the change in the dependent variable between two time points is regressed on the change in the independent variables between the same two time points, they find in cross-sectional IV regressions for up to 45 countries for 1940–1980 and 1960–2000 that life expectancy at age 20 has a significant negative effect on GDP per capita. Interestingly, the magnitude of the coefficient on life expectancy at age 20 is, in absolute terms, much greater than the magnitude of the coefficient on life expectancy at birth (–3.27 versus –1.32 in the base sample for 1940–1980). This finding implies that an increase in adult mortality exerts a greater growth-enhancing effect than an equivalent increase in infant mortality. The smaller estimated effect of life expectancy at birth is even consistent with the possibility that reductions in infant or child mortality promote growth.====Given the small number of studies examining how mortality at different age periods affects economic development, and the opposing findings of the current research, the purpose of this study is to provide additional evidence on the effects of mortality of adults and non-adults (including infants, children, and adolescents) on the long-run, or steady-state, level of GDP per capita.====Our study differs from the above studies in three ways. ====, we use a panel dataset of annual observations for 20 countries between 1800 and 2010. This long sample period allows us to examine the long-run effects of adult and non-adult mortality on GDP per capita over time. In addition, since all countries in our sample went through their demographic transitions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, our 211-year sample period allows us to analyze the mortality–income relationship during the demographic transition and to test whether the effects of adult and non-adult mortality differ before and after the onset of the demographic transition; this might be of particular interest to developing countries since many of these countries have not completed their demographic transitions.====, we not only present results for one measure of adult mortality (life expectancy at age 21) and one measure of non-adult mortality (the mortality rate up to age 21), but we also experiment with different age-specific mortality rates and life expectancies to improve our understanding of how changes in mortality at different ages contribute to economic development. Better understanding of the economic consequences of reductions in mortality at different ages can assist policy makers in allocating scarce health resources.====, we use recently developed panel time series methods that allow us to account for heterogeneous effects of adult and non-adult mortality on GDP per capita across countries. Suppose, for example, that increased life expectancy increases schooling since the returns to investment in education increase over a longer working life. To the extent that the impact of schooling on economic growth varies across countries, depending on country-specific factors such as the quality of schooling and the ability of countries to use schooling productively,==== we should expect that the impact of mortality on economic growth is heterogeneous as well. It is therefore important to account for cross-country heterogeneity; otherwise, the estimates of the long-run effects might be inconsistent (Pesaran & Smith, 1995).====In addition, the methods we use allow us to test whether adult and non-adult mortality are weakly exogenous or “long-run forcing” for GDP per capita and to obtain consistent parameter estimates even in the presence of feedback effects from GDP per capita. Thus, our empirical strategy has the advantage that we do not need to rely on instrumental variables, which are difficult, if not impossible, to find.====Finally, the estimation methods we use allow us to adequately control for cross-sectional dependence due to common shocks or spillovers among countries at the same time. The conventional approach to account for common shocks is to include time dummies. However, the use of time dummies assumes that all panel units react identically to common shocks, and may therefore be ineffective in eliminating cross-sectional dependence when countries respond differently to common shocks. Our approach does not make this assumption, and thus allows for cross-country differences in the impact of unobserved common factors.====To preview our main results, we find that (i) while non-adult mortality has no long-run effect on GDP per capita, reductions in adult mortality lead to statistically and economically significant increases in the long-run level of per capita income; (ii) there are no significant differences in the long-run effects of adult mortality and non-adult mortality on GDP per capita before and after the onset of the demographic transition; and (iii) per capita income responds mainly to changes in mortality at middle adult ages, whereas early adulthood mortality and mortality in later adulthood have little to no effect on the long-run level of per capita income.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the potential theoretical effects of adult and non-adult mortality on the long-run level of income. Section 3 presents the basic empirical model, discusses some econometric issues, and describes the data. The econometric implementation and the estimation results are presented in Section 4.

It exceeded 100% of gross domestic products (GDP) in the late 1980s and the early 2000s. Although it has been declined in the recent past and becomes 79.3% of GDP in 2016; the high level of debt in a weak fiscal position of the small economy Sri Lanka is an issue of concern. In this backdrop, this paper examines the impact of public debt and foreign aid on income, ==== and ==== both in the short-run and in the long-run, while no significant impact of the domestic debt on interest rate is found. Based on these findings, the paper elaborates on some long-term measures for reducing the dependence on debt and aid in Sri Lanka.","Since the independence, Sri Lanka has endured a weak fiscal position and the shortage of development finance. To meet the development needs in a vulnerable fiscal scenario, an accumulation of government borrowing was inevitable. Since then Sri Lanka has been reliant heavily on external financial assistance in the form of public debt and foreign aid. Public debt here means government borrowing, which is the total of external borrowing (or foreign debt) and internal borrowing (or internal debt). The accumulation of public debt (at the 2002 price level) has increased from Rs. 390,562.8 million in 1977 to Rs. 3,056,586 million in 2016; which is more than 68 times increase over the past 39 years. In other words, public debt as a percent of gross domestic products (GDP) has increased from 68.6% in 1977 to more than 100% in the year 1988, 1989 and further during the years 2001–2004. In the last decade, it has been declining and became 79.3% of GDP in 2016.====It is often viewed that public debt and foreign aid are indispensable for the developing countries, particularly at the early stage of development. It asserts that due to stringent financial constraint, developing countries fail to utilize domestic resources, cannot launch development programs and, as a result, it becomes difficult to achieve long-term desired growth. Accumulation of external financial assistance in the form of public debt and foreign aid may be a way out from the fiscal impasse. Such assistance, in the form of public debt, plays an important role to supplement scarce domestic resources, contributes to increasing investment and capital stock which, in a passage of time, may accelerate the pace of economic growth. It may also help to achieve takeoffs into a self-sustaining growth path.====Despite these favorable roles, public debt sometimes fails to achieve the desired objectives of the recipient countries. Presbitero (2012) highlights few macroeconomic channels through which a growing public debt might hamper long-run growth prospects in developing countries, mainly focusing on foreign borrowing. Public debt may have a negative impact on economic growth through a standard crowding out effect (Panizza & Presbitero, 2014). A high level of public debt may depress economic growth and promote debt overhang (Krugman, 1988, Sach, 1989), can reduce domestic savings, can tend to stimulate capital flight (Cerra & Saxena, 2008). They also stated that a positive correlation between weak institutions, high debt and capital flight might be found.====Foreign aid is indispensable for the developing countries to supplement low domestic savings which could be directed to invest and to supplement export earnings required to import capital goods for investment. Aiyar, Berg, and Hussain (2005), in a discussion of the macroeconomic challenge of more aid, have highlighted possible responses of the government to an aid surge in the short-to-medium-term. They also view that if foreign aid is utilized correctly, it helps rising stakes in the development challenge. It may appreciate the exchange rate that could impair the export-led growth. Cerra & Saxena (2008) view that foreign aid tends to reduce capital flight. The macroeconomic impact of such an aid flow eventually depends on how the government responds. Nevertheless, the macroeconomic impact of foreign assistance, including both public debt and foreign aid may depend on how these are channeled to the development activities. More specifically, the favorable impact of such assistance also depends on some institutional factors like good governance, socio-political conditions of the country, etc.====It is, therefore, an important issue to inquire whether a large and growing external financial assistance enhances economic growth and fulfills other desired objectives of the recipient countries. Accordingly, economic literature over the last few decades is augmented with a plethora of empirical research on public debt and foreign aid in countries concerned. However, such an issue in the context of the Sri Lankan economy is scantily documented. Moreover the existing studies viz. Fonseka and Ranasinghe (2008), Kumara and Cooray (2013), Akram (2013) and Mahmood, Arby, and Sherazi (2014) have examined the impact of public debt on growth and the threshold level of debt.====Furthermore, few studies namely, Chowdhury and Das (2011), Asteriou (2009), Hatemi-J and Irandoust (2005) have enlightened some issues of foreign aid in the context of some South Asian countries including Sri Lanka (the detail of these studies is reported in Section 3). To the best of knowledge, the impact of aid on the price level and interest rate in Sri Lanka is not documented.====Under this backdrop, this study examines the impact of public debt and foreign aid on selected macroeconomic variables including income, price level and interest rate in Sri Lanka for the post-economic reform period, 1977–2016.==== Specifically, the long-run association and the causal impacts of public debt in total and its components — internal, external debt, in addition to foreign aid, money supply (a control variable) on income, price level and interest rate are examined. Besides the dynamic impacts of debt and aid along with money supply on the selected macroeconomics variables have also been traced involving impulse response functions. It is expected that the paper would contribute to the literature of public debt and foreign aid by providing Sri Lankan evidence which might have policy implications of the government, economists and even to the donor agencies.====The rest of the paper is divided into four more sections where, Section 2 presents some facts and figures of public debt and foreign aid in Sri Lanka followed by Section 3, presents efficacy of public debt and foreign aid: a review of the literature. Empirical strategy and results are presented in Section 4.

Using the coarsened exact matching method, we find that participation in both programmes exerts a positive influence on the ","The economic crisis has deeply deteriorated the European labour market, especially in Southern Europe. During this period, job destruction in the region has increased dramatically, with unemployment rates rising sharply, in particular among young and low-skilled individuals. This has translated into a strong decline in the major living standards of unemployed people, thus increasing inequality. Apart from the strong rise in the overall unemployment rate, south European countries have experienced a significant increase in the percentage of long-term unemployed (those unemployed that have been seeking work for at least a year, LTU hereafter).====Among European countries, Spain has been one of the most affected by the economic crisis, reaching unprecedented levels of long-term unemployment. In particular, the unemployment rate reached 26.1% in 2013, and the percentage of LTU rose from 23.7% in 2007 to 61.8% in 2014. Despite the substantial labour market reform in 2012==== and the beginning of the economic recovery in 2014, unemployment is still one of the most relevant structural problems of the Spanish economy: the unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 16.7%, and still more than 1.9 million people are LTU, of which 1.4 million are very long-term unemployed. According to the European Commission, Public Employment Services (PES) should play a leading role to mitigate the adverse effects of the economic recession and to reduce long-term unemployment. An important tool to achieve this aim are active labour market policies (ALMPs).====However, PES in Spain are characterised by their marginal role in the intermediation of the job matching process, which has even decreased in recent years. Moreover, although ALMPs in Spain expanded until 2010 in terms of expenditure, they suffered important budgetary cuts during the period 2011–2013.====In a parallel manner, concerns about how to achieve more effective targeting of ALMPs and resource allocation have gained special attention among policymakers in the EU member states. As a result, in recent years, many research papers have focused on the causal impact of specific ALMP measures. Although the Spanish government is promoting policy evaluation,==== so far this kind of exercises are quite scarce in Spain, and the majority of them refer to the pre-crisis period (see, for example, Arellano, 2010; Borra, Palma, Gonzalez, & Aguado, 2012; Cansino Muñoz-Repiso & Sánchez Braza, 2011; Cueto & Mato, 2009; Cueto, Toharia, García-Serrano, & Alujas, 2010; Mato & Cueto, 2008; Ramos, Surinach, & Artís, 2009).==== To the best of our knowledge, the only work that focuses on the crisis period is that of Clemente, García Castrillo, González-Alvarez, and Sanso (2014).====This paper attempts to partially contribute to this literature by providing an empirical evaluation of participation in ALMPs on the employment probability of Spanish LTU. Specifically, we focus on two activation measures in Spain: training and job search assistance (JSA). Although the aims of both programmes are to increase the probability, efficiency and quality of labour market matching, there are some differences between them that are worth mentioning. Training programmes are measures that provide incentives for human capital enhancement by upgrading workers’ skills. Thus, these are included in the type of ALMPs intended to enhance employability by increasing workers’ productivity. In contrast, the aim of JSA programmes is to help unemployed workers find a job through counselling and support services, as well as provide access to and information on the labour market situation and trends.====Moreover, we account for the quality of the employment relationship by considering two kinds of employment (==== and ==== jobs) attending to specific features related to job security, measured by the type of contract and working hours. We also distinguish between two different post-programme time horizons: short-term (12 months after completion of the programme) and medium-term (24 months after completion).====This investigation is interesting for a number of reasons. First, long-term unemployment can have serious adverse effects for individuals as it entails the depreciation of skills, more difficulties to get hired, less time devoted to the job search and hence more probabilities of leaving the labour market. Consequently, a high level of long-term unemployment threatens social cohesion, as it exposes individuals to a risk of social exclusion and society to high levels of structural unemployment. In addition, it entails enormous challenges for policymakers. In this respect, and due to the persistence of long-term unemployment in Europe in the aftermath of the crisis, the Council Recommendation of 15 February 2016==== called upon the Member States to provide individualised assistance to all LTU. The Spanish response has been materialised in the ==== which is based on an agreement between the central government and the regions to devote a budget of 515 million euros to provide individualised assistance and close monitoring of 1 million long-term unemployed persons until 2018.====Second, there is recent empirical evidence suggesting that well-targeted ALMP measures are an effective and cost-efficient tool in the fight against long-term unemployment (see Card, Kluve, & Weber, 2015). However, Spain has a poor track record in the field of ALMPs, and the budget of PES for such policies suffered considerable cuts during the crisis. To the extent that our results shed some light on the most effective active measures intended to improve the employment prospects of LTU in Spain, they might facilitate the intermediation role of PES in the job matching process.====Finally, an additional contribution of this study relies on the econometric methodology used to obtain the causal effects of participation in active measures on the employment probabilities of the LTU. In particular, we apply the coarsened exact matching algorithm (CEM) proposed by Iacus, King, and Porro (2009), Iacus, King, & Porro (2011b) and Blackwell, Iacus, King, and Porro (2009). In contrast to other matching procedures, by reducing the imbalance between the treated and control groups, the CEM method improves causal inference and hence obtains more accurate estimates of participation on employment probabilities among the LTU.====For the purposes of the paper we use microdata from administrative records of the Spanish PES for the period January 2010 to December 2012. Specifically, we use a subsample of unemployed jobseekers participating in these ALMPs in the Community of Madrid and construct a specific control group of non-participants that has the same distribution of observables as the group of participants in the corresponding programme.====Our results suggest that participation in both kinds of programmes exerts a positive and significant influence on the probability of getting both significant and non-significant jobs at all time horizons. However, the effect of participation in training policies is stronger than participation in JSA measures. Furthermore, a relevant finding is that the effect of ALMPs is more intense among LTU, thus suggesting the convenience of participating in this kind of measures for this group of jobseekers. These findings thus provide a diagnosis of the most effective measures to increase the employment probabilities of LTU, and should be taken into consideration by PES in their attempt to optimise the positive impact of the available resources.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Following this introduction, Section 2 reviews the literature on the effects of ALMPs. In Section 3 we describe the database and the procedure applied to construct the control group. In Section 4 we present the results of the econometric analysis and discuss the main results.

To do so, this paper constructs a geometric composite index with Benefit-of-the-Doubt weights as a measure of a Member State’s overall performance on the EU2020 headline indicators. A tripartite decomposition of Member State performance change is presented to explain and analyze performance change of the EU-region and the individual EU Member States during the period 2008–2014. The results reveal that all Member States are in general making progress towards their national targets. Member States generally moved forward in the areas of R&D, environmental and educational policy and moved backwards in terms of employment and ","The European Union launched the Europe 2020 Strategy during the European Council held in Brussels in 2010. Being the successor of the Lisbon Strategy, the Europe 2020 Strategy shares similar objectives to its predecessor, namely to stimulate sustainable and inclusive economic growth. However, in addition to the main objective of sustainable economic growth, the Europe 2020 Strategy also adds a strong emphasis on environmental concerns, promotion of social inclusion and the reduction of poverty. The Europe 2020 Strategy focuses on five headline targets comprising in total eight sub-targets that are to be achieved by 2020. These targets cover the domains of employment, research and development, climate and energy, education, social inclusion and poverty reduction. The main target for the EU-region as a whole as far as employment is concerned, is that 75% of the 20–64 year-olds are to be employed by 2020. For the domain of R&D, the EU-target is that 3% of the EU's GDP is invested in R&D. The Europe 2020 Strategy also wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the EU-region by 20% (or even 30%, if the conditions are right) as compared to the level of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. Additionally, by 2020, 20% of all European energy should come from renewable sources and on average a 20% increase in total energy efficiency should be realized across EU Member States. Concerning education, the rates of early school leaving should be reduced to below 10%, and at least 40% of 30–34-year-olds should have completed tertiary level education. Finally, measures should be taken to ensure that by 2020 in the EU-region the number of people in a situation of poverty and social exclusion or at risk of such a situation should be at least 20 million lower. Each of these targets was translated into national targets, giving individual Member States a way to check their own progress towards these goals. These national targets also take into account the different starting positions of the Member States. With five headline targets measured by eight sub-indicators, the Europe 2020 Strategy is a very comprehensive project capturing many different facets of society. To make sure that the Europe 2020 strategy delivers, the Commission implemented a system to harmonize and coordinate policy actions between the EU and national authorities. In particular, for each of the EU Member States, progress on the set of indicators set out by the Europe 2020 Strategy is monitored during the European Semester, the EU's yearly cycle of policy coordination (European Commission, 2011).====The aim of the present paper consists in providing a comprehensive evaluation of the progress made by the EU Member States towards their national targets on the set of indicators as specified by the Europe 2020 Strategy. To do so, the evolution of the EU Member States’ performance on Europe 2020 indicators for employment, research and development, climate and energy, education, social inclusion and poverty reduction are analyzed for the years 2008 and 2014. To evaluate the overall performance of the EU Member States, we construct a geometric composite index using Van Puyenbroeck and Rogge’s (2017) variant of the ‘benefit-of-the-doubt’ (BoD)-weighted composite indicator. This approach differs in two important ways from the previously used composite indicators to evaluate EU Member State performances on the Europe 2020 strategy (Çolak & Ege, 2013; Pasimeni, 2012, 2013; Rappai, 2016). Firstly, instead of using equal weighting or any other format of fixed weighting (like, for instance, Pasimeni (2012, 2013)), Van Puyenbroeck and Rogge’s (2017) composite index uses BoD-weights for the eight sub-indicators. In essence, it concerns country-specific sets of optimal weights that are determined on the basis of the performance data on the sub-indicators of the evaluated Member States themselves. The main conceptual starting point of the BoD-weighting method is that in the absence of any detailed information on the ‘true’ weights, representative weights can be retrieved from the observed sub-indicator data themselves (i.e., letting the data speak for themselves). The BoD-model looks for the weights that maximize the impact of sub-indicators of relative strengths and minimize the influence of sub-indicators of relative weaknesses. This indeed means that each Member State is granted the benefit-of-the-doubt when it comes to assigning weights in the building-up of the composite indicator.====There are many reasons for using BoD-weights in the construction of CIs for evaluating countries performances on complex and multidimensional policy projects such as the Europe 2020 Strategy. Firstly, whereas in practice poorly performing Member States often criticize the reliability of the CI-scores and CI-ranking, claiming the use of unfavourable weights, this criticism cannot be invoked against BoD-weighted CIs since any other weighting scheme than the BoD set of weights would worsen the position of the evaluated country vis-à-vis the other countries. Secondly, and somewhat related to the first reason, a main practical advantage of using BoD-weights when analyzing policy performances of countries is its pragmatic stance. As countries are often sensitive about being evaluated, compared and benchmarked against other countries, granting countries the benefit of the doubt is a very attractive option. Thirdly, in a setting in which there is typically disagreement among policy makers, experts and stakeholders about what are effective policies for achieving the policy targets (and, hence, about what are true policy weights for the different sub-indicators), the use of BoD-based country-specific importance weights enables each country to employ policies that are tailored to its own specific policy context. Given the nature of EU policy making with, on the one hand, a broadly shared EU-wide concern to strive for sustainable and inclusive economic growth (i.e., the core of the Europe 2020 Strategy) and, on the other hand, the different traditions and instruments to achieve this goal into being, which under the subsidiarity principle are still largely situated at the national level, the idea of ‘imposing’ some policy priority weighting scheme fits uneasily and, hence, is overly restrictive. Finally, as indicated by Cherchye, Moesen, Rogge, and Van Puyenbroeck, (2007), the dashboard approach currently used in EU policy-making and evaluation, with EU Member State performances being evaluated on the basis of individual indicators, dimension by dimension, almost inevitably faces policy-makers with the problem that one cannot comparatively judge Member States’ overall performance unless one aggregates the sub-indicators. The reason for this is that a Member State can be better than another Member State according to one (or some) sub-indicator(s), while the reverse holds for another (some other) sub-indicator(s). As is well-known, this problem is endemic when, as usual, more sub-indicators and/or more countries are taken into account.==== The case of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the evaluation and monitoring of 27 EU Member States on eight sub-indicators nicely illustrates this issue.==== Micklewright (2001) warns us of the danger that, lacking a good composite index, excessive public attention may eventually be again focused on just one or a few dimensions, thus abolishing the original desideratum of portraying a multidimensional phenomenon. Indeed, this could undermine the credibility of policy performance evaluation. A composite indicator does provide a summary of the aggregate performance of EU Member States in relation to the set of Europe 2020 sub-indicators. As such, a composite indicator forms a useful addition to the dashboard approach that is currently employed by the Commission.====A second important way in which Van Puyenbroeck and Rogge’s (2017) method deviates from the most traditional method is that it constructs composite indices as a ‘weighted geometric average’ instead of the ‘weighted arithmetic average’ (exceptions are Pasimeni, 2012, 2013; Pasimeni & Pasimeni, 2015). The reason for doing this is the recent findings and discussions in the CI-literature that the weighted geometric average is superior to the weighted arithmetic average aggregation procedure (see, e.g., Ebert & Welsch, 2004; Van Puyenbroeck & Rogge, 2017; Zhou, Ang & Zhou, 2010). There are several advantages to using weighted geometric averages, over the commonly used ‘weighted arithmetic average’. The first advantage is that the subsequent ordering we attain is independent of the scaling used for each of the statistical indicators, if we use solely ratio-scale measurement for strictly positive statistical indicators (as in the present case study) (see, Ebert & Welsch, 2004). In other words, the fact that the Europe 2020 Strategy indicators have different measurement units will not influence the ranking of the different countries when using the weighted geometric averages. The second advantage is that the weighted geometric average does not allow for perfect substitutability between the different sub-indicators, contrary to the traditional weighted arithmetic average. This means that it is no longer possible for a country to perfectly compensate for a poor performance in one sub-indicator with a better performance in another sub-indicator. Finally, because the weighted geometric average imposes that marginal returns to increases in a sub-indicator value are diminishing, it takes imbalances among sub-indicator values into account. Hence, countries with a more unbalanced performance on the set of Europe 2020 sub-indicators will receive lower CI-scores, all else being equal. The traditional weighted arithmetic average, on the other hand, is neutral as to such imbalances as it presumes constant marginal returns to increases in a sub-indicator value.====This paper hopes to answer several questions. In the period 2008–2014, have EU Member States been progressing towards the targets set out by the Europe 2020 Strategy, and if so, which countries are showing the best performances?==== Are there any EU Member States that have already reached their targets? Are certain policy areas showing more improvement than others? The added value of this paper lies mostly in its scope. Most researchers focus only on one or two domains of the Europe 2020 Strategy (Barslund, 2012; Dragomirescu-Gaina, Elia, & Weber, 2015). By considering all eight sub-indicators and sub-targets of the Europe 2020 Strategy simultaneously in a performance evaluation of Member States, this paper hopes to give a broader overview of the dynamics in the performances of the EU Member States with respect to their targets.",EU countries’ progress towards ‘Europe 2020 strategy targets’,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300237,March–April 2019,2019,Research Article,331.0

Increased sensitivity in recent years to rising ==== rate. These results are to be seen as long-run effects for economies at potential output.","Rising pressure on the welfare state due to aging, forces governments in all OECD countries to develop effective employment and growth policies. In all countries, and especially in those with poor labor market performance, the challenge is mainly to raise employment among low educated individuals and among older individuals. As we show in Fig. 1 for a cross-section of OECD countries in 2016, it is among these two groups of individuals that by far the most progress can (and must) be made. While employment rates for prime age and high educated individuals are between 80% and 90% in most of these countries, they are generally (far) below 75% for older and low educated individuals. Moreover, Fig. 2 highlights the importance for aggregate performance of getting at work individuals without a higher secondary degree and individuals older than 50. It is exactly in countries like Sweden and Norway that are relatively successful in activating the ‘weaker’ groups, that aggregate employment rates are the highest. By contrast, in countries like Belgium and France, where employment among the ‘weaker’ groups is relatively low, also aggregate employment is low. Correlation equals 0.56 in the left panel of Fig. 2. It is even 0.66 in the right panel. Only Italy somewhat disturbs the picture.====Concern for employment is not new, however. It has been high on the agenda of both policy makers and researchers since at least two decades. Many researchers have demonstrated the major influence of the composition of fiscal policy on aggregate employment, both in general equilibrium models (e.g. Dhont & Heylen, 2008; Ohanian, Raffo, & Rogerson, 2008; Prescott, 2004; Rogerson, 2007) and in econometric panel data studies (e.g. Bassanini & Duval, 2006; Berger & Heylen, 2011). In more recent general equilibrium models with overlapping generations, Rogerson and Wallenius (2009), Ludwig, Schelkle, and Vogel (2012), Heylen and Kerckhove (2013) and Wallenius (2013) for example, also pay attention to life cycle patterns in labor supply and to employment differences across age groups. Erosa, Fuster, and Kambourov (2012) focus particularly on the influence of taxes and social security programs on labor supply late in the life cycle and on the retirement decision of older workers. Much less attention has been paid, however, to the employment performance of low educated workers, and the related cross-country differences. The main reason is that the above mentioned general equilibrium models explaining aggregate employment and employment over the life cycle assume equal ability and capacity to build human capital for all people.==== This makes it hard for these existing models to answer questions not only about productive efficiency (output, employment), but also about equity. Increasing sensitivity in recent years to the problem of inequality has, however, brought exactly the questions about equity to the forefront, making the challenge for policy makers only larger. Not only efficiency, but also equity demands attention.====Our aim and contribution in this paper is an analysis of the impact of the composition of fiscal policy on employment (hours worked) of individuals with different ability and different age in an overlapping generations model for an open economy. The same model has recently been used for an analysis of alternative reforms of the public pension system by Buyse, Heylen, and Van de Kerckhove (2017). Next to employment, the model allows to study human capital accumulation, the retirement decision of older workers, per capita income, and welfare. The fiscal government in our model sets tax rates on labor, capital and consumption, and allocates its revenue to consumption, pensions and non-employment benefits, including early retirement benefits. To concretize heterogeneity in abilities, we define in each generation individuals who are born with high, medium or low innate ability. Individuals with higher ability enter the model with more human capital. They are also more productive in building additional human capital when they allocate time to (tertiary) education. Individuals with low ability enter the model with low human capital and have zero productivity to study and build additional human capital.==== This extension allows a richer and more realistic analysis of fiscal policy effects. Labor taxes and benefits may differ not only by the age of workers, but also by their ability (earned labor income). Moreover, in addition to aggregate income and welfare effects of policy changes, it will be possible to investigate income and welfare effects for specific age or ability groups. A discussion then becomes possible of the effects of policies on both intragenerational and intergenerational inequality.====Our main findings are the following. First, we confirm some of our key results in Heylen and Van de Kerckhove (2013). We identify labor taxes and (especially) non-employment benefits as the most effective policy variables with respect to employment. Again, we observe that labor tax cuts targeted at older workers are far more effective than overall labor tax cuts. They have stronger employment effects. Moreover, they also promote human capital accumulation by individuals of high and medium ability and – as a consequence – productivity and output. Labor tax cuts targeted at young workers rather have the opposite effects. Second, however, a new result in this paper is that if labor tax cuts are targeted at older workers, this also implies clearly differential welfare effects between the ability groups. Current and near future low ability individuals may experience significant relative welfare losses. Third, as another new result, better overall employment effects and better welfare effects for low ability groups (implying reduced welfare inequality) are possible, if one supplements policies that cut labor taxes on older workers with labor tax cuts on all low-wage earners. The best effects on employment follow if this combined tax cut is financed by an overall reduction of non-employment benefits. An alternative financing option is to raise the consumption tax rate. These results are to be seen as long-run outcomes for economies at potential output.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 sets out our model. In Section 3 we briefly discuss the parameterization of the model. In Section 4 we confront the model’s predictions with some key facts in 11 OECD countries. We find that the model replicates important cross-country performance differences quite well. Section 5 includes the results of a wide range of policy simulations. In this section we discuss the employment, education, output and welfare effects of fiscal policy changes. We study effects per generation and per ability (income) group.

This leads to the question of how to proceed with ==== policy evaluations through rigorous macro models. In the economic literature, there are two major concerns on whether this can be done. The first one is the popular ‘Lucas critique’ (Lucas, 1976) and the second (and earlier) critique comes from Mises (1962) and several members of the Austrian school.====According to the Lucas critique, parameters estimated from a reduced-form model are directly related to the agents’ optimal decision rules and, indirectly, to the policies prevailing during the sampling period. Consequently, when counterfactual policies are analyzed with these estimates, there is no guarantee of parameter invariance since the individuals’ expectations and their corresponding decisions change. On the other hand, some members of the Austrian school, argue that theories are not falsifiable through empirical evidence because human actions lack constancy. Since humans’ purposes and motivations are not observed, and no physiological explanation can be offered; nothing can be said about how a person might react to certain policy. According to Israel (2016), human actions are contingent to their knowledge and beliefs. Hence, their learning process prevents the constancy principle required for the use of statistical relationships in the prescription and evaluation of public policies.====In our view, contemporary economists are much better equipped to deal with the Lucas critique and Mises’ constancy problem. On one hand, advances in experimental and behavioral economics, psychology and neuroeconomics provide a better understanding of human motivations and learning mechanisms (Bowles, 2017, Dhami, 2016). On the other, computational methods allow us to explicitly model adaptive processes such as the one through which governments reorganize their priorities as a response to policy outcomes.====In this paper, we differentiate social learning from two other popular causes of parameter instability: ==== and ====. Social learning is particularly salient in development economics, especially when the problem at hand involves corruption and budgetary allocations across different policy issues. We say that a ==== exists when the implementation of a policy induces certain collective behavior that, in turn, ‘nudges’ individuals to conform to a norm. The latter impinges on the policymaking process through the government’s response (adaptation) to policy outcomes.====Clearly, ==== evaluation is subject to how well economic models can account for collective behavior. For this reason, we advocate for the use of agent computing (also known as agent-based modeling).. In order to demonstrate the adequacy of this tool, we infer policy priorities and evaluate different prescriptions through a computational model by Castañeda, Chávez-Juárez, and Guerrero (2018). The model posits a political economy game where a government allocates resources to different policy issues, updating the allocation profile while a norm of corruption emerges among the officials in charge of implementing the public policies.====Our empirical results show that, on average, policies derived from this computational framework are better, in terms of gains in efficiency (====, lower corruption), than those neglecting social learning and endogenous government behavior. While this, of course, is not the only factor that improves efficiency, it seems to be more important than being disciplined when adopting a recommendation (lack of discipline is often used as an argument to defend failed prescriptions). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we discuss the problem of parameter instability through the social learning channel and the importance of modeling endogenous responses. Section 2 presents the model’s equations. Section 3 introduces the methods and metrics to be used in the empirical analysis. In Section 4, we show and interpret our main empirical findings.

This paper analyses the signaling role of over-education in Spain, a country characterised by a strongly-segmented labor market with high unemployment levels, and a large number of over-educated. Using micro data for a representative sample of Spanish workers, three different methods are applied to provide evidence that educational mismatch plays a clear signaling role. Policy implications are derived to alleviate inefficiencies in the allocation of educational resources and in the incentives of workers to use over-education as a signal.","In the literature of the economics of education, human capital and signaling theories are often advanced to explain the positive relationship between years of education (or credentials) and wages. If education is productivity-enhancing, then public funding of education is taken for granted (Annabi, 2017). By contrast, if education has only a signaling role, public expenditure on education is a waste of resources. Whereas the empirical consensus concludes that signaling may play a role, this is minimal compared with the productivity-enhancing role, and there is increasing evidence at the international level that a significant proportion of workers are employed in jobs requiring less education than they have obtained (OECD, 2011). This phenomenon of over-education is a matter of great interest in current research (see the meta-analyses by Groot & Maassen van den Brink, 2000; Rubb, 2003, and the surveys by Hartog, 2000; Leuven & Oosterbeek, 2011; McGuinness, 2006; Sloane, 2003). Whereas over-education is routinely considered to be suboptimal, a consequence of a mismatch due to search or job frictions, the increasing dispersion in ability and/or skills among equally-educated workers may induce individuals to voluntarily acquire more qualifications than those they can productively use in their jobs (McGuinness & Sloane, 2011).====The potential role of over-education as a signaling device has been frequently overlooked in the literature. This low interest stems from the general belief that over-education is a source of inefficiency and is a deviation from the rational behavior of individuals, since over-education entails lower wages than earned by equally-educated workers who are in properly-matched jobs. Under a signaling approach, however, over-education may be inefficient at the social level, but it may, in fact, stem from rational individual behavior. Less experienced or less able workers may over-educate to signal employers that they are indeed qualified for a job, to compensate for the lack of other skills or to disguise themselves among other equally-educated, but more able, individuals. Firms may find over-education useful in assessing the ranking of a particular individual on the ability spectrum (Green, McIntosh, & Vignoles, 2002), or as an indication of adaptive capacities (Lene, 2011). The signaling role of over-education may be especially important in periods of recession, and/or in areas where unemployment is high, since the decision to invest in education is not only regarded as a way to have access to higher wages but also as a way of insuring against unemployment (Arulampalam, 2001; Charlot, Decreuse, & Granier, 2005; Fernández, 2006). Albrecht and Vroman (2002) and Verhaest and Omey (2009) show that being unemployed produces a greater stigma than working at a job for which the individual is over-educated. Similarly, Iriondo and Pérez-Amaral (2016) argue that individuals who experience an involuntary job change and/or significant periods of unemployment are more likely to be over-educated.====In this context, the excess of education may constitute an additional waste of resources when it is publicly funded, with social returns being below private returns (Iriondo & Pérez-Amaral, 2016). Whether or not this is the case, policy measures aiming to reduce over-education – due to mismatch, mobility costs, or asymmetric information – may be insufficient if incentives for the voluntary acquisition by individuals of additional education remain. Additional policies should then be implemented in order to reduce the signaling role of over-education. The aim of this paper is to examine the possible role of signaling in the generalization of over-education in the Spanish labor market and the proposal of policies to alleviate the associated problems.====Spain is an interesting case study for several reasons. First, from an international perspective, the proportion of over-educated workers is among the highest within the OECD countries (using the statistical method, OECD (2011) shows that one third of workers in Spain are over-educated and one fourth are severely over-educated).==== Second, employment protection legislation has been quite restrictive, at least until the last labor reform in 2012,==== which generated a strongly-segmented market between permanent and temporary workers. The temporary rate has been the highest within the EU, above 30% until the onset of the Great Recession, generating a dual market and favoring the volatility of employment over time (Bentolila, Cahuc, Dolado, & Le Barbanchon, 2012).==== In this line, the Spanish unemployment rate has been consistently among the highest within the EU for decades, and has risen to values over 25% during the Great Recession. Third, returns to education are low compared to many EU countries (De la Fuente & Jimeno 2009) and they have declined over time (Felgueroso, Hidalgo-Perez, & Jiménez-Martín, 2016; Izquierdo & Lacuesta 2012; Murillo, Rahona, & Salinas, 2012). All of this suggests an interest in studying the potential signaling role of over-education in Spain.====An initial challenge is how to define over-education and how to measure it. We must first distinguish between over-education/educational mismatch and skill mismatch; and, second, we must specify how both types of mismatch are measured. As explained below, we use subjective indicators of education and skill mismatch, which are dictated by data availability. Specifically, our data comes from a representative national sample of Spanish workers combining objective information relative to personal and job/related characteristics, and subjective information on educational mismatch, working conditions, and attitudes towards work.====We test the signaling role of over-education using three alternative methods; first, by comparing the returns to education between different groups of workers and different degrees of mismatch; second, by analyzing the attitude of workers to their educational mismatch; and, finally, by using an exogenous variation in educational legislation. With respect to the first method, we adapt the methodology in Wolpin (1977) and Riley (1979), and divide our samples into screened (wage earners) and unscreened workers (self-employed), and then compare their rates of return. While the returns to over-education of the screened may be rewarding in both productivity gains and educational signs, those of the unscreened are purely due to productivity gains, so that the differences may be interpreted as revealing the signaling value of over-education; if differences are negligible, over-education has no signaling role. We carry out separate estimates for different types of educational and skill mismatch, as discussed below. Additionally, we control for selectivity into employment status and skill heterogeneity.====The second approach includes different exercises exploring a common idea: how well the over-educated feel at the workplace and their willingness to move to other jobs. Our hypothesis is as follows. When individuals are over-educated, and probably not very satisfied in the current job, then they would search for another job in which they are not over-educated and more satisfied. This transitory stage in over-education would point to an absence of signaling. The third exercise consists of a natural experiment based on a change in educational legislation, derived from the implementation of a new education law in academic year 1991–92 (====, LOGSE, passed in 1990) that replaced a previous one (====, LGE, 1970). The key aspect of the new law is the extension of compulsory education from 14 to 16 years old. Our hypothesis is that, if individuals over-educate to signal, an extension in compulsory schooling would likely see an increase in over-education, since more years in non-compulsory schooling are now necessary to be able to launch a credible signal. Furthermore, the implementation of LOGSE took place at different times across the Spanish regions, which provides exogenous regional variations in which to test whether over-education increased after the inception of the new law.====Our results show that returns to over-education in those groups in which signaling is unimportant (the self-employed) are lower. We interpret this as showing a signaling role of over-education. Nevertheless, the over-educated are found to be less job-satisfied and more prone to search for another job, indicating that they would prefer a job with a better match. Job satisfaction and willingness to change the job depend on the type of educational mismatch. Individuals we label as genuinely over-educated are less satisfied and more eager to move than those who are identified as apparently over-educated, so that the signaling role of over-education may vary across different groups of individuals. Finally, our natural experiment finds that the inception of the new law conveys a positive effect on over-education, which again supports the validity of the signaling role of over-education. In this context, we discuss a range of sources for the role of over-education as a signal and what kind of policies would be helpful in reducing its effects. In general, education policies should aim to reduce the asymmetric information firms face when hiring new workers, such as abilities or skills, or institutional quality and fields of study. Further, pursuing a better adjustment between what the labor market demands and what workers supply, seems a reasonable objective. General labor market policies that strive for a reduction in unemployment, in fixed-term and in part-time contracts, and those reinforcing not only more and better education, but also the acquisition of appropriate skills, would reduce the need for individuals to obtain additional unproductive education.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a summary of the literature and Section 3 describes the data and the concept of mismatch used to study the signaling role of over-education. In Section 4, we study the returns to education, comparing wage earners with the self-employed. Section 5 analyses the relationship between educational mismatch and job satisfaction, job search, and job mobility. Section 6 uses the change in the educational law in 1990 as a natural experiment for studying the evolution of over-education. Finally, Section 7 concludes.",The signalling role of over-education and qualifications mismatch,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300225,January–February 2019,2019,Research Article,334.0

Using the large panel data of the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Surveys, the objectives are twofold: (i) to evaluate the micro-impact of microcredit on rural household economy, particularly on output value and net income of rural households, using Matched Difference-in-Difference method; and (ii) to evaluate its macro-impact on economic growth, especially the aggregate effect of production increase and income growth, using Input–Output analysis. The results at micro level find that microcredit benefits self-employment rather than other economic activities of households. The salient results from the macro-economic analysis reveal that, not as expected, the effect of microcredit on output increase is not so large. The findings suggest that microcredit is an effective development strategy at both micro and macro levels, thus the Vietnamese government should enact the relevant policies to enhance the effectiveness and outreach of microcredit.","Poverty reduction, which is the top concerned among 17 Sustainable Development Goals, attracts the attention of every country, especially the developing countries. Vietnam is one of few countries that have obtained the remarkable achievements in poverty reduction and economic growth. In particular, poverty rate has declined from 37.4% in 1998 to 17.2% in 2012 (Demombynes & Vu, 2015). However, a large number of rural households in Vietnam are still living in poverty and suffering from the lack of developmental opportunities, of which limited access to funds is a critical obstacle (Duong & Izumida, 2002; Duong & Thanh, 2014).====The preponderance of theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence suggests a positive, first-order relationship between financial development and economic growth (Levine, 1997). Financial development reflected by total credit to private sector is also proved to make a remarkable contribution to long-run growth process (Jedidia, Boujelbène, & Helali, 2014). In developing countries, credit plays an important role in agriculture and rural development. (Duong & Izumida, 2002). At micro level, credit can help the rural households, including the poor and the less advantaged, to improve their income or at least smooth their consumption (Duong & Izumida, 2002; Morduch & Haley, 2002). However, the poor normally have difficulties in accessing to formal credit sources (Brau & Woller, 2004). In addition, the poor in the developing countries have more difficulties in accessing than those in the developed countries. In Vietnam, many poor households, especially those in remote areas, the minority ethnic groups, or those operating in high-risk fields, normally face difficulties in accessing to formal credit. They always have high demand for credit (Duong & Izumida, 2002) but cannot borrow from semi-formal and formal credit sources due to the lack of collateral assets. Microcredit is designed as a collateral-free credit services and established to serve the poor, and thereby it can increase the poor’ accessibility to formal credit. Microcredit is defined as a small loan granted to the poor so that they can run production or do business to generate income and improve their well-being.====Microcredit is an effective tool for the goal of welfare improvement and poverty reduction via generating employment, increasing income and consumption (Khandker, 1998; Khandker & Koolwal, 2015; Li, Gan, & Hu, 2011; Mahjabeen, 2008; Yunus, 2003). Some studies, however, argue that microcredit has no effect on living standards and no immediate poverty-reducing impact in a short-term, or only benefits the less-poor households (Coleman, 1999, 2006; Hulme & Mosley, 1996; Takahashi et al., 2010). Empirical studies in Vietnam also confirm mixed results on the impact of microcredit. Some find the significant role of microcredit in improving household income, consumption or self-employment profits, contributing to the poverty alleviation and insuring against health shocks (Cuong, 2008; Duong & Thanh, 2014; Lensink & Pham, 2012; Phan, Gan, Nartea, & Cohen, 2014; Thanh & Duong, 2017), while some conclude no impact of microcredit on income (Phan et al., 2014).====Farm households are typically rational in decision-making process. Moreover, due to the constraint in intra-household resources, the farmers may choose the appropriate income-generating activities to optimize their benefit. Credit is fungible and thereby credit borrowed for non-farm activities can be diverted to other income-generating activities such as agriculture (Khandker & Koolwal, 2015) and ====. Therefore, it is of interest and importance to examine the causal effect of microcredit on various income-generating activities. However, very few studies investigate the impact of microcredit on different income sources. Therefore, the first aim of this paper is to examine the role of microcredit in improving income and output value from such activities as agriculture, self-employment, common property resources and wage. To capture better results, this paper applies Matched Difference-in Difference (Matched DID or PSM-DID) to investigate the micro-impact of microcredit.====Despite many empirical studies examining the micro-impact of microcredit on poverty and welfare at a household level, surprisingly little is known about its macro-impact. Among few, Maksudova (2010) shows the Granger causality from microfinance to economic growth using Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX) data. Buera, Kaboski, and Shin (2012), Mahjabeen (2008) and Raihan, Osmani, and Khalily (2017) employ Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for evaluating aggregate and distributional impact of microfinance targeted to small business, impact on household consumption and welfare, and show the existence of macro-impact. In addition, there have been few studies in Vietnam using Input–Output (IO) model to analyze the relationship between economic activities and water pollution (Le, Tokai, & Yamamoto, 2012), the effects of equalization programs on national economic outcomes and industries (Le, Cabalu, & Salim, 2014) or effects of trade liberalization (Chan, Dung, Ghosh, & Whalley, 2005). To our best knowledge, neither studies methodologically apply Input–Output (IO) model for evaluating macroeconomic effect of microcredit. Therefore, as for the second aim, we use econometric results on the impact of microcredit at household level, and then evaluate the macroeconomic effect, especially the increase in outputs, by using Input–Output (IO) analysis. The comprehensive assessment of microcredit impacts at both micro and macro levels and policy recommendations proposed to encourage the development of microcredit in Vietnam could also be useful for other similar developing countries.====The remainders of the paper are organized as follows. Section 2 introduces methods used for analyzing the micro- and macro-impact of microcredit. Section 3 describes data information. Section 4 present results and discussion. Section 5 concludes the paper with some brief policy implications.",Impact of microcredit on rural household welfare and economic growth in Vietnam,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300109,January–February 2019,2019,Research Article,335.0

Labeling results in increased costs for nanofood producers (the ==== of the labeling policy), reduced consumer uncertainty regarding the nature of the food product (====), and can affect consumer attitudes towards nanofoods by being perceived as a warning signal (====). In this context, nanofood labeling can change the perceived quality differences between nanofoods and their conventional and organic counterparts, with such changes being more salient when the ==== is large, when consumers have low awareness of food nanotechnology in the absence of labeling, and/or when competition among nanofood suppliers is more intense. Despite its empirical relevance, the impact of a labeling policy on consumer preferences (and the economic ramifications of such impact) has largely been ignored by the theoretical literature on the economics of labels. Our analysis shows that it matters. Specifically, our study shows that the market and welfare effects of labeling are case-specific and dependent on consumer awareness of, and attitudes towards food nanotechnology before ==== after the introduction of the policy as well as the relative magnitude of the ====, ==== and ==== on nanofoods.","A major goal of food labeling policies is the reduction of information asymmetries inherent in food markets. The provision of information on food labels about product attributes, especially credence attributes such as production methods (e.g., organic, conventional, genetically modified), can be useful to uninformed consumers. Consumer reaction to the labeling policy can determine the effectiveness of the policy and its market and welfare impacts. Empirical research has shown that the labeling policy can alter consumer preferences towards the labeled product/attribute. Despite its empirical relevance, however, the potential impact of food labeling on consumer preferences has been ignored by the theoretical literature on the economics of labeling (for a comprehensive review of this literature see Bonroy and Constantatos (2015)). In this study we show that the effect of labeling on consumer preferences matters and cannot be a matter of indifference.====We examine the economic effects of labeling food nanotechnology products, commonly referred to as nanofoods. A nanofood is food that has been cultivated, produced, processed or packaged using nanotechnology techniques/tools or to which engineered nanomaterials have been added (Sekhon, 2010). There is rapid growth of the use of nanotechnology in consumer products==== and an increasing trend in its use in the agricultural and food sectors with the development of products and applications that could impact food quality and food safety.==== According to the PEN inventory, 117 manufacturer-identified nanofood products were on the market by July 2014 (PEN, 2014).==== Interestingly, none of these products, had to be labeled as a nanofood at that point in time.====Currently, with the exception of the EU where mandatory labeling of nanotechnology products took effect in December of 2014,==== no other country mandates the labeling of food nanotechnology products.==== Major impediments to labeling have been disagreements on the definition of nanofoods for regulatory purposes (Fletcher & Bartholomaeus, 2011) and the lack of appropriate risk assessment (Cushen, Kerry, Morris, Cruz-Romero, & Cummins, 2012). On this latter point, uncertainty exists regarding the risks of nanotechnology which include the potential toxicity of nanoparticles and their effect on humans and the environment (Cushen et al., 2012).====The lack of nanofood labeling until recently could explain, at least in part, why the vast majority of participants in recent EU and US surveys reported knowing “nothing” or “a little” about (food) nanotechnology (IFIC, 2012; European Commission, 2010; Food Safety News, 2010; Kahan, 2009; Tran, Yiannaka, & Giannakas, 2019). The rising number of nanofood products in the market, combined with the lack of scientific consensus regarding the health and environmental risks of nanotechnology and low public awareness towards food nanotechnology have given rise to a policy debate as to whether labeling should be imposed. On the one hand, proponents of labeling point to the need of protecting the right of consumers to be informed and warn that lack of transparency may create a backlash for the food nanotechnology sector if the public perceives the withholding of information to imply that the technology has undesirable or harmful consequences. Brown and Kuzma (2013) find that US consumers are willing to pay for nanofood labeling as a means of avoiding risk, even when the risk is perceived to be minimal. In contrast, skeptics of the labeling regulation are concerned that the designation of “nano” on food labels might hinder the acceptability of nanotechnology by consumers who might perceive it as a warning that nano-ingredients or nano-materials are intrinsically harmful, even when such risks are not scientifically validated (Gruere, 2011; Siegrist, 2008). Siegrist and Keller (2011) support this argument in a study showing that nanotechnology labels resulted in an increase of perceived risks and a reduction of perceived benefits compared to no labeling.====An adverse consumer response to nanofood labeling might hinder the adoption of food nanotechnology by producers and/or processors under a mandatory labeling regime and could discourage voluntary labeling when labeling is not mandated. The recent implementation of mandatory nanofood labeling in the EU has implications for firms operating in as well as those exporting to the EU market. Despite the significant and rising interest in the ramifications of a nanofood labeling regime, there has been, to our knowledge, no systematic analysis of its market and welfare impacts.====This paper addresses this issue and develops a framework of heterogeneous consumers and imperfectly competitive suppliers to examine the effects of the introduction of nanofood labeling on (a) equilibrium prices and quantities of conventional, organic and nanofood products, and (b) the welfare of the interest groups involved (i.e., consumers and suppliers of nanofoods and their conventional and organic counterparts). Different scenarios regarding consumer attitudes towards nanofoods under a no labeling regime and the potential for change in attitudes due to the introduction of nanofood labels are considered within this framework. Our analysis shows that the effect of labeling on consumer preferences matters as it affects the market and welfare impacts of the nanofood labeling policy. In providing a better understanding of the market and welfare impacts of the labeling policy, our analysis could assist policy makers in the design/determination of a regulatory response that is consistent with their goals and objectives as they relate to food nanotechnology and the welfare of the interest groups involved.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the model, Section 3 derives market outcomes under no labeling of food nanotechnology, Section 4 analyses the market and welfare impacts of the introduction of nanofood labels, and Section 4 discusses policy implications and concludes the paper.",An economic analysis of nanofood labeling,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300031,January–February 2019,2019,Research Article,336.0

The contribution of international tourism development to empower women is the key initiative of the developed world to provide an equal opportunity to the women to sustain their livelihoods. This study focused on the role of international tourism development on women empowerment through mediating a number of financial factors in a panel of 24 selected European countries, over a period of 1990–2015. The results show that financial intermediaries act as a catalyst to empower women through international tourism. More specifically, tourism and financial factors promote (i) gender parity in tertiary enrollment, (ii) gender parity in primary and secondary school enrollment, (iii) female employment, and (iv) women’s share in non-agriculture wage employment, while the results further support the (i) growth-led tourism, (ii) finance-led growth, (iii) growth stimulate women empowerment, and (iv) tourism-induced women’s empowerment hypothesis across countries.","The 17-point agenda of United Nations sustainable development goals is the vital factor to promote global peace and harmony. The Goal-5 for gender equality and women empowerment is considerable important for transformation our world through providing equal opportunity of boys and girls for getting education and employment. It is evident that the Goal-5 agenda is suffered in almost every part of the world, which embarrassed the sustainable development goals in the civilized world (United Nations, 2016). The contribution of international tourism development to empower women is the key initiative of the developed world to provide an equal opportunity to the women to sustain their livelihoods (UNWTO, 2008).====It is evident that gender inequality hinders the development process, which is the core component of political agenda to device long-term policies that give favor the female more than its male counterpart. Tourism sector played a vital role in order to reduce gender inequalities by providing access to women to participate in economic activities, access to the resources, and opportunities to get more jobs in this sector with dignity (UNWTO, 2010). The seminal work of Boserup (1970) concluded that women should have to include in developmental agenda to get out from suffering, as women are marginalized in every walk of life due to male biased society, low freedom of voice and getting low earning. Robeyns (2003) argued that for judicious income distribution, it is necessary to include women in the development agenda. Klasen (2002) concluded that gender inequality largely hurts the country’s economic development through the channel of providing average human capital. Klasen and Lamanna (2009) found that gender disparity in education and employment leads negative impact on country’s long-term growth, while Juhn, Ujhelyi, & Villegas-Sanchez (2014) emphasized the need of technology up gradation at firm level that favors more to the female workers as compared to their blue collar male worker.====Women in development process are largely provoked in feminist work, which highlighted the needs of women for inclusion in policy agenda through integrated development process. This channel direct supports women in terms of creating more jobs and income, which under fall the system of women’s human right. However, the United Nation agenda for gender equality and women empowerment through tourism has no directly connections unless and until there would be some donors that committed to reduce women disparity in labor market or in education sector to promote feminist based tourism across the globe (Ferguson, 2011). The United Nation provoked for women empowerment through tourism development in its fifth sustainable development goals and dictated world for ‘tourism opens doors for women’, which further officially launched global report on women in the tourism in 2010 that considered one of the fundamentals to include women in the policy agenda. UNWTO set an action plan for empowering women through tourism by involving stakeholders’ taskforce for promoting women through international campaigns, knowledge sharing, and promoting equality in the tourism sector (UNWTO, 2011).====The literature on tourism has claimed poverty reduction and economic growth as its consequences, and is well recognized in policy circles (Ferguson, 2011). However, how tourism development has contributed in achieving third millennium goals (MDG3) has not been shedding light frequently in terms of policy discourse and academics. The MDG3 focuses on the issues of gender inequality and empowering women (UNWTO, 2015). This study argues that tourism development has full potential to contribute towards women empowerment. The earlier studies on the topic of tourism and tourism development concentrated on how this industry habitually browbeaten colonial family and turned to colonial power structures to construct and promote industry in less developed countries (Nash, 1989). Therefore, to overcome the exploitative dimensions of tourism in less developed countries, researchers turned their attention to alternative forms of tourism (Khan, 1997). Studies on alternative forms of tourism suggested that there exists no habitual association between “new tourism” and “ecotourism” (Duffy, 2004, Mowforth and Munt, 2008). Targeting the benefits of tourism towards ‘poverty reduction', ‘pro-poor tourism' approach was introduced (Brown & Hall, 2008). Nevertheless, this approach has not been discussed in any substantive way, though this approach facilitate to strengthening inequalities without considering the global political economy.====Pro-poor tourism approach is important as it sheds light on gender aspects of inequality entrenched to the tourism policy and tourism industry. A number of studies, approaches and case studies have addressed that tourism is a highly gendered activity (Dumbreaveanu, Light, Young, & Chapman, 2016; Ferguson, 2011, Lenao and Basupi, 2016; Saarinen, Rogerson, & Manwa, 2011; Scheyvens, 2000). The work on the topic of gender and tourism covered tourism, gender and sex industry. Work on the tourism and sex aspect of the gender is an ongoing issue (Jeffreys, 2008), but the assumption that all the work on this topic should be related to the sexual exploitation is wrong as there are other aspects of gender and tourism such as empowering women.====The roots of ‘women’s social and economic empowerment’ in academics can be tracked back in 70s, when Boserup (1970) argued that, women's are lacking in vocational training and under-educated though they make up half of the adult population of the developing countries. Therefore, they are provided with insufficient representation in the workplace and are confined to semi-skilled, unskilled and low-paid jobs. Stepping towards development, women’s were traditionally transferred to public or private sector institutions. More specifically, women are pushed into the human resources where they need training. Thus, development requires a noteworthy contribution from women (Hoque and Itohara, 2009, van Klaveren and Tijdens, 2012). Infact, there should be an increased involvement by women in the economy for social and economic empowerment. Boserup (1986), after sixteen years of her first publication confirmed that the conditions (i.e. for women working) had not yet improved in developing countries. So far, a number of models regarding women empowerment have been suggested, but little has been highlighted about what empowerment means (Eyben and Napier-Moore, 2009, Jutting and Morrisson, 2005). Tegland (2008) included high quality of life in respect of freedom, health or knowledge in the definition of empowerment. Sen (1999) also talked about freedom and the ability to take decisions. Women were deprived in social and economic realms, however, Hovorka (2014) suggested empowering women through urban agriculture. Economic empowerment might lead women’s control over capital, land, productive resources, income parity with men, entrepreneurial opportunities and jobs away from home (Stanistreet, Swami, Pope, Bambra, & Scott-Samuel, 2007). In addition, social empowerment was also ignored that include reproduction control, domestic slavery, improvement in societal laws and other institutions, safety and educational opportunities (Jutting & Morrisson, 2005: van Klaveren & Tijdens, 2012).====Later, psychological and political empowerment has also been added. Inclusion of women in authority and positions of power, female suffrage, access to political representation and control over decision-making includes political empowerment (Stanistreet et al., 2007). Whereas, sense of confidence and ability to meet the challenges include psychological empowerment (Zimmerman, 1990). According to Chhetri and Lama (2013), UNWTO has fully focused on empowering women through tourism as it is one of the tools that truly empower women. Mahjabeen (2008) concluded that micro financing is one of the viable economic activity that substantially reduces income inequality and poverty, while it raises household’s income and consumption, economic welfare, and achieve MDGs. Wattanakuljarus and Coxhead (2008) found that international tourist arrival raises high economic activities in the form of increasing aggregate household income, however, it largely worsen the distribution pattern across countries.====The tourism sector, like other sectors, is surrounded by the global dynamics of inequality. Studies on tourism have confirmed a clear segmentation of women’s and men’s work, where women's work is mostly related to low-paid activities such as cleaning, hospitality and retail (Sinclair, 1997). Moreover, the literature on tourism has criticized the employment conditions in local and international hotel chains. Specifically, from a gender perspective, these conditions are even worse. The tourism industry is characterized by seasonal related employment; therefore, employers have created a pool of temporary workers for day-to-day operations. The International Labor Organization (ILO) argued that 46% of the women in tourism sector works on wage globally. According to the report of ILO (2001, p.74), “Women occupy the lower levels of the occupational structure in the tourism labour market, with few career development opportunities and low levels of remuneration. They also tend to be the first affected when labour retrenchment occurs as a result of recession or adjustment to new technology”. Therefore, there is a need to understand the tourism sector in terms of work inequalities as such inequalities affect status, power and relative income of the workers specifically women (because they belong to part time job) (Sinclair, 1997).====The emerging research in the field of informal aspects of tourism like handicrafts (for the tourists) also reveals gender inequality. For example, Tucker (2007) concluded that, development of micro-business were of no beneficiary for the women’s of Turkey. However, the case if difference regarding tourism employment as Tinker (2006) noted a significant effect of tourism employment on women’s empowerment. There are many ways, using which women’s could enter into the paid workforce. For instance, Sinclair (1997) argued that women's working in the tourism sector not only enjoys better household status, but this also increases their bargaining power. It is believed that women are more suitable for household tasks and this has allowed a number of women of Belize to have their own guesthouses (Gentry, 2007). In Central America, women were found to empower themselves because of earning through tourism (Ferguson, 2010). Therefore, we argued that tourism development positively contribute towards MDG3 and finances among European countries. The other side of the coin in empowering women is the availability of micro-credit programs for women. The argument is that, capital allows women to start their entrepreneurial activities to contribute financially in communities and household (Koenig, Ahmed, Hossain, Khorshed, & Mozumder, 2003). Baliamoune-Lutz (2016) argued that foreign aid have a vital importance in order to enhance the womens’ political empowerment in MENA region. This economic empowerment is expected to enhance women empowerment to contribute to economic growth.====The above significant discussions confirm the long-run relationship between tourism development and women’s empowerment across the globe. The present study examined the long-run and causal relationship between tourism development and women’s empowerment under the premises of different financial intermediaries that act as a catalyst to amplify the tourism growth and translating its impact on women across Europe.",The impact of tourism and finance on women empowerment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893818301510,March–April 2019,2019,Research Article,337.0

This is important for policy purposes considering the increased importance of remittances as a source of external financing for sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, unlike in the past, it is now required that migrants transfer funds home through official channels (Adenutsi, Aziakpono, & Ocran, 2012) thereby impacting the formal financial system. If remittance levels complement financial sector development in sub-Saharan Africa (Gupta, Patillo, & Wagh, 2009), it becomes necessary to investigate whether remittance volatility has an impact as well.====The relevance of remittances is not only about the quantum of flows but also the volatility (Annen, Batu, & Kosempel, 2016). A better understanding of the consequences of remittance-receiving patterns – not only remittance levels – on the receiving economies will become more important in future years considering that the percentage of individuals living in countries other than those of their birth is rising (Amuedo-Dorantes & Pozo, 2012). The heightened interest in remittances is also because of the positive impact on financial sector development. For instance, managing the transfers of funds from abroad means dealing with new clients and this also implies the broadening and deepening of deposit mobilization by banks. Equally remittances can help augment domestic savings and investment via banks and develop capital markets. However, irregular and volatile flows can adversely impact financial sector development. Remittance flows when volatile can result in unpredicted sudden withdrawals by recipient households and reverse the potential savings within banks. Such irregularity can also cause banks and intermediaries to charge extreme transfer costs thereby disturbing the efficiency of the financial system. Imai, Gaiha, Ali, and Kaicker (2014) also found that although remittances improved economic performance, their volatility was found to be detrimental to growth.====African stock markets can benefit from remittance flows, but volatility of flows can also destabilize the markets. Intermediaries of increasing remittance flows must be wary of the possible adverse effects of volatile flows. It is evident from the discussions that remittance flows and their volatility pose series policy dilemmas and challenges with respect to financial sector development and macroeconomic stability. For developing economies where financial sector efficiency is relatively low further diminishing efficiency can cause significant instability issues. Despite this very few studies examine the effect of remittance volatility on both financial sector depth and efficiency from the perspective of banks and stock markets.====Although still smaller than official development assistance and foreign direct investment inflows, remittances to sub-Saharan Africa have gradually increased, having reached an estimated figure of approximately US$32 billion in 2013 (Aga & Martinez Peria, 2014). For instance, remittances have increased from 1.6% of GDP in 2006 (Gupta et al., 2009) to 4% of GDP in 2012 (Aga & Martinez Peria, 2014). Personal remittances were under US$5 billion at the turn of the century in sub-Saharan Africa. During the 2000s it would appear that remittances have increased in importance, with US$8.27 billion recorded in 2004 and a dramatic rise to US$19.98 billion in 2005. In 2008, remittances stood at US$28.03 billion before declining to US$26.79 billion in 2009, perhaps due to the global financial crisis. However, remittance flows picked up a rising trend again from 2010. Nigeria is by far the leading remittances recipient country in sub-Saharan Africa, with US$20.8 billion recorded in 2014. This figure represents approximately 70% of all personal remittances to sub-Saharan African countries. The next leading recipient countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2014 were Ghana with US$2.0 billion, Senegal with US$1.9 billion, Ethiopia with US$1.8 billion, and Kenya with US$1.4 billion (World Bank, 2016). Heightened quantum of flows in remittances to Africa shows that the potential impact on financial sector development is significant and worth investigating. From a policy perspective such inquiry will help shape and craft appropriate policies to harness the full and beneficial influence of remittance flows. For instance, several sub-Saharan African economies have started raising extensive external financing at lower interest rates and longer maturities through the securitization of future remittance flows (Jidoud, 2015).====This study distinguishes between the effect of remittance volatility on financial sector depth and financial sector efficiency. Most studies within the remittances-financial development nexus focused on one characteristic of financial development (financial depth) while this study extends this to include financial sector efficiency. The study further contributes to the literature by not only focusing on the financial development of banks but also investigating the impact of remittances and remittance volatility on stock markets.====The rest of this study is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the relevant literature with Section 3 detailing the methodology employed in the empirical analysis.

For instance, inflation projections are a key input for monetary policy decision making, particularly under inflation targeting regimes, given that price stability is typically a main objective, as for the Eurosystem, or a prominent one, as is the case of the Federal Reserve System. Moreover, from a fiscal policy perspective, inflation has an impact on short-term and long-term government borrowing rates and, thus, affects the level and dynamics of public debt. Furthermore, expected inflation has an impact on nominal asset prices and inflation volatility affects the inflation risk-free rate. Moreover, effects on real interest rates also matter for investment and saving decisions of private and public agents. Finally, consumption decisions or wage negotiations depend on expected inflation.====Inflation projection targeting is based on the principle that, given a long-term objective for the inflation rate, the central bank’s own projection of inflation is an optimal intermediate target, which allows the central bank to conduct monetary policy with the desired trade-off between deviations of inflation from target and deviations of output from potential. The reason that the inflation projection is an optimal intermediate target is that it embodies all the relevant information available to the central bank. This includes knowledge of the policymakers’ preferences with respect to the trade-off between deviations of inflation from target and output from potential and also the central bank’s view of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In this context, having accurate central bank projections of inflation is highly relevant for the efficient conduct of monetary policy, since low quality projections may lead to inappropriate policy choices that may lead inflation to be away from target and destabilize output. This general interest in inflation projections has been renewed in recent years,==== following the abrupt changes in global economies during the Great Recession and its aftermath.====In the case of the Eurosystem, the projections of inflation and other macroeconomic variables for the euro area and for the individual euro area countries play a highly relevant role in monetary policy decision-making as a tool for bringing together information on current and expected economic developments. As such, these projections, which are obtained using a bottom-up country approach, constitute a key element of the economic analysis of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy. Furthermore, the Spanish Central Bank releases inflation projections which play a relevant role in many economic decisions of private and public agents.====The structure of this paper is the following. In Section 2 we present the institutional framework regarding monetary policy and inflation in the euro area. In Section 3, we describe the procedures used by the Spanish Central Bank staff to project consumer price inflation. Section 4 is devoted to presenting some policy illustrations.

The options are the implementation of common standards, developed internationally or bilaterally, and mutual recognition. The empirical analysis is based on data from the German Standardization Panel. We identify three dimensions that determine firms’ preferences regarding the various harmonization solutions: (1) company-specific factors, such as size, ==== and motives to apply standards, (2) the competitive environment, i.e. the position vis-à-vis other market participants, and (3) the technological environment, i.e. the dynamics of the market the company operates in.","Since 2013, the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (USA), regions that account for more than one third of world trade, negotiate on the most economically significant regional free trade agreement in history – the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). With an export volume of 408 billion Euro,==== the US is one of the most important trading partners of the EU, and vice versa. In particular, it is the fourth biggest export market for Germany, which is an important justification for Trump’s America First policy (Stiglitz, 2018). Negotiations in the framework of TTIP focus on removing non-tariff barriers (NTBs),==== which act as impediment to trade and investment as confirmed in the meta-analysis performed by Li and Beghin (2012) despite severe methodological challenges related to their quantification (Fugazza & Maur, 2008). Germany as a heavily export-oriented country and business location for many firms with linkages across borders is expected to profit strongly from further integration of markets. Affected companies are provided with the opportunity to increase profits and consumers in both countries benefit from higher employment associated with trade liberalization. Consumers will not only gain from higher incomes due to a boost of employment, but also from lower prices and increased product variety (see for example Feenstra and Taylor, 2008, Krugman and Obstfeld, 2008). The European Commission estimates potential gains of TTIP to be 120 billion Euro for the EU economy, 90 billion Euro for the US economy and 100 billion Euro for the rest of the world (CEPR, 2013). Other studies take a critical look on existing literature and predict negative effects of TTIP in terms of losses in net exports, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and jobs (for example Capaldo, 2014). Garcia-Duran and Eliasson (2017) elaborate the controversy related to TTIP the assumptions behind the arguments. On the one hand, the main arguments in favour of TTIP emphasize the economic and geostrategic benefits expecting an increased US-EU combined market power vis-à-vis third countries. On the other hand, the main criticisms of TTIP focus on its alleged negative impact on product safety and public policies assuming that the EU will succumb to neoliberal American preferences. Although these assumptions do not necessarily contradict each other, the debate is less whether benefits outweigh costs and more whether such costs are probable, leaving the supporters with a defensive position driven by the public mobilization of the opponents on the trade agreement with the US as a very specific partner.====Nevertheless, the majority of economic studies concludes that the removal of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) in the framework of this agreement will result in increases in real income and trade on both sides of the Atlantic (for example Berden et al., 2009; CEPR, 2013, CEPR/BIS, 2013; Egger, Francois, Manchin, & Nelson, 2015; Felbermayr, Heid, Larch, & Yalcin, 2015; Plaisier, Mulder, Vermeulen, & Berden, 2012). They also point out the importance of harmonizing formal standards which define requirements for the production process, the design, as well as customer requirements for products and services, like health and safety. In the context of TTIP, three different harmonization solutions are subject of public debates: adaption of international standards, development of specific EU-US standards and mutual recognition of existing standards. According to the International Standards Organization (ISO), an international standard is a ‘document, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines, or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context’ (ISO, 2004, p. 1). The harmonization of standards can significantly contribute to eliminate NTMs. Uniform standards may be negotiated internationally or bilaterally. Another approach to integrate markets is mutual recognition of standards. Because European and US standards are considered to be equivalent, products can be freely traded, even if the technical requirements set by the country of destination are not fully met (European Union, 2008). Yet, no studies analyse the question how to remove barriers arising from standards in the framework of TTIP. In order to fill this research gap, we explore data from the German Standardisation Panel (German: Deutsches Normungspanel (DNP)) in 2013, a survey about standardisation activities and the application of standards conducted among German firms active in standardisation. In the special section of the questionnaire, companies were asked to assess the three harmonization solutions discussed in the context of TTIP. Companies’ responses reveal that companies involved in standardisation processes on average prefer complete harmonization through the adoption of international standards or mutual recognition of European and US standards over the development of bilateral standards. It is already clear that no one-size-fits-all solution exists in either the adoption of international standards or mutual recognition. TTIP negotiations will most likely result in sector-specific approaches. However, which solution strategy is preferred by whom and as to whether industry affiliation is actually the only factor that influences whether the adoption of uniform standards or mutual recognition is the optimal solution for the firms, is an open question. The study takes a step towards answering this question by exploring factors that influence firms’ preferences on the different options for the dismantling of barriers to export arising from standards.====As the harmonization solutions differ substantially in their implications for the standardisation activities of a company, firms’ preferences on the respective option may vary depending on company characteristics. Within the theoretical part of our exploratory analysis we derive six propositions on the expected effects based on a review of the existing literature, which is quite limited. The prepositions are tested empirically based on data of the DNP, which are introduced in Chapter 3. The analysis is based on data from multivariate probit estimation using simulated maximum likelihood is applied to control for possible correlations between firm’s preferences. Our results, presented in Section 4, indicate that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution for the harmonization of standards. Confirming the theoretical predictions for equally competitive countries, German firms perceive significant benefits through full harmonization of standards with the US. Mutual recognition is expected to integrate markets quickly and to promote profits from product differentiation. Development of specific EU-US standards combines the advantages of international standards and mutual recognition and, consequently, is a harmonization solution with great potential which has not received sufficient attention.

Results from fixed-effects estimations suggest that exporting to developed economies enhances the sophistication of exports in the exporting country but there are ,"A country’s sophistication of production (and exports) is important for its economic transformation (Hausmann, Hwang, & Rodrik, 2007; ACET, 2014), as sophisticated production is generally associated with higher productivity, which in turn can lead to higher wages and incomes and improved wellbeing.====In an insightful recent study, Brambilla, Depetris-Chauvin, and Porto (2015) develop a theoretical framework and use it along with firm and industry-level data from developing countries to explore the potential gains from export opportunities and identify the channels through which trade effects operate. The results obtained by the authors support a causal link between export destination and higher wages in the sense that “industries that ship products to high-income destinations do pay higher average wages.” In addition, the study shows that industries that export to high-income countries export higher-quality products and use higher-wage skilled labor more intensively.====Baliamoune-Lutz (2011) performs Arellano–Bond GMM estimations on African panel data for the period 1995–2008 and examines the growth effects of Africa’s trade with China and developed (OECD) countries, controlling for the role of export concentration and distinguishing between the effect of imports and the effect of exports. The author did not find any evidence that exports to China lead to higher growth in African countries unconditionally, while the results of her study indicate that export concentration enhances the growth effects of exporting to China. This last result suggests that countries which export one major commodity to China benefit more than do countries that have more diversified exports. On the other hand, the author finds that “contrary to the widely held view that increasing imports from China would have a negative effect, the empirical results show that the share of China in a country’s total imports has a robust positive effect on growth.” In addition, and related to the issue we address in this paper, Baliamoune-Lutz (2011) obtains results suggesting that there is an inverted-U relationship between exports to developed countries and growth in Africa. The author concludes that the empirical results of her study support the proposition of ‘growth by destination’, that is, the destination of a country’s exports matters for the exporting country’s growth and development.====Both these studies point to the importance of the destination of exports. More specifically, developing countries’ exports to developed economies seem to have positive impacts on income growth (Baliamoune-Lutz, 2011) and on wages and skill premia (Brambilla et al., 2015; and also Brambilla, Lederman, & Porto, 2012). The induced skill upgrading may be a key channel through which trade can influence production and export sophistication and possibly income. In addition, Mendoza (2010) also argues that “whom you trade with matters, as richer and more technologically advanced trading partners offer more scope for trade-induced learning.”====This paper aims to draw on these studies and look into the impact of trade with developed countries on export sophistication, at the macroeconomic level, using data from a group of developing countries. The main hypothesis we test is whether exports to developed countries have a positive effect on the sophistication of the exporting country’s products. This question is highly pertinent given the significantly growing export flows from developing countries (African countries in particular) to China and other emerging markets. Exploring the effects of exports to developed countries on export sophistication in developing countries can potentially make a significant contribution to research on the impact of trade policies on wages and employment gains in developing economies, especially by providing macro-level empirical evidence.====We use fixed-effects estimation on macro-level panel data from a large group of developing and emerging economies and examine the impact of exporting to developed economies on export sophistication. Export sophistication is represented by UNCTAD’s index of comparative diversification vis-à-vis developed countries, which measures ====.====The empirical results suggest that exporting to developed economies is associated with higher export sophistication but with diminishing returns. We identify an inverted-U effect with the turning point occurring at a share of exports to developed countries of approximately 53%. In addition, we find that the interplay of exports to developed countries with the exporting country’s per-capita income, openness to trade and FDI does not have a statistically significant effect. On the other hand, both per-capita income and FDI have non-linear effects on product sophistication.",Trade sophistication in developing countries: Does export destination matter?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893818301455,January–February 2019,2019,Research Article,341.0

In this article we suggest reassessing foundation payout minimums. To examine the impact of payout rates on grantmaking foundations lifespan and performance under “new normal” economics, we simulate multiple foundations lifecycles using ==== in diverse capital market conditions, with varied investment and payout strategies.====We find that while under past market regime perpetuity seems to be a given, under more probable future scenarios, foundations might face increasingly early mortality and endowment depletion, limiting their potential impact. Furthermore, lower payout rates allow for higher lifetime grantmaking, higher mean annual grantmaking, and lower giving volatility. Accordingly, we suggest a tiered ====, in line with foundations’ missions and proper financial planning.","Foundations have been supporting social causes for hundreds of years, and have become an important factor in public policy making and human service funding and development in developed nations since the beginning of the 20th century. Public debates over their conduct in the US during those years resulted in the Tax Reform Act of 1969, which set a 6% minimum payout, later lowered in 1981 to 5%. In recent decades, there has been a substantial increase in the influence and salience of foundations as well as in the accumulation of wealth in philanthropic endowments and foundations. Foundations have been spreading in Europe and in other areas of the world due to processes of privatization, inter-generational wealth transfer, and shrinking public social expenditures (Barbetta, Colombo, & Turati, 2015). This has rekindled various debates on their functioning and regulation, including their spending rate but also their lifespan, mission related investments and more. Recent trends, and especially the dramatic impact of the 2008 economic crisis on foundations around the world (Dietz, McKeever, Steele, & Steuerle, 2015; Foley, 2016, Havens and Schervish, 2013), along with changing perceptions of foundation management, such as strategic philanthropy (Frumkin, 2006) and time-limited foundations (Ostrower, 2011), require a renewed discussion of foundation practices and policies. In fact, philanthropic foundations operate in a new era when institutional norms are changing, and the financial environment in which they operate has become turbulent and precarious. And yet, underlying the discussion and research on philanthropic foundations to date, there has been an implicit assumption that ‘what has been will always be.’ Accordingly, financial research on foundations mostly relies on historical data. Renowned economist El-Erian (2010) warns against this assumption, and argues that we have entered “a new normal” where the global economic landscape has dramatically changed, and interest rates and investment returns that we saw before the global crisis are converging to lower long-term averages. This notion is supported also by others, such as Summers, 2013, Summers, 2014, who predicts long term stagnation and turbulence in financial markets. The new context, then, requires research under different assumptions and using different methods. When past performance becomes irrelevant, research using analytical tools, such as Monte Carlo simulations, that examine varying market conditions, are more appropriate (Cooley, Hubbard & Walz, 2003; Pfau & Kitces, 2014). Therefore, in this work we study Monte Carlo simulations of payouts for foundations with differing missions, using a range of asset portfolio allocations, under diverse market conditions. The findings of the simulations shed a new light on the payout debate and carry important implications for foundation policies and regulations, as well as for foundation management.",Reconsidering the philanthropic foundation minimum payout policy under a “new normal”,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893818301467,March–April 2019,2019,Research Article,342.0

To carry out our analysis, we exploit an original survey conducted in 2011 on roughly 1500 investors based in Vietnam. We show that some characteristics of the investor firm, including size, productivity, experience and autonomy in decision-making, affect the capacity of linkages to create a larger network of local suppliers. In addition, we show that it is the provision of a good investment climate, and more importantly of key business support services, that mainly influences the capacity of investors to trigger knowledge and other key resources’ transfer to their local suppliers.","In both developing and transition economies Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) are a major source of development finance. Arguably, FDI can be growth enhancing through their direct effect on the amount of domestic investment and can also be potentially positive for local firms through indirect effects and knowledge transfer (Alguacil, Cuadros, & Orts, 2011). However, a large literature has emphasized how FDI do not end up automatically into positive spillovers, but this rather depends on their quality and motivations as well as on other mediating factors such as the type of policy put in place by the government and the incentives to establish mutual cooperation between foreign and local firms (Adams, 2009, Farole and Winkler, 2014).====The literature on FDI has so far mainly found ambiguous results with respect to horizontal spillovers (see Irsova and Havranek, 2013, for a review), while, more often, positive effects are found for vertical spillovers through backward and forward linkages established between MNEs and local firms. Due to these potential benefits, the issues related to linkages have been scrutinized thoroughly by most recent research (see, for instance, Giroud and Scott-Kennel, 2009; Giroud, Jindra, & Marek, 2012; Newman, Rand, Talbot, & Tarp, 2015). Yet, a drawback of research on this topic is that it often analyses only the final outcome generated on local firms; only a few works, instead, focus on which factors may favour or discourage the establishment of the linkages. This research question is particularly relevant to address, especially from a policy point of view, since it is crucial to identify the right type of policies supporting those linkages that can be more conducive to higher amount of knowledge transferred from foreign to local firms.====Still, the studies carried out so far share two main limitations. The first is that through the measure generally adopted, i.e. the share of local supply on total, they provide only an incomplete information on the size of linkages, not accounting, for instance, for the size of the network of domestic suppliers created by foreign firms. Rather, focusing on the number of relations established by foreign affiliates and local firms, as we do to measure the size of linkages in this paper, may help to better identifying which foreign firms generate the higher local spillover potential (Blalock and Gertler, 2008). Although this may seem only a methodological issue, it can be an important piece of information to guide policy, i.e. in view of understanding which kind of firm characteristics should be prioritized by a pro-FDI policy.====A second empirical and theoretical limitation of the previous studies is that in the existing literature the mere existence of a linkage and its level is considered itself a way to generate spillovers. However, not all linkages have the same spillover potential and, as a consequence, the ability to foster positive effects for the host country. The spillover potential of a linkage depends on the direct and intentional transfer of resources from the investing firm (Giroud and Scott-Kennel, 2009), which can be in turn correlated to some characteristics of the firm (e.g. the stock of knowledge; motivations, etc) and of the host country (Farole and Winkler, 2014). Knowing this becomes crucial because it helps to understand which policy instrument to implement – for instance by understanding whether it is better to work on the empowerment of institutional context to favor FDI and/or on the improvement of the absorptive capacities of the local firms. So far, only a few studies have closely looked at the content of linkages (Giroud et al., 2012, Jordaan, 2011; Jindra, Giroud, & Scott-Kennel, 2011; Perri, Andersson, Nell, & Santangelo, 2013) without considering the institutional environment and the provision of business support services as potential factors shaping the decision of foreign firms to create linkages and to provide support to their local suppliers.====In light of the above discussion, our study can be considered as a way to provide guidelines for policy makers on FDI policies that need to be implemented to enhance their effectiveness for sustained growth. We do so by looking at the factors affecting the establishment of backward linkages, their key features once established and the role of institutions in favouring knowledge transfer between foreign and local firms. To carry out our empirical analysis, we exploit an original survey conducted in 2011 on roughly 1500 investors based in Vietnam. The survey provides an ideal setting for our work, considering that it has been designed specifically to understand the pattern of local integration of investors through backward and forward linkages with local firms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using the survey and the first analysing the determinants of linkages in Vietnam, a country that since mid 80’s (with the Doi Moi reforms) has started to implement pro-market reforms and become highly open to FDI. Through this empirical study on the Vietnamese case, we contribute to the existing literature in different ways.====Our first contribution is that of providing a more complete picture of the characteristics of backward linkages. To do this, we closely follow the framework developed by Giroud and Scott-Kennel (2009), arguing that it is necessary to disentangle the “quantity”, i.e. the extent of linkages, and the “quality” of linkages, i.e. the intentional transfer of resources to local suppliers. This framework has been adopted by Giroud et al.’s (2012) analysis on the determinants of the quantity and quality of linkages in Eastern European countries. Differently from their study, however, we consider an alternative measure for the quantity of linkages, i.e. the one considering the number of domestic suppliers. While this measure has rarely been considered in the literature (an exception is the paper by Chen, Chen, & Ku, 2004), on the ground of some work exploring the supply chain effect of FDI (e.g. Blalock and Gertler, 2008, Lin and Saggi, 2007), we claim that the process of creating more linkages, that is a larger size of the network of supplier, is not necessarily driven by the same firm- and host country- characteristics as the traditional value based measures of linkages. Furthermore, we also adopt a more comprehensive definition of the quality of linkages than the one adopted by Giroud et al. (2012), which covers the technological dimension only. Exploiting a specific question of the survey, we are able to include other dimensions of foreign support to domestic firms such as, for example, the degree of training offered, the upgrade of the quality of product and the collaboration in design. In this way we provide a complete description of the content of linkage. Consequently, we can offer policy makers specific guidelines to understand which kind of support can result more effective for local suppliers.====Secondly, we pay specific attention to one policy instrument which is functional to attract quality FDI with high spillover potential, i.e. the presence of a good investment climate and the provision of different types of business support services. In the specific case of Vietnam, Athukorala and Tien (2012) have provided descriptive evidence that a good investment climate can be a suitable attractor for FDI, but no analyses have been conducted to see whether a good investment climate can be conducive to the establishment of linkages. While there is already a large literature linking the overall business environment to investors’ performance (see Xu, 2010, for a review, and Alguacil et al., 2011, for macro-economic evidence on developing countries) as well as studies about the effects of good institutions on FDI attraction (e.g. Globerman and Shapiro, 2003; Bénassy-Quéré, Coupet, & Mayer, 2007; Lee, Alba, & Park, 2018) in our paper we move somewhat further by investigating also which kind of specialized business-services can improve the size and the content of the linkages established.====The remaining of the paper is structured as follows.

The results show that government health expenditure has a positive effect on under-five and infant mortality. However, the results show GDP per capita, health aid, hiv prevalence and immunization have significant negative effects on under-five and infant mortality. The results clearly suggest that health care expenditures have not been translated to improvement in under-five mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The results possibly reflect the high level of ==== and fungibility of public health expenditure in sub-Saharan Africa countries.","In spite of the remarkable improvements in the health conditions and status worldwide, sub-Saharan African countries still suffer from some of the worse health problems. For example, sub-Saharan Africa had an under-five mortality of 165 deaths per 1000 live births and infant mortality of 97 deaths per 1000 live births during the period 2000–2008 (United Nations, 2010). Attempts at improving the health conditions and status in the sub region has led to modest increases in public health expenditure. However, the major concern is the extent to which public health expenditure has impacted public health outcomes in particular under-five and infant mortality in the sub-region. In the developed and other industrialized economies, several studies have provided empirical evidence on the relationship between public health expenditure and health outcomes. In general, no consensus has emerged on the effect of public health spending on health outcomes. While some studies found that public health expenditure has significant impact on health outcomes, some reported that expenditure on public health does not have an impact on health outcomes.====In sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies on the relationship between government health expenditure and under-five as well as infant mortality rates are just evolving==== There is the need for more empirical studies on the effect of health expenditure on child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa countries. This is particularly important considering the high level of under-five and infant mortality rates in the sub region. This explains the rationale for our work.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section presents the literature review. The third section provides the specification of the model. The fourth section reports the empirical findings of the study.

The awareness of the deep impact of housing busts, especially after the global financial crisis (GFC), led macroprudential policymakers to take preemptive actions to mitigate the occurrence of busts and to build banking system and private sector resilience. Borrower-based measures, such as limits to loan-to-value (LTV), debt-service-to-income (DSTI) and loan-to-income (LTI) ratios on residential lending have been applied in several countries (Lim, Columba, Costa, Kongsamut, & Otani, 2011), including in Europe (ESRB, 2017). In the majority of the cases, these policy measures are permanent, only in a few cases are temporary (e.g. New Zealand). Given the increased used of macroprudential measures, the study of their real effects and understanding of how these may hinge on the implementation design are crucial issues for policymakers.====Building on the work of Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and Iacoviello (2005), a recent stream of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models with collateral constraints and mortgage lending highlight the role of countercyclical LTV ratios to counteract financial imbalances related to credit and developments in the real estate sector. In this strand of the literature, the LTV ratio is a policy variable that follows a rule that feedbacks countercyclically on financial and macroeconomic variables, in the spirit of a Taylor rule. Policies based on countercyclical LTV ratios are shown to be beneficial in stabilizing the economy and in increasing welfare (see Quint & Rabanal, 2014, Rubio & Carrasco-Gallego, 2016 and Brzoza-Brzezina, Kolasa, & Makarskin, 2015, for euro area applications).====The literature addressing the effects for the business and financial cycles of permanent tightenings of LTV ratios is scarcer. Lambertini, Mendicino, and Punzi (2013) find that, in a closed economy DSGE model with news-driven cycles, the countercyclical use of a LTV ratio responding to credit is welfare-improving compared to a constant LTV limit. Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) show that leaning-against-the-wind monetary policies have larger benefits in terms of macroeconomic volatility in an economy with higher LTV ratio but do not model macroprudential policy. None of these papers look at the type of policy measures we analyse in our paper.====Directly related to our work is Robinson and Yao (2016) who focus on the implications of temporary and permanent LTV ratio policies in an estimated closed economy DSGE model for the US with collateral constraints based on housing, heterogeneous households and long-term debt. They find that a permanent reduction of the LTV ratio reduces the depth of recessions and extends expansions, with more visible results for the financial cycles than for the real cycles. Unlike this paper, we work with an euro area open economy model and we focus on the adjustment to permanent and transitory changes of the LTV limit. Our paper contributes to the literature by focusing on crucial policy questions: (i) we assess the macroeconomic impact of permanent and temporary changes in the LTV ratio in a small economy within a monetary union based on a fully structural model that allows us to illustrate the transmission mechanisms; and (ii) we consider the impact of different policy designs, namely in terms of the speed of implementation. Even though LTV limits have often been implemented as part of a pack of measures (such as in the recent case of Portugal), we focus on the analysis of stand-alone LTV measures and not of combined measures.====Our main findings are as follows. A permanent reduction of the LTV limit of impatient households in a small euro area economy leads to: (i) a long-run decline in bank lending to the private sector; (ii) a relatively small long-run contractionary macroeconomic impact; and (iii) a tightening of borrowing and economic activity in the short run which is less pronounced if the authorities phase-in the tightening of the LTV ratio. If the reduction in LTV ratios is observed across the euro area the long-run macroeconomic impact in each of the regions is larger but in the short run the recessionary impact is mitigated by the monetary policy response.====These findings are relevant to guide policy. A permanent tightening of the LTV ratio leads to a long-run decline in bank lending to the private sector and this can be achieved more or less rapidly, depending on the design of policy implementation. A quicker implementation comes at the cost of a stronger contraction of lending and economic activity in the short to medium run which may have important implications for the successful implementation of the policy measure. Our results lend support to the often announced objective for a gradual implementation, i.e. preventing unintended lending contraction at the time of implementation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We adopt a continuous treatment approach to quantify how households’ labor supply responds to transfer size. We find a shift from paid labor to own farm labor and find that the transfer size is well within a level that would have ==== effects on time spent on own farm activities. The switch from paid to own farm labor occurs at lower levels of transfers for labor-constrained households, and at higher levels for non-labor constrained households.","Despite Zambia’s strong economic recovery and robust growth over the past decade impacts on poverty rates have been limited. In response to this, Zambia has followed other countries in Africa in launching unconditional cash transfer (CT) programs as part of social protection systems, with the aim of reducing poverty and hunger. Although poverty alleviation is the main goal, these programs may also have significant impacts on rural livelihoods by inducing investments in productive activities and increased production. The literature on CTs has focused mainly on the evaluation of their primary intended outcomes, such as consumption, food security, education and poverty, and less on second-order effects on income generating activities that might be triggered by the injection of liquidity in the household’s economy (Rawlings and Rubio, 2003). Since most effects in productive activities pass through labor decisions, in this paper we focus on how the amount of the transfers affects adults’ labor supply and work incentives of recipient households.====Supporters of CTs see the transfers as a tool to give those at the very bottom of the income ladder a leg up. On the downside, there is increasing concern among policy-makers of the possible incidence of CT on work incentives. In fact, critics of these programs argue that handouts may stifle economic activity and create disincentives to work and a culture of dependency. Recent studies focusing on labor outcomes of CTs in sub-Saharan Africa do not show consistent evidence in this regard. In their analysis of Kenya’s CT-OVC, Asfaw, Davis, Dewbre, Handa, and Winters (2014) did not find significant impacts on labor reallocation overall, even though some heterogeneous impacts by age and gender were observed. Gilligan, Hoddinot, and Taffesse (2009) show no disincentive effects on labor supply looking at Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), while Ardington, Case, and Hosegood (2009) find positive impacts on adult labor supply for South African Old Age Pension.====In Latin America, conditional CTs do not appear to have much impact on work incentives and adult labor supply. Studies from Brazil (Foguel and Barrios Paes de, 2010, Ribas and Veras Soares, 2011), PROGRESA in Mexico (Skoufias and Di Maro, 2008) and Honduras (Alzúa, Cruces, & Ripani, 2013), using a variety of approaches, did not find a significant impact on participation in adult wage employment. Some evidence shows, however, that CCTs may modestly reduce the time spent working, for males in Nicaragua and females in Brazil, as well as substitution between wage employment and domestic housework in Brazil.====Economic theory suggests several ways of how unconditional CTs might affect adult labor supply in recipient households. CTs constitute an increase in non-labor income which causes a loosening of the household budget constraint making work less attractive relative to leisure. However, in the presence binding credit and liquidity constraints selling their own labor might be the only viable strategy for adult household members to obtain some liquidity and meet their consumption or investment needs (Rose, 2001). This can lead to distortions in livelihood strategies as when households are forced to sell more labor off-farm than would be optimal. In this respect, unconditional CTs can provide a secure source of liquidity that may help rural households overcome credit market failures and consequently allow them to work more on their own farms thus affecting off-farm and on-farm labor allocative efficiency. The interplay of these channels makes it an empirical question whether, and to what extent, a given amount of CT affects the labor supply and work incentives of recipient households.====In this paper we are interested in the impacts of transfer size on labor supply. This is obtained by comparing the average labor supply of those exposed to a given level of treatment with the average outcome of the controls. This question is relevant from both a policy perspective and an empirical point of view. On the one hand, governments are interested in knowing not only whether providing cash to poor vulnerable households create disincentives to work or not, but also whether it exists a threshold level in the size of the transfer below which transfers can contribute to developmental objectives without creating welfare traps and distorting the domestic labor market. Further, governments in many low-income countries are worried about the long-term fiscal sustainability that is implied when the cash transfer is offered above a certain amount. This concern, however, is not tackled in the paper. On the other hand, by adopting a continuous treatment approach, we are able to identify causal pathways between changes in labor supply and the magnitude of the change in unearned income given by the amount of the received transfer. The main econometric problem is that treatment was not randomized among the different transfer amounts which opens the way to potential endogeneity bias. We adopt two estimation strategies for the continuous treatment effects: the first one is a doubly robust approach that combines OLS regression with inverse probability of treatment reweighting and relies on a selection-on-observables kind of identifying assumption; the second one recognizes that the treatment might be endogenous allowing for selection on unobservables and consists of an instrumental variables approach.====To the best of our knowledge this is the first empirical paper that studies how household labor response changes with the amount of the received cash transfer. This study is the natural continuation of a previous paper from the same authors that focused on the binary treatment effect of the cash transfer program obtained by the comparison of the treated as a whole, regardless of the transfer size, and the controls (Prifti et al., 2017).",How much is too much: Does the size of income support transfers affect labor supply?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893818301285,January–February 2019,2019,Research Article,346.0

Among the possible causes of such uneven evolution, culture is starting to attract the attention of a growing number of scholars. The present paper surveys some of the most important contributions on culture and economics, with a particular focus on the definition and measurement of culture and on the impact of different cultural traits on economic variables. According to this review of the literature, cultures emphasising individual effort while providing equal opportunities for everyone are more likely to encourage sustained economic growth.","What determines the huge differences in economic conditions worldwide? Why don’t poorer countries simply replicate what richer ones are doing? Why do individuals often behave differently from how economic theory predicts? Economic literature has grouped the answers to these questions into three main categories. The first one focuses on the role of institutions (Acemoglu, Johnson, & Robinson, 2001); the second one highlights the importance of psychological factors (Thaler, 1985). The third answer is that culture plays a major role here (Alesina & Giuliano, 2015). As far as differences in economic conditions are concerned, governments do not operate in a cultural vacuum, so policies aimed at fostering economic growth must be tailored to the prevailing culture to be effective (Fukuyama, 1995; Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, & Shleifer, 2004; Greif, 1994; Minkov and Blagoev, 2009, Tabellini, 2010).====Furthermore, not all cultures are equally favourable for economic growth (Barro, 1991). Some tribal societies in Africa consider economy a zero-sum game (the so-called “limited-good syndrome”), in which every private gain is obtained at the expense of collectivity, and determined by luck, fraud or witchcraft (Platteau, 2000). In sub-Saharan Africa individuals find meaning in life through protecting the traditional order, and are thus discouraged from pursuing social and economic success (Schwartz, 2004). In the same way, many Native American cultures discourage individuals from distinguishing themselves and emerging as better than others (Lester, 1997). In such cultural environments, it is almost impossible to start a new entrepreneurial or innovative activity, to accumulate and invest wealth and, thus, to spur economic growth (Mokyr, 2016).====Culture, in particular strong family ties, can also lead family firms not to behave in an optimising way, since that would cause the firm’s objectives to merge with those of the family, and thus not respond to profit-maximising conditions hypothesised by theoretical models (Bertrand & Schoar, 2006).====Until recently, economists disregarded culture in their analyses of economic phenomena, leaving the field to sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists and organisational scholars (Maridal, 2013, Minkov and Blagoev, 2009). This has not always been the case: classical economists were well aware of the important role played by culture in shaping both society and the economy. Back in the eighteenth century, Adam Smith pointed out the pivotal role played by trust in essentially every market transaction. Then, in the nineteenth century, John Stuart Mill recognised that, under certain conditions, there is a primacy of cultural constraints over the pursuit of personal interest (Mill, 1843). In his oft-cited book, ====, Weber (1905) states that, by encouraging individuals to pursue their own wealth, the Protestant Reformation was one of the main forces behind the development of capitalism. On the other hand, Marx (1859) was convinced that it is the economic structure with its underlying technology that determines the prevailing culture. Marx’ and Weber’s contrasting views suggest that an important issue in the field of culture and economics deals with the direction of causality: is it culture that affects the economic conditions of countries or vice versa?====The contribution of these early proponents, however, fell on deaf ears for many years, since economists felt no need to introduce new and fuzzy variables, such as cultural ones, to their models. This lack of interest was mainly due to the absence of a clear definition of culture (Guiso, Sapienza, & Zingales, 2006; Roland, 2015). Furthermore, cultural explanations were at great risk of been interpreted as products of intellectual laziness, considering all the factors that traditional models were unable to capture (Fukuyama, 2001, Roland, 2015). Culture was, at best, considered a selection mechanism between different equilibria (Greif, 1994).====The way in which culture finally managed to enter economic discourse was through the work and ideas of non-economists. The most important contributions are those by Banfield (1958) and Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti (1994). In ====, Banfield reports that in Montegranaro, a small city in the South of Italy, individuals act to maximize the short-run material advantage of their nuclear family, and assume that all others will do the same. This selfish behaviour, labelled “amoral familism”, can explain the development gap between Northern and Southern Italy. Putnam et al. (1994) investigate how localised social capital affects the performance of institutions in Italy and conclude that more altruistic societies tend to have better institutions. Between the end of the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first century, the idea that including culture could enrich the understanding of economic phenomena began to attract a growing number of scholars. Of course, the availability of larger data sets measuring cultural values, and the improvement of statistical tools, both played a major role in this shift of attention towards culture.====It is worth noting that more business-oriented scholars recognised the importance of cultural factors well before other economists. In the late twentieth century, cultural explanations were already commonly accepted in subfields like strategy, management and organisation theory (Papamarcos & Watson, 2006). The oft-cited example of the importance of cultural factors in management is the one about Toyota and the impracticability to simply blindly copy its organisation in the Western world, because of the impossibility of replicating the cultural setting that sustains the so-called “just-in-time” production technique (Liker, 2004).====However, in a certain sense, economists have always built their theories by relying on cultural norms. In the typical market transaction, there is an implicit assumption that individuals will behave correctly and not rob or murder one another, because cultural norms require it (Fukuyama, 2001). Individuals can ignore formal rules, unless strongly motivated to follow them. Culture can provide individuals with such motivation (Greif, 2006). Thus, the literature on culture and economics is just an attempt to explicitly assert what has already been implicitly stated in classical economic literature.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the reader with some definitions of culture. Section 3 deals with measurement issues, presenting four approaches to data collection: surveys (Section 3.1), epidemiological studies (Section 3.2), experiments (Section 3.3) and big data (Section 3.4). Section 4 lists the most studied cultural traits: trust (Section 4.1), individualism (Section 4.2), importance of family ties and generalised morality (Section 4.3), attitudes toward work and the perception of poverty (Section 4.4). Section 5 focuses on the most common issues cultural economics is dealing with: causality (Section 5.1), persistence (Section 5.2) and economic outcomes (Section 5.3). Cultural impacts on countries' institutions (Section 5.3.1), economic performances (Section 5.3.2), financial (Section 5.3.3) and labour markets (Section 5.3.4), as well as innovation (Section 5.3.5), represent the core of this paper. Section 6 summarises the main findings. Section 7 concludes.",Does culture matter for the economic performance of countries?

Secondary school dropout, indeed, hinders the accumulation of adequate levels of human capital and anticipates entry into the unskilled labor market.====Thus, policy-makers should aim at the extension and efficacy of compulsory education to the secondary level to avoid future under-education problems to promote a skilled workforce and encourage economic development and growth in the long run.","A large and varied body of literature has identified investment in human capital as a key factor in favoring economic growth for developing countries (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 2003, Hanushek and Kimko, 2000, Hanushek, 2013). Formal schooling is one of several important contributors to the skills of an individual and human capital. It is especially through formal schooling that individuals can accumulate adequate levels of human capital to access the skilled labor market. The availability of a skilled workforce is a key element to ensure economic development and growth in the long run (Boccanfuso, Larouche, & Trandafir, 2015; Jung & Thorbecke, 2003).====Education is also a top priority for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO is entrusted to lead and coordinate the Education 2030 Agenda, which is part of a global movement to eradicate poverty through 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Education, essential to achieving all of these goals, is encapsulated in Goal 4, which aims to ‘ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all’ (UNESCO, 2017).====In recent decades, theoretical and empirical studies have analyzed the relationship between labor force education quality and quantity and economic growth in some developing countries. Boccanfuso et al. (2015), focusing on Senegal, analyzed the relationship between the quality of education and the labor market, while the survey by Leuven and Oosterbeek (2011) investigated the importance of the mismatch between the professional contents of post-primary formal education and the skills required by the productive system. This issue can be sorted by in terms of education quantity increases that range from the increase in years of schooling to the increase in the number of schools and infrastructures (Richardson, 2011).====The relevance of investment in human capital in developing countries is confirmed by the adoption of specific policies aimed at increasing the number of years of compulsory education as well as the introduction of free primary education in many countries (Murmane & Ganimian, 2016). As a result, since the beginning of the 2000s, the primary school completion rate has significantly increased in many developing countries (World Bank, 2016), possibly suggesting the efficacy of governments setting minimum requirements (years) of compulsory education to increase the completion rates.====The international policy focus is on primary education, and secondary education is only recently being considered (SDG). As a result, the enrollment rate is poor at the secondary level, possibly because the role of government in secondary education is not as clear as for primary education. Investment in secondary education is necessary and urgent for economic growth of developing countries (World Bank, 2017). This is confirmed by the literature, which suggests that secondary education is necessary for economic growth because primary education is not sufficient to provide adequate skills to workers (see, for instance, Barro and Lee, 2010, Evoh, 2007; Sochirca, Afonso, Tavares Silva, & Neves, 2016; Weale, 2003). Research needs to inform policy makers on policy reforms, program design and investment to increase and improve secondary education as a necessary condition for labor force development and economic growth.====We aim to fill this gap by investigating the impact of specific government policies extending compulsory education to secondary school attainment level on labor market opportunities of young people in developing countries. For this purpose, we analyze the impact of dropout from secondary school on the work prospects of young individuals in some developing countries.====The analyses may offer important policy implications and suggestions. On the one hand, finding a negative impact of secondary school dropout on the work prospects of youth policy initiatives increasing the school leaving age and assistance by extending government-mandated compulsory levels of schooling would be effective for improving the labor market opportunities of youth and the economic growth of developing countries. On the other hand, if the impact of secondary school dropout on labor market opportunities for youth is found to be positive (or null), this would suggest the lack of efficacy of policies increasing compulsory education level and, more specifically, the lack of a need for such government intervention.====The impact of such policies on the labor markets of developing countries is also related to the level of skill required by the labor demand. Evidence from developing countries has revealed that employers expect future demand for workers to be strongest for skilled production posts or non-elementary occupations — for instance, in the manufacturing sector, such as plant and machine operators or assemblers and craft and related trade workers (see, for example, Elder, 2014; Manacorda, Rosati, Ranzani, & Dachille, 2017). A skilled workforce goes hand in hand with economic growth. Skills development needs to be part of a comprehensive, integrated strategy for growth that improves the lives of all. Core work skills help individuals to understand the labor market and make more informed choices about their options in education, training, wage employment, and self-employment. Generally, education improves a young person’s chances of securing a better job and increases his/her productivity and income and society as a whole (Annabi, 2017, Brewer, 2013, Hanushek and Woessman, 2012).====These decent jobs require a minimum of post-secondary education that, at the moment, only a small share of the youth population has acquired. Among others, this may be seen as a consequence of school dropout (Pieters, 2013). School dropout represents, as a whole, a key issue when investigating the accumulation of human capital, especially in developing countries, where school dropout is a persistent and widespread phenomenon, particularly at the secondary school level (see, for example, Krishnaratne, White, & Carpenter, 2013; UNESCO, 2012). The decision to leave the educational system early may be crucial in shaping later life experience, including work outcomes, especially for poorer women (Krogh, Hansen, Wendt, & Elkjaer, 2009).====Participation, especially completion of formal education is considered the most important component of investment in human capital (World Economic Forum, 2015).====Based on these considerations, we decided to focus our analyses of the effect of dropout on the working outcomes of the sample of youth that completed primary education and were able to start secondary education. We, therefore, include youth that completed secondary school and youth that leave the secondary cycle before completion. In this sample, we estimate the effect of secondary school dropout on work prospects.====We analyze ten developing countries into three world macroregions: (i) ‘Sub-Saharan Africa’, (ii) ‘South-East and Central Asia’, and (iii) ‘Latin America and the Caribbean’. We investigate five work outcomes: (i) nonworking, (ii) unpaid work, and (iii) self-employment, as well as employment in (iv) non-elementary and (v) elementary occupations.==== Disentangling non-elementary and elementary occupations is particularly important for highlighting differences, as explained above, between the skilled and unskilled workforce and labor markets. We use the International Labor Organization School-to-Work Transition Survey (ILO SWTS), which provides internationally comparable data. Moreover, we add a gender-specific analysis with the aim of highlighting the disadvantaged positions and specific behaviors of females in the labor markets of developing countries (Rendall, 2013).====At the empirical level, a crucial issue is whether common unobserved factors (for example, motivations, preferences, economic shocks) guide both secondary school dropout and work outcomes. Accounting for the resulting endogeneity is therefore essential to avoid biased estimations (see Campolieti, Fang, & Gunderson, 2010). With this in mind, our empirical strategy consists of estimating a two-equation system model (e.g., Altonji, Elder, & Taber, 2005) where both the (multinomial) work equation and the (binary) secondary school dropout equation are modeled and correlations between the equations’ residuals are allowed to account for endogeneity.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the econometric methodology used to estimate the impact of secondary school dropout on work prospects. Section 3 describes the data and defines the indicators. Section 4 sets out the estimation results for both the work and secondary school dropout equations. Section 5 discusses the findings as a policy guide.

It also features a temporal dimension related to the inappropriate responses of financial market participants to changes in risk over time. This paper proposes a method to simultaneously address the cross-sectional and the time dimension in which systemic risk materializes. The method is based on the TOPHITS algorithm. It provides three scores, namely borrowing, lending and time scores: the first two represent the systemic importance of the borrowing and the lending activity associated with each ====,while the third represents an empirical Early Warning Signal of the financial crisis. Our findings reveal that the identification of the time score as an indicator for an incoming market distress could be relevant to design macro prudential policies.","Since the beginning of the financial crisis erupted in 2007 it has become clear that banking regulation was deficient. The events proved that financial regulation did not live up to its expectations (see Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Smaga, & Witkowski, 2016). Indeed, a strong emphasis has been put on macroprudential regulation.====One of the most important distinguishing characteristics of banks, compared to other financial intermediaries, is the mismatch of maturities between their assets and liabilities. Because banks’ liabilities (mainly deposits) are callable on sight while their assets (mainly credit) are due at much longer term, banks are, by construction, intrinsically illiquid. In “normal” times, the interbank market serves as an efficient mechanism to channel funds from banks that have a surplus of liquidity toward banks that have a deficit of it. In times of financial distress, the intrinsic illiquidity of banks at the individual level translates, at the macro level, into an intrinsic fragility of the banking system. A shock affecting a single bank gets immediately transmitted to other institutions through the risk posed by balance sheet relationships and interdependencies among players (see Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, & Tahbaz-Salehi, 2015; Allen, Babus, & Carletti, 2012; Battiston, Gatti, Gallegati, Greenwald, & Stiglitz, 2012; Castiglionesi & Navarro, 2007; Igan, Kabundi, De Simone, & Tamirisa, 2017; Krause and Giansante, 2012, Wagner, 2010, Zawadowski, 2013).====When mentioning ==== risk we refer to the risk of collapse of an entire financial market rather than to the risk associated with an individual entity of the system. In the notes on macroprudential policy framework, three of the main supervisory authorities, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), pointed out that systemic risk regards two related dimensions: the cross-sectional and the temporal dimension. The cross-sectional dimension concerns balance sheet linkages across institutions in a financial system. In this respect, systemic risk arises because the distress of an institution can affect other parts of the system via domino and cascade effects. But this is not the end of the story. Systemic risk materializes also in the temporal dimension. Such dimension of systemic risk stems from the existence of information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders and is related to the financial accelerator narrative and to the inappropriate responses of financial market participants to changes in risk over time (see Borio, Furfine, & Lowe, 2001). Moreover, the two dimensions of systemic risk are also closely intertwined and reinforce each other. An increase in the number and/or in the size of transactions among players, feeds the increasing trend of the financial cycle. On the other hand, strong asset growth and credit expansion bring more connections into the system, as financial institutions increase leverage and non-core funding exposures with other agents (see Borio et al., 2001).====The scope of this work is to render the view expressed by the FSB, the IMF and the BIS operational, by translating the observations underlined by these organizations into a practical tool.====Given the systemic nature of the financial crisis and the recognition that interconnectedness among financial intermediaries have played a crucial role in spreading the crisis (see Arnold, 2012), this article proposes a new network-based measure able to address systemic risk in a unified framework, in which both the time and the cross-sectional dimension, together with their feedback mechanisms, are considered simultaneously. On one hand, addressing systemic risk in the cross-sectional dimension requires the measurement of the interconnections among institutions to evaluate the impact of their bilateral exposures on other participants within the system. On the other hand, to address systemic risk in the time dimension it is necessary to forecast the turning point of the financial cycle via Early Warning Signals (EWSs) capable of indicating in advance the end of a period of excessive credit growth, in the run-up to a financial crisis.====Identifying Systemically Important Banks, as the most “central” nodes in a network, is an intrinsically complex task. Not surprisingly researchers in network theory have produced a vast amount of centrality measures that allow ranking nodes in a network according to their systemic importance.====Even though Basel III explicitly considers the interconnectedness between banks, the measure proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) seems inappropriate for at least two reasons. First, this measure of systemic importance embeds no information regarding higher order exposures, i.e. the measure is fully determined by the exposures of a bank vis-a-vis its direct peers, but completely neglects the exposures of the peers themselves, as well as the exposures of the peers of its peers, etc. Second, the interbank market is highly dynamic. Existing financial connections might dissolve and new ones emerge continuously. Therefore, when identifying Systemically Important Banks, it seems pertinent to consider the evolution over time of the linkages between institutions and not only the network features at one point in time.====Dynamic networks can be naturally represented as a time-ordered sequence of adjacency matrices, each one describing the state of the network at a given point in time. Such representation forms a multidimensional object called ====. To identify Systemically Important Banks, we modify the ==== (TOPHITS) algorithm developed by Kolda and Bader (2009) to consider the weighted and integrated nature of financial networks (see Arribas, Pérez, & Tortosa-Ausina, 2011, on banking integration indicators) and we apply it in the context of the interbank market.==== Indeed, as shown by Deguchi, Takahashi, Takayasu, and Takayasu (2014), for economic networks that are intrinsically weighed, algorithms that explicitly consider the weights are more appropriate to describe their features with respect to methods based on their binary representation. In a nutshell, the algorithm consists in decomposing the original tensor into three score vectors such that their outer product provides an approximation of the original tensor. The three scores produced by the algorithm correspond the systemic importance of banks along the three dimensions of the tensor: ====, ==== and ====.====Our method is consistent with the Basel III method, as it simultaneously identifies Systemically Important Borrowers (SIBs) and Systemically Important Lenders (SILs). However, our methodology is superior to the Basel III method in at least two ways. First, SIBs and SILs are identified using information about higher order exposures, as opposed to Basel III that regards first order exposures solely. Moreover, our method produces only one borrowing and one lending score value for each financial institution using the information embedded in all the temporal observations. Second, the algorithm simultaneously produces a third score, the time score, that provides information about the distribution of the traded volume over time, among players with different systemic importance. The time score can be employed as an Early Warning Signal, starting to fall before the financial crisis unfolds. In fact, in the pre-crisis phase, the transaction volume between institutions holding a high borrowing/lending score shrinks and becomes smaller than the ones of less important institutions, which, in turn, increase their systemic importance.====Like the Basel III method, the TOPHITS algorithm will tend to label as important borrower (lender) those banks with many incoming (outgoing) links as well as those banks that borrow (lend) large amounts. Because the algorithm considers the entire network structure though (by regarding higher order exposures), the algorithm will further assign the adjective “systemically” when the following tautological statements are true: SIBs are pointed to by many SILs and SILs point to many SIBs. Indeed, a bank that does not honor its obligations, forces its lender to write down the lent amount from its assets.==== As a result, the lender might reduce – or, at the extreme, stop all together – its supply of funds to the market, which amplifies a shock that originated at a single borrower. Obviously, the more systemically important the lender is, the larger the potential impact of such a write-down on the entire market will be. Therefore, a bank that borrows from a SIL is likely to be systemically important too. By analogy, SILs will be banks that provide liquidity to SIBs. If a bank stops lending to a certain bank, the borrowing bank might not be able to roll-over its interbank obligations. Whenever the borrower is not able to replace the lender by another one, it means that it might not be able to honor its obligations with a potentially large number of lenders. Clearly, the more systemically important the borrower is, the larger will be the amplification effect of the shock that originated at a single lending institution. Therefore, as in the previous case, banks that lend to SIBs probably deserve to be labeled as systemically important too, for they have a significant potential to destabilize the entire market too.====As in Acemoglu et al. (2015), but in a slightly different context, we conclude that higher order exposures are key to determine the systemic importance of individual institutions.====The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 exposes the TOPHITS algorithm employed for the empirical analysis; Section 3 presents the e-MID interbank market dataset with some descriptive statistics and the dynamics of transactions; Section 4 deals with the empirical analysis, showing the emergence of SIFIs and identifying Early Warning Signal; Section 5 strengthens the policy aspects derived from the empirical analysis; Section 6 outlines some conclusions.",Identifying Systemically Important Banks: A temporal approach for macroprudential policies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893818301066,January–February 2019,2019,Research Article,349.0

This increase in debt resulted in a decrease in the fiscal space available to governments at a time when it was most needed. The literature has so far focused its efforts on the analysis of the effects of regulation in the banking and the financial sectors (Caprio and Honohan, 1999, Lyons, 2009), but the impact of lower levels of overall regulation in the economy and its effects beyond the financial industry have not yet been investigated.====A better understanding of what determines the choice of bailing out a firm, regardless of its sector, and of why governments resort to a certain type of bailout rather than to another, can help policymakers reduce this type of expenditure, and make it more transparent and widely accepted by the citizens. This could ultimately result in both a gain of fiscal space for the government, and an increase in the legitimacy of the decisions to bail out firms.====This paper investigates empirically the relation between product market regulation and the frequency and size of bailouts, distinguishing between types of ad-hoc measures used to rescue firms in turmoil.====Regulation can affect the frequency and size of bailouts through two channels. Traditionally, if a country has a very competitive market, the ability of the government to intervene directly in the economy could be lower than in a highly regulated one. According to this hypothesis, more regulated economies will experience a higher rate of discretionary government intervention, both through direct acquisition and financing of firms, and through a higher level of aid granted by the State, compared to the less regulated and more competitive economies.====On the other hand, a higher level of regulation could shield firms from competition, resulting in a lower need for government intervention. Thanks to the distinction between different types of measures undertaken by governments, this paper introduces and tests a third scenario, where the level of regulation could influence not only the frequency and size of bailouts, but also the instrument chosen by the government to help firms in distress: depending on the level of regulation in the economy, the government will tend to help firms resorting to more transparent instruments at its disposal, the lower the level of regulation in the product market.====In addressing this question I define bailouts as a set of ad-hoc measures taken by governments, aimed at financially helping firms in turmoil. Bailouts are captured though a set of macroeconomic variables, differentiating between the type of bailout, whether it is the direct acquisition of a firm – the most “traditional” definition of bailout – or whether it takes place through the granting of State aid. This extends the classical definition of bailouts to every instrument available to policymakers to respond to extreme events, and it helps linking these responses to the overall policy stance in normal times and the existing policy environment, as described by the overall level of regulation in the economy.====To capture the direct acquisition of a stake in the firm by the government I use the stock-flow adjustment of government debt and its components. Stock-flow adjustments are defined as the difference between the change in the stock of debt in a period and the government deficit for that same time window. Since stock-flow adjustments are not included in the deficit, they have been made the object of several studies on creative accounting and fiscal transparency (von Hagen and Wolff, 2006, Weber, 2012), but their role has not been investigated outside this particular field. To capture the least transparent type of bailouts, I use State aid granted to firms as an exception to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and monitored by the European Commission. State aid includes off-budget measures, as well as foregone revenue, and in-budget expenditure, a different type of government intervention, compared to stock-flow adjustments, not necessarily reflected in government debt statistics. Relying on these aggregates emancipates the analysis of bailouts from anecdotal evidence and offers the advantage of relying on data closely monitored by the European Commission and measured homogeneously across countries. To capture the level of regulation in the economy I use the product market regulation indicators, produced by the OECD.====A higher level of regulation is, in this analysis, associated with the lower likelihood of a bailout and a lower expenditure in bailouts. Countries with a lower level of product market regulation experience higher stock-flow adjustments and a higher level of net acquisition of financial assets. In contrast, the level of State aid granted by countries is higher in more regulated economies. Results are valid for a sub-set of indicators, especially those capturing the overall level of regulation in the country rather than a specific type of procedure.====These findings highlight the importance of regulation and the role of government in the economy in determining the types of measures implemented in times of crisis. In light of this finding it would also be recommended that although State aid and stock-flow adjustments are closely monitored, this monitoring effort should not be carried on separately, and instead the two measures should be assessed together. In a policy perspective, given the role of State aid in bailouts, it might be advisable to put more stress in communicating the overall spending in State aid. State aid and acquisitions are both instruments available to policymakers for the same aim, and such they should be monitored and assessed.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 briefly discusses the literature; data sources are described in Section 3, while the methodology and results are reported in Section 4; Section 5 concludes.",Bailouts: The lesser of two evils?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893818301157,January–February 2019,2019,Research Article,350.0

The results showed that production-research expenditure was the most explicit to reduce the amount of nitrogen fertilizer usage, while breeding-research expenditure was the most explicit in terms of increasing farmers’ economic status from planting rice. Processing expenditure seemed to be the least effective spending among the three types.","The outputs from research expenditure are expected to improve the economic and social conditions, especially in under-developed and developing countries. The major expectation of the research expenditure for the under-developed and the developing countries is to abate the poverty of farmers (Baur et al., 2003, Isvilanonda, 2007). Hossain and Pingali (1998) and Diagne et al. (2013) showed that the outputs from research expenditure can really make a change to the economy and society.====In Thailand, research outputs are claimed to be underutilized (Panich, 2003). The National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), an organization that is substantially responsible for determining research policy, and the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) attempted to construct an impact assessment system to evaluate research outputs conducted in Thailand.====Impact assessment is used to specify or estimate the effects from expenditure in research studies. There are typically two types of studies—economic surplus and econometric analysis. The economic surplus approach is used to measure the net benefit which occurred from a specific, induced research study normally in terms of the net present value (NPV), the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and the internal rate of return (IRR). Evenson (1996) and Setboonsarng (1996) adopted the economic surplus technique to set the priorities of rice research projects.====Econometric analysis, on the other hand, combines statistics and economic and mathematical theories to observe the relationships between research expenditures and their impacts. In the agricultural research sector, this technique has been typically applied to estimate the annual productivity was impacted by various production factors (e.g. capital stock, land used in agriculture, weather conditions and labor) and public agricultural research expenditure (Alston, Norton, & Pardey, 1998).====The total factor productivity (TFP) is one of the most famous indicators that have been commonly used to measure agricultural productivity (Evenson, Pray, & Rosegrant, 1999). In Thailand, Suphannachart and Warr (2012) used TFP measurement in the crop and livestock sectors and explored the factors that affected TFP during 1970–2006. The ordinary least squares (OLS) method was used to explain TFP in this study. China and Indonesia have also used TFP to measure agricultural productivity. For example, Wang, Gao, and Wang (2009) used the OLS method to estimate how production factors affected the TFP in 1978–2004. The OLS in this study was classified into three types—common OLS, dynamic-panel OLS and full-modified OLS. A comparison between the models was also included. In Indonesia, Warr (2012) used the OLS method to estimate how the production factors and public agricultural research expenditure affected the TFP in 1974–2006. This study also considered international expenditure on agricultural research in addition to government expenditure. The factors in this study were similar to those in Suphannachart and Warr (2012).====The impact assessment of research expenditure that considers economic, social and environmental impacts is usually mentioned in the context of sustainability evaluation (Laedre, Haavaldsen, Bohne, Kallaos, & Lohne, 2015). Sustainability evaluation has often included economic, social and environmental aspects as endogenous factors such as farmers’ income, farmers’ debt, gender equity and soil fertility (Parthasarathy, 2012) in addition to TFP.====Since the OLS technique might be too limited to explore the relationships between multiple endogenous and multiple exogenous factors, path analysis (such as structural equation modeling or simultaneous equation modeling) has been gaining popularity with many researchers since 2003 (Evenson, 2003).====Avila, Evenson, De Silva, and Almeida (2003) and McKinsey and Evenson (2003) used structural equation modeling to evaluate the relationships. The model of Avila et al. (2003) studied the impact of crop breeding development factors on various crop production levels in Brazil from 1978 to 1998. The crop production impacts consisted of the crop yield index, varietal turnover (VT) factor and rate of seed utilization. The exogenous variables were described by the Brazilian agricultural research corporation as: farmers’ education opportunity, agricultural service for farmers, the percentage of nitrogen fertilizer, research stock and allocated budget to the state from public sector, utilization of pest control and plant disease resistance of modern variety (MV), the proportion of a state’s cropped area and the percentage of seeds being sold. This study used VT to reflect farmers’ adoption of MV and one of the major findings showed that the VT factor significantly increased crop yield indirectly via the rate of seed utilization.====McKinsey and Evenson (2003) evaluated the impact from crop breeding factors on Indian agriculture during 1965–1994. This study explored the impact on the amount of shared crop areas from both the adoption of MV and the irrigation investments, and also investigated the relationship between the MV adoption and irrigation investments. Moreover, this study investigated the impact on crop yield from the amount of shared crop areas, irrigation investments and the adoption of MV. The endogenous variables used to represent the farmers’ behaviors related to crop production and consisted of: the amount of shared area in the district, new crop cultivar adoption, the ratio of irrigated crop area and crop yield. The exogenous variables were classified into six groups: government policy, price, weather, climate, edaphic and the percentage of new cultivar adoption. Public research expenditure was included in the government policy variable. The results showed that MV adoption did contribute to an increase in Indian agricultural productivity. In addition, the public research system was claimed to have a high impact on the development of MV, especially on rice and wheat.====Shadfar and Malekmohammadi (2013) conducted a study on the development of state intervention policies in the rice production system in the northern region of Iran. The state intervention policies were considered in terms of economic and social themes. A set of primary data was collected from rice farmers in 147 states in 2008. The structural equation modeling method was used to study the relationship between state intervention factors and rice production development. In this study, the selected latent variables were: expenditure in science research and technology, a trade and marketing factor, an infrastructure development factor, farming technology status and a market regulation factor. The results showed that the effectiveness of each individual policy was already saturated for the rice business in Iran.====Yasar, Siwar, and Firdaus (2015) studied the impacts of economic, social, environmental, technological, and institutional aspects on Malaysian rice farming sustainability in 2012. The primary data were obtained from 350 farmer interviews. This study used the structural equation modeling method to analyze the relationships between latent variables. The finding showed that all variables except for the institution aspect had significant impacts on rice farming sustainability.====Jaijit, Paoprasert, and Pichitlamken (in press) used the structural equation modeling to assess economic and social impacts from rice research expenditure of Thailand in 2008–2015. The used data were secondary data obtained from the National Research Management Systems (NRMS) database for research expenditure data and the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) for impact data. Rice crop productivity, farmers’ income and plantation cost were used to assess the economic aspect. The social aspect was indicated by the numbers in farmers’ households. These aspects were considered to receive an effect from rice research expenditure through breeding and processing subsidies. The results indicated the magnitudes of the impact that could be used for research budget allocation in the future.====Since organic rice products have been gaining popularity domestically and internationally in Thailand, there have been many research studies related to organic rice expenditure by the government (Chinvarasopak, 2015; Pornpratansombat, Bauer, & Boland, 2011; Yodkhum, Gheewala, & Sampattagul, 2017). It is interesting to further consider the environmental impact from rice research studies in addition to the economic and social aspects. This current study mainly extended Jaijit et al. (in press) to include the environmental aspect in the list of endogenous factors. In addition, this current study added production research expenditure in the list of exogenous factors, since the three types of rice research expenditure captured more than 80 percent of the total rice research expenditure in Thailand.",The impact of rice research expenditure policy in Thailand,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893818301017,January–February 2019,2019,Research Article,351.0

The paper extends the existing literature by investigating the effects of two implementation issues: level of aggregation of mutual funds (MF); definition of farmers’ contribution (i.e. premium) to MF. We use a simulation approach based on a FADN panel data set of 3421 farms over a period of 7==== ","Farming is a risky business because forces beyond the control of farmers affect their income (Mishra & Sandretto, 2002). More specifically, farmers’ income reveal a high variability due to volatile product prices and in yields, as well as due to the occurrence of catastrophic risks such as natural disasters and animal/plant diseases. The resulting income instability negatively affects farmers’ well-being and their decisions, their ability to expand operations and repay debt and, in turns, this can also have secondary effects on agribusiness firms and creditors (Mishra and El-Osta, 2001, Mishra and Sandretto, 2002; Vrolijk & Poppe, 2008). Thus, farm income and farm income distribution are of high importance for policy makers (e.g. El Benni and Finger, 2013, Liesivaara and Myyrä, 2016a, Liesivaara and Myyrä, 2016b, Severini and Tantari, 2013) Several instruments have been proposed to support farmers in coping with (increasing) income risks (see, e.g. Bielza Diaz-Caneja, Conte, Dittmann, Gallego Pinilla, & Stroblmair, 2008; Meuwissen, Assefa, & Van Asseldonk, 2013; for examples and overviews). Indeed, agricultural policies both in the US and European countries have provided disaster relief by ==== measures to cover (====) catastrophic risks and product price stabilisation policies. In particular, direct support provided by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct payments has been found to stabilise farm income of EU farmers (Severini, Tantari, & Di Tommaso, 2016a, 2016b; Severini, Tantari, & Di Tommaso, 2017).====Recent policy developments have been characterised by a shift away from direct public intervention towards the support of public–private partnerships that help farmers to cope with the risks they face. National governments aim to reduce the provision of ==== measures to cover catastrophic risks because this of the unpredictable nature of the costs of such measures and the growing financial constraints faced in recent years. Recent CAP reforms have reduced the role of price stabilisation measures. Moreover, next CAP reform steps will likely reduce the decoupled support provided by direct payment policies. All these developments are increasing EU farmers’ income risks, which is furthermore expected to be amplified by increasing risk exposure due to climate change (e.g. Reidsma, Ewert, Lansink, & Leemans, 2010). However, the recent reform of the CAP has introduced three different risk management measures that are based on the developments of public–private partnerships within the framework of the EU Rural Development Policy (RDP).==== First, insurance premium subsidies have been introduced (already 2009, e.g. Liesivaara & Myyrä, 2016b). Second, mutual funds are supported (Meuwissen et al., 2013). Third, the so-called Income Stabilisation Tool (IST) has been introduced (see El Benni, Finger, & Meuwissen, 2016, for details).====This latter tool explicitly aims at smoothing the farm income variability between years. Hence, in comparison with yield insurances, it focuses not just on production risk but on the overall farm income offering, at least potentially, large scope for managing income risk.====The IST provides compensation to farmers who experience a severe income drop, i.e. income decreases larger than 30% from the expected income.====The interest of policy-makers for the IST is due to four major reasons. First, farmers protection under the IST focuses on the key variable of interest, i.e. income. This represents the economic wellbeing of a farm household much better than revenues of a single commodity and implicitly accounts for various correlations between prices and yields and across profits of different farm activities (Meuwissen, Huirne, & Skees, 2003; Severini et al., 2016a). Second, IST is in agreement with WTO green-box requirements (e.g. Mary, Santini, & Boulanger, 2013). Third, IST has the potential to cover also systemic risks (specifically price risk) that are not covered by purely commercial insurances hampering the principles of risk pooling (Meuwissen et al., 2003). Fourth, the tools support a public–private partnership because farmers must be organised in mutual funds (MF) and have to cover part of the indemnity costs (i.e. at least 35% of these) as well as management costs incurred by the MF.====There is now a large amount of explorative research on the farm-, sector- and country-level effects of IST. This literature focuses on actuarial evaluations of a potential income insurance, its governmental costs, potential beneficiaries within the farm population as well as conceptual studies on problems of adverse selection and moral hazard with such whole-farm income insurance tools (dell’Aquila and Cimino, 2012, El Benni et al., 2016, Finger and El Benni, 2014a, Finger and El Benni, 2014b, Liesivaara and Myyrä, 2016a; Liesivaara, Myyräae, & Jaakkola, 2012; Mary et al., 2013; Pigeon, de Frahan, & Denuit, 2014).====This research has shown that the introduction of such tool: (i) stabilizes farm-incomes (Finger & El Benni, 2014a), (ii) affects the income inequality within the farm population (Finger & El Benni, 2014a), (iii) the benefits from such tool might be highly heterogeneous across farm types (El Benni et al. 2016), (iv) causes highly volatile levels of indemnification payments, requiring large buffers (Pigeon et al. 2014), (v) might cause large transaction costs (Liesivaara et al., 2012), (vi) indemnification patterns are highly dependent on the calculation of the reference income (Finger & El Benni, 2014b), (vii) might cause moral hazard problems along value chains (Liesivaara & Myyrä, 2016a).====The conducted research, however, remained on conceptual levels, without explicit aspects on implementation issues. This observation is also due to the fact that, despite the potential appeal of this tool, IST has not been implemented yet in EU Member States. Now, however, first countries and regions declared interest in establishing IST: Italy, Hungary and the Spanish region Castilla y León (Bardají & Garrido, 2016). Important steps towards implementation that have not been addressed in empirical research so far are: (i) the specification of aspects concerning the structure of mutual funds (MF) across sectors and space and (ii) the specification of farmers’ contribution to MF. These decisions could affect income stabilizing properties, viability of mutual funds, income inequality in the agricultural sector and the distribution of benefits across space and farm types. These issues have, for instance in Italy, led to a postponement of the implementation of the IST (ISMEA, 2015, Trestini and Boatto, 2015; Trestini, Szathvary, Pomarici, & Boatto, 2018).====Opting against a single national mutual fund but focus on specific sectors and/or regions has several advantages. Already existing institutions (e.g. Producer Organizations) could be used to facilitate the establishment of a MF and increase the likelihood of an agreement among farmers. Moreover, such MF would have a more detailed knowledge about the participating farmers and could thus better manage moral hazard problems. Thus, there are substantially lower transaction costs expected for low aggregation levels. Finally, such disaggregation implies a limited redistribution of benefits (as well as costs) of the policy among different sectors and regions, which is an important aspect for the acceptance of such policy. A potential limitation when MF operate on a specific sector and specific regions, is that it may not be possible to effectively pool risks because the underlying risks are systemic. For example, when only a small region or a specific sector is addressed, all farms may be affected by the systemic weather risk or the same market risk. Under these circumstances, this causes large indemnification events within a MF, requires large buffers and/or re-insurance, which increases costs.====Another important issue is how farmers should pay the contributions, i.e. premiums, to the MF. Farms might contribute to the IST using flat-rate premium levels (Finger & El Benni, 2014a), or contribute according to income or risk levels. The choice on farmers’ contribution will have implications for the costs and risk reducing effects of the IST.====We illustrate the effects of the specification of MF and farmers’ contributions on the variability of farm income and the distribution of benefits of IST among the farm population using the example of Italian agriculture in a unique empirical analysis. Thus, we contribute an empirical analysis that feeds directly into ongoing policy debates in Italy on the implementation of the IST. Moreover, shedding light into these implementation aspects constitutes an important basis for policy decisions also in other countries.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Only under a relatively high labour supply elasticity the observed UK tax rate fares well in equalizing opportunities for income attainment.","Considerations of individual responsibility and opportunity increasingly have been introduced into formal economic theories that evaluate social states. The economic literature on Equality of opportunity (henceforth EO) explicitly builds on this new approach to egalitarianism, and transpires from ====, introducing personal responsibility as an important qualifier of the degree of equality that is ethically desirable.==== According to ====, EO has become ‘the most prevailing conception of social justice in contemporary western societies’.====The key feature of responsibility-sensitive egalitarian theories is the idea that an equitable society is not necessarily a society that ensures all its citizens are equally rich or educated, but rather a society that ensures all its citizens have equal opportunities to attain the outcomes they care about. The development of this egalitarian theory is therefore characterized by shifting the focus from equality of outcomes to opportunities. This paper intends to evaluate the tax-and-transfer system of the UK between 1991 and 2008 with respect to the policy objective of EO. It bases its analysis on Roemer’s theory of EO, which suggests that fiscal policies must only redress inequalities of income due to circumstances beyond the individual’s control, leaving inequalities arising due to choices for which individuals are deemed responsible untouched.====Fiscal policies warranted under EO can serve as an important benchmark for policy makers when designing public policies. This analysis helps to identify those circumstances which most hinder citizens in their income attainment, and serves as a means to prioritize those groups of society which are most in need in fiscal policy. Fiscal policies based on EO can thereby improve the targeting of these groups.====We use the framework in ==== to determine both observed and EO policies. The empirical analysis applies this framework to different individual circumstances to investigate the extent to which these circumstances influence income acquisition across time. We compute the tax-and-transfer regime which would equalize opportunities, as far as possible, across citizens under each circumstance. Our empirical analysis uses data from the ==== (BHPS), observing roughly 5000 individuals from the UK for the time period of 1991 to 2008.====In short, the results suggest that if UK fiscal policy intends to equalize opportunities for income acquisition across citizens, policymakers should pay more attention to redress inequalities arising due to differences in gender as well as family background. We show that the extent to which the UK fiscal policy equalizes opportunities for income attainment depends on the societal judgment of relevant circumstances and the labour supply elasticity.====The outline of the paper is as follows. Section ==== recapitulates the main features of Roemer’s theory of equality of opportunity. Section ==== presents the theoretical framework by formalizing the fiscal policy required to attain EO. Our empirical strategy is outlined in section ====, presenting a description of the data and methodological considerations. Section ==== presents the results. Section ==== closes with a discussion of the results and the final conclusions.","Inequality of opportunity in the United Kingdom, 1991–2008",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300857,1 July 2019,2019,Research Article,358.0
