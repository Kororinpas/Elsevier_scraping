In the absence of an entitlement to housing assistance, an underexplored cause of the shortfall is that higher rents in some areas driven by supply-constraining local regulations increase program costs, leaving fewer funds available to serve additional families. In this paper, we simulate the effect of increasing housing supply on the cost of Section 8 housing assistance programs in Los Angeles, as well as all 11 ","Among the 43 million renter households in the United States in 2019, 24 percent paid more than half of their income on rent (authors’ calculations based on the 2019 American Housing Survey). Families that dedicate higher shares of resources to rent are more likely to be threatened with eviction (authors’ calculations based on the 2017 American Housing Survey), and communities where rents represent a greater share of income have higher rates of homelessness (Glynn et al., 2021). In an effort to alleviate housing cost burdens of low-income households, the federal government spends over $50 billion annually on rental housing assistance programs, which require families to contribute approximately 30 percent of their incomes to rent with the federal government covering the remaining portion (Collinson et al., 2019). Large-scale randomized experiments have shown that the receipt of rental housing assistance sharply reduces housing instability and homelessness (Wood et al., 2008; Gubits et al., 2016). However, only about one in four families who qualify for rental assistance receive it (Collinson et al., 2019), leaving many low-income families at risk of adverse housing outcomes. The funding shortfall occurs because rental housing assistance is not an entitlement program, and Congress does not appropriate sufficient funds to cover all eligible families given the programs’ benefit standards.====In the absence of an entitlement to housing assistance for all who qualify, one factor that contributes to the large share of eligible families who do not receive assistance is local land use and building regulations that drive up rents and, as a result, the federal cost of covering each family. These regulations restrict the supply of new housing, forcing prices to rise when demand for housing expands. Regulations that can drive up home prices include, for example, burdensome permitting and review procedures, large minimum lot sizes, low maximum building heights, historic preservation requirements, restrictive zoning rules, restrictions on growth in the housing stock, and parking requirements.====We provide to our knowledge the first estimates of the effect of relaxing local housing market regulations on the federal cost of rental housing assistance programs and the additional number of families who could be served with these savings. We first explain the simple reason why local regulations that drive up rents can dramatically increase program costs: Every one dollar increase in market rent increases the federal cost of housing assistance by one dollar, since recipients pay the same amount—approximately 30 percent of their income—regardless of the market rent. As long as tenants contribute a nonzero amount for rent, then the percent reduction in the federal cost to serve a family always exceeds the percent reduction in market rent.====We simulate the cost savings from housing supply increases driven by deregulation in Los Angeles, chosen due to its stringent land use regulations and large number of families served by federal rental assistance programs. To do so, we first simulate housing production in Los Angeles equal to the housing production rate in the 90th percentile metropolitan area and translate the supply increase into a market rent reduction after one decade of additional building. We next use data on the number and characteristics of recipients of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program and the Section 8 Project-based housing assistance program (which both assist tenants who live in private market apartments, unlike public housing) to estimate program savings that would arise from these rent reductions. We account for wage reductions due to increased labor supply when housing supply increases, which would reduce recipient contributions to rent and thus offset a portion of government savings.====We estimate that in Los Angeles, the market rent would fall by 18.1 percent under our preferred price elasticities of demand, used to translate increased construction into price decreases. This rent reduction would lead to a government savings of $352.8 million annually (19.2 percent) for the Section 8 programs. These savings could then be used to serve nearly 34,000 (23.8 percent) more families who have the same characteristics of current recipient families. If instead of housing supply increases driven by relaxed regulations, housing were added via a doubling of units placed in service over the course of a decade by the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)—a federal initiative that offers tax incentives for building housing affordable to low and moderate income families—the market rent would fall by only 0.9 percent, federal savings would be $18.4 million, and the Section 8 programs could increase the number of families served by 1.0 percent. The much lower cost savings from LIHTC expansions is in part due to crowd-out of market rate housing. We also show how results vary for Los Angeles when varying assumptions on housing production due to relaxed regulations, the price elasticities of demand, and the crowd-out rate of LIHTC. Finally, we simulate, under our preferred assumptions, effects of relaxed regulations and LIHTC expansions in other areas. Across the 11 most supply constrained metropolitan areas in the United States, increased construction due to the relaxation of supply constraining regulations for a decade would lead to a federal savings of $1.831 billion and increase the number of families served by 18.6 percent. Doubling the number of units placed in service through LIHTC in these 11 metropolitan areas would lead to savings of $231.3 million, and increase the number of families served by 2.1 percent.====While this is the first paper to our knowledge that estimates the effect of local regulation on the cost of federal rental housing assistance programs, it relates to other research that evaluates the effects of the design of rental housing assistance programs on their cost-effectiveness at achieving desired outcomes (see Olsen 2003 and Collinson et al., 2016 for reviews). Relatedly, Collinson and Ganong (2018) show that varying the maximum value of vouchers across neighborhoods leads assisted tenants to live in higher quality neighborhoods. And a number of studies assess the impact of the Moving to Opportunity experiment which helped public housing residents move to higher quality neighborhoods (e.g., Chetty et al., 2016).====Others have studied the impacts of local housing regulations on home prices (e.g., Quigley and Raphael 2005; Glaeser et al., 2005; Glaeser and Ward 2009; Saiz 2010; Albouy and Ehrlich 2018), national output growth (Hsieh and Moretti 2019), regional economic convergence (Ganong and Shoag 2017), fertility (Shoag and Russell 2018) and homelessness (Raphael 2010; Council of Economic Advisers 2020), among other outcomes. Our paper adds another consequence of local housing regulations that constrain supply to this body of literature—higher costs for federal rental housing assistance programs and thus fewer families served. Finally, Ericksen and Ross (2015) find that housing assistance tends to increase market rents in supply constrained areas due to an increase in demand in conjunction with inelastic supply. This implies that supply-constraining regulations not only increase the cost of providing federal housing assistance to recipients (as we show), but these supply constraints also cause housing assistance programs to increase the market rents for recipients and non-recipients alike.====This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 summarizes the key rental assistance programs in the United States. Section 3 provides a simple example of how higher rents due to local regulations can dramatically increase the cost of serving families with these programs. Section 4 simulates the effects of increasing housing production on federal cost savings and additional families served in Los Angeles. Section 5 considers supply constrained areas across the United States.

This paper examines this important question, evaluating how Argentine provinces adapted some of their fiscal policies in response to revenue changes between 1988 and 2003.====Argentina is an interesting case study for two reasons. First, this country is highly decentralized, so provinces have a lot of latitude in spending. Second, provinces get their revenue from different sources: own-source taxes, national funding paid out in intergovernmental transfers, and, in some jurisdictions, natural resource royalties.====Since 1988, intergovernmental transfers have been regulated by the legal tax-sharing regime called ====. This law stipulated that most of the taxes collected by the national government constituted a common pool, the ====; of this pool, a fraction was retained by the national government, and the remainder had to be shared among all provinces by means of Coparticipation transfers. From 1988 to 2003, Coparticipation transfers represented an average of 94 percent of all intergovernmental transfers in Argentina.====At the same time, revenues originating from hydrocarbon production were mainly determined by international energy prices without any discretionary intervention of the national government, and comprised more than 95 percent of all natural resource royalties in Argentina. However, this high percentage of royalties was concentrated among a small number of provinces that produced hydrocarbons.====These particular features of Argentine fiscal federalism enable us to explore the initial question from two different empirical angles. First, how do provinces react to shocks to Coparticipation transfers, the ==== source of revenue for all of them? Second, how do hydrocarbon-producing provinces respond to shocks to their ==== sources of revenue?====For this purpose, we estimate two equations, specifying provincial reactions in public consumption and debt to contemporaneous and lagged changes in Coparticipation transfers and royalties. To address some issues that may invalidate the key assumption that shocks to both sources of revenue were truly exogenous, we adopt a Bartik-like instrumental variables approach.==== First, we instrument Coparticipation transfers using fixed provincial shares interacted with annual changes in the common pool ====. In order to assess whether such an instrument satisfies the exclusion restriction, we follow Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020) and establish that the aforementioned shares were not correlated with many observable provincial socio-economic characteristics in 1988. Second, we instrument royalties employing an index of provincial hydrocarbon abundance in the pre-estimation period interacted with annual changes in the international oil price. We provide evidence that from 1988 to 2003, these changes did not directly affect the economy of hydrocarbon-producing provinces, suggesting that the instrument influenced public policies only through royalties.====When provinces faced an increase in Coparticipation transfers, they mainly increased public consumption and, to a lesser extent, reduced their debt. In particular, the increase in public consumption was assigned to payroll (50 percent), transfers to the public and private sectors (35 percent), and procurement (15 percent). These results are robust to different estimation methods, alternative specifications of the basic regressions, and the inclusion of some controls.====Because only a few provinces earn natural resources royalties, and the majority of this revenue went to only eight provinces, we next proceed to run the same two regressions, but only for hydrocarbon-producing provinces. We confirm that these provinces behaved like the others, spending any increase in Coparticipation transfers solely to raise public consumption. However, when they experienced an increase in royalties, hydrocarbon-producing provinces reacted in the exact opposite direction: they used it entirely to cut down their debt, without modifying public consumption.====We provide two plausible explanations for these sharp differences in fiscal responses among hydrocarbon-producing provinces. First, we observe that the volatility of royalties was higher than the volatility of Coparticipation transfers. Therefore, the decision of these provinces to save a greater percentage of any increase of their most volatile source of revenue could be explained by a precautionary savings argument. Second, we present evidence that these particular provinces were in a mature phase of their hydrocarbon production curve, far from both the initiation of exploitation and depletion. Hence, according to the literature on the optimal use of revenue from nonrenewable natural resources, hydrocarbon-producing provinces were likely to save most of their royalties.====Next, we investigate if there is any evidence in the data pointing to one of these two explanations as the cause of such behavior. We were not able to detect any effect of the different volatilities of both revenue sources on the fiscal reactions of hydrocarbon-producing provinces. However, we found a significant positive relationship between changes in the depletion index and how much these provinces save when they experience increases in royalties. To the very best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution to the local public finance literature that has detected such a relationship, which is consistent with optimal fiscal reactions in mature hydrocarbon-producing jurisdictions that are situated at the increasing part of their production curve.====This paper is related to many local public finance contributions that empirically analyze the reactions of subnational governments to changes in their income streams as guided by intertemporal considerations (see Holtz-Eakin, Rosen, 1991, Dahlberg, Lindström, 1998) and paying close attention to the identification strategy (e.g., Knight, 2002, Dahlberg, Mörk, Rattsø, Ågren, 2008).==== We build on these contributions by separately estimating expenditure and debt response to contemporaneous and lagged changes in provincial income sources. We instrument these changes by adopting a Bartik-like approach to address their endogeneity. We find statistical evidence that Argentine provincial governments displayed a high and persistent consumption sensitivity to Coparticipation transfers.====By including hydrocarbons royalties, our study ties in with a relatively new stream of papers that evaluate the existence of a ==== at the subnational level. Specifically, Caselli and Michaels (2013); Borge et al. (2015); Cassidy (2021); Andersen and Sørensen (2022); Maldonado and Ardanaz (2022), and Martínez (2023), among others, investigate if public revenues originating from the exploitation of natural resources are misused by local authorities and thus induce poor socio-economic, political outcomes. Their approach address the potential problems of omitted variable biases pervasive in previous contributions.==== Examining provinces within a single country avoids concerns about potentially heterogeneous environments across different countries; basic institutional aspects of political bodies are likely to be less variant (across both sectional units and time) within one country than between multiple countries. In addition, these papers have made an effort to find more exogenous measures of natural resource abundance.====In fact, Cust and Viale (2016) report that the evidence for such poor outcomes in these subnational units is mixed; it is far from being a generalized phenomenon, even in developing countries. Indeed, Borge et al. (2015); Cassidy (2021); Andersen and Sørensen (2022), and Maldonado and Ardanaz (2022) do not find compelling evidence of the subnational resource curse or even report that local policies generate positive results. Our results contribute to the growing skepticism regarding the alleged prevalence of this phenomenon.====From a methodological point of view, the papers closest to ours are Martínez (2023) and Cassidy (2021). These two papers also evaluate fiscal reactions to shocks to different sources of income. Martínez (2023) looks at spending and investment reactions to changes in local taxation and royalties in Colombia. He instruments local taxation using cadastral updates, and he instruments royalties in a similar fashion as we do. Martínez’s findings suggest the existence of a subnational resource curse in this country: increases in property tax revenue have a larger impact on the provision of local public services than comparable changes in royalties do, observing that changes in royalties lead to a higher probability that the municipal mayor will face disciplinary prosecution. Cassidy (2021) uses a natural experiment of a permanent adjustment to the general grant transferred by the government of Indonesia to subnational governments. Regarding the provision of public goods, he compares the fiscal response to this permanent change against the response to transitory shifts in oil revenue. He finds that the increase in permanent income induces more expenditure in lumpy public goods (e.g., investment), while changes in volatile revenues have little or no fiscal effects. Our results are similar in that, at least during the period under analysis, hydrocarbon-producing provinces allocated increases in Coparticipation transfers only towards public consumption, but never did so following increases in royalties.====Finally, although Végh and Vuletin (2015) also deal with intergovernmental fiscal relations in Argentina, our paper differs in many aspects from theirs. Their main goal is to examine whether uncertainty and insurance arguments, and the resulting precautionary savings behavior, can be consistent with a flypaper effect at the provincial level. Accordingly, they merely study expenditure reactions to changes in national transfers and local taxes. On the other hand, we further assess the provincial governments’ intertemporal behavior by estimating how public debt changed as a result of shocks to their revenue. Moreover, by including royalties, our paper highlights the specificity of hydrocarbon-producing provinces in Argentina and thus relates our work to the aforementioned subnational resource curse literature. Finally, Végh and Vuletin (2015) consider the 1966–2016 period, which includes various adjustments to the tax-sharing regime. To deal with this issue, they use provincial representation in Congress as an instrument for intergovernmental transfers. By contrast, between 1988 and 2003, a unique legal tax-sharing regime was in place that fixed the secondary distribution coefficients. We use this fact to build a Bartik-type instrument for Coparticipation transfers. This methodological difference may explain why, although qualitatively similar, our results concerning increases in Coparticipation transfers are more nuanced than those found by these authors.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe provincial public finances in Argentina. In Section 3, we conceptualize our underlying model and discuss the identification strategy, particularly the instrumental variables approach that we use. In Section 4, we empirically estimate how fiscal policies react to changes in the different sources of public revenue in all provinces. Section 5 studies these same fiscal reactions, but only in hydrocarbon-producing provinces. We suggest some plausible explanations for their observed behavior and present evidence regarding the presence of one of the mechanisms in the data. We discuss our findings and then conclude in Section 6. In the Appendix, we present additional results.

In this paper, we show that these two premia are closely linked by documenting a new fact: when workers move to a large city, they also move to larger establishments. We then ask how much of the city-size earnings premium can be attributed to transitions to larger and better-paying establishments. Using administrative data from Spain, we find that 38 percent of the city-size earnings premium can be explained by establishment-size composition. Most of the gains from the transition to larger establishments realize in the short-term upon moving to the large city. Establishment size explains 29 percent of the short-term gains, but only 5 percent of the medium-term gains that accrue as workers gain experience in the large city. The small contribution to the medium-term gains is due to two facts: first, within large cities workers transition to large establishments only slightly faster than in smaller cities; second, the relationship between earnings and establishment size is weaker in large cities.","Large cities are places of opportunities. They offer workers both higher wages and faster wage growth over their careers. Understanding what makes large cities so attractive for workers is a primary goal of urban economics, and a large literature has been devoted to understanding the drivers of the city-size earnings premium—the statistical relationship between earnings and city size.==== A separate literature has been devoted to understanding the establishment-size earnings premium—the statistical relationship between earnings and establishment size.==== In this paper, we show that the two premia are closely related. We document that when workers move to larger cities, they also move to larger establishments. Hence, part of the benefit of living in a larger city is due to working at a larger establishment. We ask how much of the city-size earnings premium can be attributed to workers’ transitions to better-paying, larger establishments.====To answer this question, we use administrative data on worker-level earnings histories in Spain, and quantify how much of the city-size earnings premium can be explained by establishment size. We find that 38.2 percent of the average earnings gains from moving to a larger city can be attributed to the transition to larger establishments. Part of these gains materialize immediately—the short-term earnings gains—and part will accrue over time as workers accumulate experience in the large city—the medium-term earnings gains.==== We examine the role of establishment size in generating the short- and medium-term gains separately. We find that the change in establishment size accounts for 29.4 percent of the short-term gains, but only accounts for 4.88 percent of the medium-term gains.====Our results shed light on the drivers of the city-size earnings premium. The quantitative importance of establishment size suggests that the city-size earnings premium may be driven by the same mechanisms that generate the establishment-size premium, such as monopsony power, efficiency wages, and rent sharing (Hirsch et al., 2019). However, these theories appear less essential for explaining the medium-term earnings gains of living in a large city. Instead, the medium-term gains are likely to be driven by agglomeration forces typically put forth in the urban economics literature (Henderson, 2003, Duranton, Puga, 2004, Rosenthal, Strange, 2004), such as learning or thicker matching markets, which do not rely on workers moving to larger establishments.====We start by documenting three stylized facts. First, we document the well-known city-size earnings premium. We find that workers in cities twice as large earn, on average, 5.12 percent more, in line with the findings of De la Roca and Puga (2017) using the same data. Second, we establish what we call the ====,==== namely that a worker at an establishment with twice as many co-workers, earns 4.85 percent more on average.==== Third, we document the ====—the fact that workers in large cities work at larger establishments. The city-size co-worker premium is large; a worker in a city twice as large can expect 26.4 percent more co-workers.====We combine these facts to decompose the average city-size earnings premium into the contribution from increasing the number of co-workers and a remaining “city-premium” not explained by the change in establishment size. Using the average co-worker earnings premium, we find that out of the total 1.63 percent increase in earnings from moving to a city twice as large after controlling for observable and unobservable characteristics of the worker, 38.2 percent is associated with workers moving to larger establishments.====Next, we move beyond the average city-size earnings premium to investigate the role of the establishment size in both the short-term and the medium-term city-size earnings premium. The short-term earnings gains are defined as the average increase in earnings upon moving to a larger city for a worker with no previous work experience, while the medium-term gains account for the increase in earnings accumulated over time as a worker gains experience in the large city. In order to distinguish between short- and medium-term gains, we include city-specific experience variables to control for experience accumulated in larger cities. Controlling for past experience, we find that moving to a city twice as large is associated with a short-term increase in earnings of 1.87 percent.==== If we further control for the number of co-workers, we find that the increase in earnings falls to 1.32 percent. Therefore, the transition to larger establishments accounts for 29.4 percent of the short-term city-size earnings premium.====Finally, we explore the role of transitions between establishments of different sizes in explaining the medium-term earnings gains offered by large cities. We find that after 9.4 years of experience in a city twice as large, which is the average experience in our sample, workers benefit from an additional 1.17 percent increase in earnings. This is in line with the findings in De la Roca and Puga (2017), who first documented the medium-term gains for Spain.====There is substantial heterogeneity in the co-worker earnings premium across cities. In Utrera, the smallest city in our sample, the co-worker earnings premium is more than twice as large as the premium in Madrid, the largest city.==== This novel fact dampens the role of establishment size in contributing to the medium-term city-size earnings premium. While workers in large cities move to large establishments slightly faster, they receive a smaller earnings premium as they move up the establishment-size distribution. As a result, only 4.88 percent of the medium-term earnings gains in larger cities can be attributed to a faster growth in the number of co-workers. Therefore, the medium-term gains are mainly driven by mechanisms that operate for a given establishment size. Finally, we also explore heterogeneity in the city-size co-worker premium across sectors. One might expect that establishments are larger in large cities simply due to market size effects. However, we find that the city-size co-worker premium is remarkably constant across tradable and non-tradable sectors suggesting that market size is unlikely to be the driver.====Our analysis allows us to gauge the importance of establishment size in the city-size earnings premium. However, we do not interpret our exercise as providing causal estimates of the role of establishment size on earnings across cities. In each of the relationships we examine, reverse causality and omitted variables are potential sources of bias to a causal estimate. For example, when studying the role of city size on the number of co-workers, unobserved local productivity effects could simultaneously lead firms and cities to be larger (Manning, 2010). In addition, there may be firm-level productivity effects, with more productive firms being both larger and offering higher wages. In the absence of a precise measure of productivity in our dataset, we follow much of the literature and consider an establishment’s number of co-workers as a key characteristic that is easily observable, tightly linked to unobserved productivity (Combes, Duranton, Gobillon, Puga, Roux, 2012, Mion, Naticchioni, 2009), and directly relevant for several important theories of firm wage setting, such as monopsonistic labor markets (Manning, 2010) and efficiency wages (Brown and Medoff, 1989).====This paper primarily contributes to the literature on the city-size and establishment-size earnings premia. Although the two premia are typically associated with different mechanisms and separate streams of literature, we show that they are closely related since workers systematically move to larger establishments when they move to larger cities.====While providing a joint theory of the city-size and establishment-size earnings premia is beyond the scope of this paper, the empirical results we provide can be used to distinguish between existing theories and guide future research. First, the important role of establishment size in accounting for the city-size earnings premium suggests that a successful theory of agglomeration needs to explain the presence of larger, more productive firms in large cities.==== Second, the theory needs to account for differences in the establishment-size earnings premium across cities. Third, a successful theory would need to account for the limited role of establishment size in generating the medium-term gains of living in a large city. Taken together, these three facts may be satisfied by a model in which firms sort to large cities where they will face a more elastic labor supply curve, as in Manning (2010).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Spanish administrative data and presents the methodology we use for the main decomposition exercise. Section 3 starts by documenting three stylized facts on the co-worker earnings premium, the city-size earnings premium, and the city-size co-worker premium. Then it presents the main results decomposing the city-size earnings premium into the city premium and the co-worker premium. In Section 4, we examine heterogeneity in the city-size co-worker premium across sectors and heterogeneity in the co-worker earnings premium across cities. In both cases, we discuss the implications of this heterogeneity for the main decomposition exercises.",JUE insight: The role of establishment size in the city-size earnings premium,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119023000256,Available online 1 June 2023,2023,Research Article,2.0

This paper provides empirical evidence to further inform debate by examining the various impacts of recently implemented zoning reforms on housing construction in Auckland, the largest ","Housing has become prohibitively expensive in many of the world’s major cities, precipitating serious and widespread housing affordability crises (Wetzstein, 2017). A growing coalition of researchers argue that part of the solution is to “upzone” cities by relaxing land use regulations (LURs) to allow construction of more intensive housing, such as townhouses, terrace housing and apartment buildings (Glaeser, Gyourko, 2003, Freeman, Schuetz, 2017, Manville, Monkkonen, Lens, 2019). Policymakers have begun to listen to these supply-side solutions and, in response, several metropolitan and gubernatorial authorities have pursued zoning reform in recent years (National Public Radio, 2019).====These policy reforms are underpinned by==== the argument that LURs increase house prices by restricting housing supply (Glaeser, Gyourko, Saks, 2005, Quigley, Raphael, 2005, Quigley, Rosenthal, 2005, Ihlanfeldt, 2007, Zabel, Dalton, 2011, Gyourko, Molloy, 2015). Relaxing those regulations through upzoning, it is argued, enables new more intensive development, thereby increasing housing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. However, these arguments are not universally accepted and many commentators remain skeptical of the capacity for these market-led policies to deliver affordable and inclusive housing (Rodríguez-Pose, Storper, 2020, Wetzstein, 2021). Instead it is suggested that government intervention is needed to tackle the problem through means such as state-led construction (Wetzstein, 2021, Favilukis, Stijn, Nieuwerburgh, Mabille, Nieuwerburgh, 2023), the repurposing of public space (Wetzstein, 2021, Freemark, 2021), and policies that limit demand (Wetzstein, 2021).====Unfortunately our understanding of the manifold impact of upzoning is presently limited by an acute lack of empirical research on the subject (Schill, 2005, Freeman, Schuetz, 2017, Freemark, 2019). Only a handful of studies have offered empirical evidence of the effects of a relaxation of LURs (Atkinson-Palombo, 2010, Freemark, 2019, Gray, Millsap, 2020, Limb, Murray, 2022, Peng), and these have tended to concentrate on small-scale policy changes, often involving transit-oriented rezoning, not the large-scale policy reforms currently being implemented in many US cities.==== The limited empirical work that is available has findings that often contravene the outcomes anticipated by proponents of supply-side regulatory reforms. For example, Freemark (2019) found that transit-oriented upzoning in Chicago failed to encourage construction, calling into question the fundamental premise of the supply-side argument (Rodríguez-Pose and Storper, 2020). Meanwhile, Limb and Murray (2022) argue that transit-oriented upzoning in Brisbane, Australia, generated no significant increase in housing construction.====The lack of empirical evidence on the effects of large-scale upzoning is largely due to the fact that, until very recently, no city has systematically upzoned large shares of land as a mechanism to promote affordability (Freeman and Schuetz, 2017, p. 229). In 2016, however, the city of Auckland, New Zealand, implemented large-scale zoning reforms under the Auckland Unitary Plan (AUP). Motivated in part by housing affordability concerns (Auckland Unitary Plan Independent Hearings Panel, 2016), the plan upzoned approximately three-quarters of residential land, and trebled the number of dwellings that could be built (Greenaway-McGrevy et al., 2021), providing researchers with a unique opportunity to study large-scale upzoning reform of the kind that was hitherto lacking.====The present paper examines impact of upzoning on housing construction in Auckland to provide further evidence on whether zoning reforms can fulfill the fundamental premise of the supply-side policy response, namely, that upzoning increases housing supply. A difference-in-differences (DID) framework is adopted that exploits geographic variation in the incidence of upzoning to estimate causal effects through the comparison of outcomes in upzoned residential areas with outcomes in non-upzoned residential areas. Our dataset consists of geocoded building permits that are matched to planning maps that detail the geographic incidence and intensity of upzoning.==== Because the empirical design exploits temporal changes in zoning rules via a policy intervention, it has the capacity to mitigate many of the concerns stemming from the endogeneity of regulations that afflict studies which rely only on spatial variation in LURs (Gyourko and Molloy, 2015). By exploiting time series and spatial variation in LURs, we are able to allow for a wider set of time-invariant confounders since their impact on outcomes is differenced out in the DID procedure. The approach is concordant with other work where changes in the geographic variation in zoning has been used in quasi-experimental designs to examine casual impacts (Thorson, 1997, Cunningham, 2006, Zhou, McMillen, McDonald, 2008, Kahn, Vaughn, Zasloff, 2010, Freemark, 2019).====Our empirical strategy pays particular attention to the possibility that housing construction in upzoned areas displaced housing that would have otherwise been constructed in non-upzoned areas.==== These displacement effects would manifest as negative spillovers from treatment areas to control areas, violating the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) in the Neyman-Rubin causal framework, and generating an overstatement of conventional treatment effects that are based on simple comparisons of outcomes in treatment and control groups. Present techniques for addressing spatial spillover effects require the spillovers to be localized, in the sense that the magnitude of the spillover between geographically distant areas is assumed to be negligible (Clarke, 2017, Butts, Huber, Steinmayr, 2021). As we demonstrate below, the evidence suggests that upzoning in Auckland reallocated permits over large distances (from distant areas with more vacant land to near areas with less vacant land), meaning that methods that model spillovers under the assumption that they are highly localized and dissipate with distance are untenable in our setting. We therefore develop an approach to accommodating spillover effects that does not rely on spillovers dissipating with distance.====We adapt the set identification approach suggested by Rambachan and Roth (2023) (hereafter “RR”) for remediating violations of the standard parallel trends assumption that is required under the DID framework. RR extrapolate pre-treatment trends to generate a set of counterfactual outcomes in the treatment group. In the present paper we repurpose this strategy by using pre-treatment trends in the ==== group to extrapolate a set of counterfactual outcomes that are used to bound the magnitude of the spillover effect. The intuition underpinning both the RR strategy and our strategy is the idea that observed trends immediately prior to the policy intervention are informative of the counterfactual scenario. Adapting the RR method to our application yields a confidence set of treatment effects that is robust to spillover effects and amenable to inference.====The empirical findings using this methodology reveal strong statistical evidence that upzoning increased housing construction. Our preferred model specification shows a statistically significant increase in permits even under counterfactual sets that span approximately four times the extrapolated linear trend in the control group. For example, a linear trend fitted to pre-treatment observations in the control group implies that 1116 additional permits in non-upzoned areas in 2021 under the counterfactual of no upzoning. We find that the estimated treatment effect for 2021 remains statistically significant even when we allow an additional 4469 permits in the counterfactual set of outcomes. Put differently, counterfactual scenarios that allow more than a four-fold increase in permits over the pre-treatment trend (since 4 ≈ 4.005 = 4469/1116) would be needed in order for the estimated treatment effects to become statistically insignificant. There is no policy change concurrent to the upzoning policy that could plausibly generate such a substantial increase in construction.====We also use the extrapolated counterfactual trend in control areas to generate a point estimate of the number of additional permits enabled through upzoning. To do so, we restrict the counterfactual set to the extrapolated linear trend, so that the set collapses to a point. This approach implies that 21,808 additional dwellings were permitted over the five years following the zoning reform, corresponding to approximately 4.11% of the dwelling stock of the Auckland region.====Our results have implications for ongoing debates about the efficacy of upzoning. In particular, the findings support the view that large-scale upzoning can encourage construction. This is particularly important in the light of recent work by Freemark (2019) and Limb and Murray (2022), who find that zoning changes had minimal impact on housing construction in Chicago and Brisbane, respectively. Further work examining potential mediating factors that enabled increased construction will hopefully help explain why the policy was more effective in Auckland, and assist policymakers in tailoring rezoning and housing policies to facilitate construction elsewhere.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section two provides the background institutional context and timeline of the key events in the city of Auckland and Section three describes the dataset used in our empirical work.

We examine these questions and the coverage of new microdata sources that are designed to be nationally representative. We compare two restricted data sources largely unused to study homelessness, the 2010 Census and American ","Despite widespread concern about those experiencing homelessness, many of the most basic questions about this population, including the first-order question of population size, are unresolved. Relatedly, the extent to which the Decennial Census and Census Bureau surveys include those experiencing homelessness is unclear in Census documentation and publications, and the empirical extent of coverage has not been examined. In this paper, we compare two restricted data sources that have been largely unused to study homelessness to administrative shelter records and less detailed public data. We also develop a new approach to estimating the size of the sheltered homeless population by linking together Census and administrative shelter microdata, an approach that under our stated assumptions provides a reliable estimate of the true population. We evaluate the usefulness of these datasets to advance our understanding of this difficult-to-study group and lay the foundation for pathbreaking future work using these data.====Efforts to count the U.S. homeless population confront substantial challenges. Because people experiencing homelessness lack a fixed domicile, they cannot be counted using standard address list-based approaches like those most often used in the Census and household surveys. They must instead be counted in the shelters, soup kitchens, encampments, vehicles, or parks where they happen to be staying at a given time. This difficulty is at times compounded by mistrust of authorities, mental illness or substance abuse, involvement in the underground economy, local ordinances that restrict activities associated with homelessness, or other factors that contribute to a desire not to be found (Corinth, 2015, Glasser et al., 2013).====Given these difficulties, the reliability of available estimates, particularly the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s point-in-time (PIT) count, is frequently called into question. The PIT is widely cited in the media and often used to allocate resources and inform policy, yet the handful of existing studies on its quality have been limited in geography and scope and are outdated (Hopper et al., 2008; Agans et al., 2014). A 2020 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the PIT “did not provide a reliably precise estimate of the homeless population,” in part, according to the report, because of the decentralized and non-uniform way that local bodies carry out their counting operations. O'Flaherty (2019) observes that PIT data on the unsheltered homeless population are largely gathered by a “loosely supervised army of amateur volunteers” whose “diligence, understanding of the process, and lack of bias are all open to question.” The completeness and coverage of shelter-use microdata, which are employed in the PIT's sheltered homeless estimates, have gone largely unstudied. By comparing the PIT's estimate of the U.S. homeless population to independent estimates, this paper provides the most comprehensive assessment to date of the quality of both the aggregate PIT and the microdata underlying its sheltered population estimates.====Our approach draws on restricted microdata from the 2010 Census, the American Community Survey (ACS), and Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) databases from Los Angeles and Houston. The ACS and HMIS include people in homeless shelters, while the Census includes both sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals. We compare these restricted data to each other and to HUD's PIT estimates and the Housing Inventory Count (HIC). Our restricted data have important advantages over public data. Like the PIT, the ACS and Census are designed to be representative of the entire U.S. homeless population. Unlike the PIT, however, the Census, ACS, and HMIS include individual linkage keys so that the microdata can be linked across sources and to administrative data to examine longitudinally a range of social and economic characteristics. The ACS and HMIS data also in themselves contain a rich set of information about homeless individuals. By examining the coverage and reliability of Census, ACS, and HMIS data, this paper lays the foundation for future work taking full advantage of these datasets to learn about the U.S. homeless population. This paper also provides valuable insight into the coverage of people experiencing homelessness in the Census and household surveys, some of the most fundamental sources of data on the U.S. population.====We begin with an aggregate comparison of unsheltered and sheltered homeless estimates in the Census and PIT. We find that the Census and PIT's unsheltered estimates are quite close to one another, providing encouraging but not definitive evidence of the estimates’ accuracy. Moreover, despite what appear at first to be major differences in sheltered homeless estimates, the Census and PIT in fact produce similar estimates once we account for straightforward definitional and weighting differences. Specifically, the PIT's sheltered homeless population estimate includes people in domestic violence shelters, those in voucher-funded hotel and motel rooms, and people in non-shelter facilities, whereas the Census and ACS classify these groups of people as belonging to other, non-homeless statuses. We also describe an aspect of the ACS's weighting methodology that inflates sheltered homeless population estimates by over 30 percent in each year to represent people not included in the survey's scope. Adjusting for straightforward definitional differences and correcting the ACS weighting brings the Census and ACS estimates much closer to the sheltered PIT estimate. The fact that these two sources produce similar estimates despite employing substantially different methods bolsters our confidence in both estimates, although we discuss potential sources of bias relative to the true homeless population that may net out in aggregate comparisons.====Our second set of analyses compare data sources at the person level. We link HMIS shelter use microdata from Los Angeles and Houston to the 2010 Census to learn more about both sources’ coverage and to assess the usefulness of Census microdata to study this population. Under stated assumptions and after accounting for likely errors in shelter exit date reporting in the HMIS data, we estimate that about 80–95 percent of people who were indicated as being in HMIS shelters on the date of the Census's homeless counting operation were counted in the Census, although only about 35–45 percent of them were included in the Census's sheltered homeless count, with the rest being counted as housed, unsheltered homeless, or in other types of group quarters facilities. We provide evidence that errors in shelter exit date tracking in HMIS are an important reason for these status discrepancies. We also show that many HMIS facilities, particularly transitional shelters where homeless individuals can reside for up to two years, appear to have been often classified as housing units or other types of group quarters rather than homeless shelters by the Census. Finally, we note that many people may have responded to the Census while housed before entering a shelter or after exiting it during the long window of potential Census response, which ran from mid-March to well into May 2010.====Unexpectedly, our microdata comparisons reveal extensive double-counting of homeless individuals in the 2010 Census. We estimate that 21–24 percent of the sheltered homeless, 45–56 percent of those counted in soup kitchens and while using food vans, and 29–35 percent of those at outdoor locations had at least one housed record in addition to their homeless record in the 2010 Census. We rule out widespread erroneous linkages and misclassification of housed people as homeless and provide evidence that double counting arises primarily when homeless individuals are included on the Census questionnaire of a household where they occasionally reside or where they resided within a few months of the Census's homeless counting operation.====Finally, we develop a new approach to estimating the size of the sheltered homeless population using linked Census and HMIS shelter microdata. This method draws on dual system estimation techniques used frequently in demography and in ecology and allows us to obtain a reliable estimate of the true population under certain assumptions. In brief, we take the share of people in HMIS shelters in Los Angeles and Houston on the Census date who were included in the Census's homeless counting operation as an estimate of the share of the true sheltered homeless population in the Census. We then scale up the Census estimate by the inverse of this share to adjust for under coverage and obtain an estimate of the true sheltered homeless population. This approach does not make assumptions about the completeness of the Census or PIT, but does rely on several assumptions, including the assumption that those counted and uncounted in the Census are equally likely to appear in the HMIS data, an assumption that is plausible but difficult to verify. Using these methods, we estimate the sheltered homeless population size in 2010 to be 367,000–382,000 people, or about 5–10 percent lower than the 2010 PIT estimate and about 27–32 percent larger than the Census count after straightforward definitional adjustments. These analyses suggest that about 93–97 percent of people who were in shelters on the Census date were included in the Census in some status. In addition to providing a new population estimate, this section serves as a blueprint for future researchers seeking to estimate the homeless population as additional data become available.====Our analyses produce several key insights into the size of the U.S. homeless population. We find that, despite what initially appear to be substantial differences between 2010 Census, ACS, and PIT estimates of the homeless population, these sources produce very similar estimates once we account for definitional and weighting differences. We evaluate these aggregate comparisons for the sheltered homeless population with our dual system approach. Taken together, these estimates suggest that on a given night there are about 400,000 people experiencing homelessness in shelters in the U.S. and about 200,000 people sleeping on the streets, with the latter number subject to greater uncertainty. At the same time, our results highlight the fact that there is considerable ambiguity about what types of facilities constitute homeless shelters and that population estimates are sensitive to how these ambiguities are resolved.====Beyond population estimates, this paper also advances our understanding of homeless individuals’ coverage in the Census. Our findings suggest that the Census was able to include more than 90 percent of sheltered homeless individuals, although oftentimes it classified them as housed or as residing in non-shelter group quarters facilities. At the same time, widespread instances of double counting of homeless individuals in the Census paint a picture of a highly mobile population that frequently transitions between housed and homeless living situations. These findings suggest that household surveys that rely on Census address lists may incorporate homeless individuals more often than previously thought. By establishing the broad coverage and reliability of the new data sources, this paper lays the foundation for pathbreaking future work using the Census, ACS, and HMIS datasets, including efforts to learn about this population's longitudinal patterns of income and safety net participation and the heightened mortality risk associated with homelessness.====This paper proceeds as follows.

The policy limited the priority for enrollment in a public elementary schools given to house owners in the school's district so that each housing property is given only one priority every five years; hence, informal acquisition of priorities through frequent resale of houses is limited. From the dataset of individual housing prices in Shanghai, we show that ","The benefits of public school availability, as well as those of other public services, are known to be capitalized to neighboring house prices. This trend is particularly evident in the countries and regions that utilize the school district systems, where the school availability is limited to the residents within the boundaries of the school district, the disparity in housing prices across the boundary is considered to represent a premium due to the quality of the school (Black, 1999; Bayer et al., 2007; Dahr and Ross, 2012). On the other hand, the degree of this premium depends not only on the quality of the schools, but also on various conditions like the quality of nearby private schools (Fack and Grenet, 2010) and charter schools (Andreyeva and Patrick, 2017; Zheng, 2022) and the probability of winning the lottery for school admission (Bonilla-Mejía et al., 2020).====Many recent studies also have analyzed capitalization effect of school district reform. Reback (2005) reported a decrease in the housing price premium for schools that accept students due to the introduction of the school choice policy, and Brunner et al. (2012) show that student acceptance not only reduces premiums but also alleviates sorting by income among districts. According to the regression discontinuity design of Schwartz et al. (2014), such school choice reduces the premium for school scores by about one-third. These are also verified in other countries. Machin and Salvanes (2016) report that liberalization of high school districts in Oslo reduces premiums by about 50%. In Beijing, Huang et al. (2020) report the relaxation of premiums through various school district reform programs, such as the introduction of lotteries and the consolidation of public schools.====However, the previous studies on school district systems have largely disregarded the presence of “loopholes” as an unavoidable aspect of the system, which has gathered major concern. While school district systems actually allow for exceptional and flexible treatment for the situation of families and children,==== it also enables parents to exploit enrollment right in popular schools by falsifying addresses (Noreisch, 2007a). While the recent severe competition for popular school districts exerts parents to use the loopholes in many countries and regions, like Berlin (Noreisch, 2007a), London (Butler and Hamnet, 2011), and Amsterdam (Boterman, 2022), resulting in huge financial and phycological burden for families, including long commuting time==== and uncertainty of school admission (Noreisch, 2007a,b; Butler and Hamnett, 2011). Nevertheless, such informal school choice is hardly captured by a comprehensive dataset, and most studies on loopholes are limited to fact-finding surveys, which leads to a scarcity of quantitative research to show the significance of that problem within the entire school district system and the housing market.====This is the first quantitative research to investigate the significance of the impact of school district loopholes on house prices, which is made possible by examining the effects of a policy restricting loopholes conducted in Shanghai, China. Even though the impact of the introduction of school choice and district liberalization has been investigated by previous studies, this investigation into the tightening of school admission, which is against the global trend, makes a unique contribution to the existing literature. In China, the school admission system gives households living in their own houses in the school district the highest priority for elementary and junior high school admission, which causes the rise in house prices especially in popular school districts with highly performing schools (Chan et al., 2020). However, the system had a loophole to help people save on expensive housing cost by reselling houses as soon as they entered the school, and actually live in nearby but outside areas (Wu, 2013); hence, the loophole will enable informal school choices across school district boundary. To address such loophole through the “early reselling”, several wards of Shanghai have introduced a new rule since 2014 that allows each house only one admission right every five years. Using a large-scale dataset of housing transactions in Shanghai, we conducted a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis that uses this policy implementation as a treatment effect. We are particularly interested in how the treatment effects of these policies affect popular school districts and closed surrounding area outside of those districts.====Our study makes three contributions to the literature. Firstly, we provide the first empirical study on the significance and magnitude of the effect of school district loopholes on the housing market, which reports an 8% price increase in top-tire school districts within the wards that have introduced the policy, resulting in a roughly 40% increase in district premium. The result shows that the effect of loopholes is similar to those of school districts liberalization or school choice programs, reported by former studies in other countries both qualitatively and quantitatively. We suppose that the impact of the informal school choice through the loophole is as significant as those provided by the formal policy reforms.====Secondly, our analysis reveals that the loophole regulations have a negative impact on housing prices in areas outside the school district boundaries, particularly significant in the areas nearby the boundaries. Although several existing studies, such as Huang et al. (2020) and Zheng (2022), have used samples near school district boundaries as reference groups to rigorously measure the impact of institutional reforms with spatial regression discontinuity design, they have not directly focused on the effects on the neighboring areas. These neighborhood areas, known in China as “baby sitting communities,” have provided housing to families using loophole by early resale. Households using loophole are also known to live in neighboring districts in many other countries. The negative effect appears strongly on the closed neighboring districts, indicating that the spillover of housing demand from popular school districts by the loopholes is dependent on the proximity to the school district, due to the presence of transportation costs.====On the other hand, loophole regulations may be considered similar to land-use regulations, which is known to extrude housing demand from the targeted areas to neighbor districts to increase their housing prices (Ihlanfeldt, 2007; Gyourko and Molloy, 2015). However, in contrast to the fact on land use regulation, the negative effects of the loophole regulation on the neighbor areas dominated the effects of the extruded demand. This spatial bias of capitalized benefit is that policymakers must keep in mind.====Thirdly, we investigate time-varying effects of the policy, which is specially significant immediately after implementation while persistent throughout our data period. This result shows how the sudden introduction of policies causes a local supply-demand imbalance in the short-term, which is gradually absorbed by the entire Shanghai housing market. Although there is not enough evidence to reveal a more detailed mechanism, combined with data on the number of home transactions in each ward, it is implied that speculative transaction were expelled from the wards restricting early reselling while increases those in the other wards.====The structure of this paper is as follows.

Return migrants increase the local labor supply, potentially hurting local workers. However, having been exposed to a more advanced U.S. economy, they may also carry human capital that benefits non-migrants. Using an instrument based on involuntary return migration, we find that, whereas workers who share returnees’ occupations experience a fall in wages, workers in other occupations see their wages rise. These effects are, however, transitory and restricted to the city-industry receiving the returnees. In contrast, returnees permanently alter a city’s long-run industrial composition, by raising employment levels in the local industries that hire them.","The migration flows between the U.S. and Mexico have received ample attention in academic and public debates. These debates have mostly focused on whether migration from Mexico to the U.S. helps or hurts U.S. workers, and, to a lesser extent, on whether or not this migration acts as a brain-drain on the Mexican economy. However, migration is no one-way street. In the first decade of the 21st century, an average of 200,000 Mexicans a year left the U.S. to return home. This return migration and its economic consequences are often missing from the public and academic debates of U.S.-Mexico migration. As a consequence, we know relatively little about how the return of Mexican emigrées affects the Mexican economy. On the one hand, these returnees tend to have low levels of formal education, even relative to the wider Mexican population. Their return may therefore simply expand the supply of low-skill labor and depress wages of non-migrants with similarly low skill levels. On the other hand, having worked in the U.S. may have provided the returnees with new skills and knowledge of advanced organizational and technological processes. In that case, non-migrants could benefit from the human capital that returnees built up while they were in the U.S. We study the balance of these effects, by identifying the aggregate causal impact of return migration on wage and employment growth in Mexican cities. To do so, we use an identification strategy that exploits information on Mexican immigrants who were deported by U.S. authorities and therefore left the U.S. involuntarily.====Much of the debate about whether immigrants help or hurt locals revolves around the question of whether these immigrants are substitutes or complements to local workers (Dustmann et al., 2016). If immigrants have the same skills as locals, negative substitution effects will dominate. If immigrants have different skills than locals, locals will see their wages and employment opportunities increase. Both effects essentially operate through an increase in the local supply of skills. Most existing literature therefore categorizes locals and immigrants based on their levels and, sometimes, quality (see, for instance, Ottaviano and Peri, 2012) of education or occupational work experience (Borjas, 2003). However, if returnees help local employers upgrade their production technologies, these skill-based groupings may conceal the positive productivity effects that affect different skill groups in the same firm. In particular, returnees’ past exposure to advanced production processes or organizational routines in the U.S. may benefit the productive unit in which the returnee finds employment in Mexico. To see if we can identify such positive effects, we proxy these productive units by city-industry cells, expanding the standard, occupation or skill-based, worker typology that is used in most migration studies with an industry dimension.====We argue that, if returnees carry industry-specific human capital, both wages and demand for labor in the industry in Mexico will adjust, with short- and long-term effects on local workers. The short-term effects manifest themselves in wage disparities that provide incentives for workers to move between industries or between cities. In the long run, however, the wage disparities will dissipate, but the shifts in employment they have set in motion will be permanent, altering a city’s long-run industry mix (Dustmann and Glitz, 2015).====One challenge in testing this hypothesis is that migration decisions are endogenous to economic circumstances at the destination. We therefore construct an instrument that focuses on return migrants that did not ==== to return to Mexico. In particular, the instrument is based on a sample of returnees that were deported from the U.S. To avoid endogeneity in the choice of destination, we furthermore cross returnees’ US industry and occupation of work with their Mexican place of birth to predict exogenous return-migration flows by city-industry-occupation cell in Mexico.====Another concern is that regions that receive no immigrants do not necessarily represent adequate counterfactual development paths for those that do: regions that have been relatively unexposed to international migration may absorb second-round internal migration flows, consisting of locals who leave more exposed regions (Borjas, Freeman, Katz, et al., 1996, Card, 2001). Such internal mobility disperses the effects of immigration across worker types and locations, diluting them to such an extent that they become hard to measure. To – at least partially – address such concerns, we study how effects of migration change over time. The rationale for this is that the problem of improper spatial counterfactuals is most severe when determining long-run effects. After all, for mobility of workers to restore a local labor market’s equilibrium, at least in the short run some wage differences need to arise that workers can exploit.====Our empirical analysis corroborates this. Wages of non-migrants do respond to an influx of return migrants. However, these effects are transitory: they peak after two to three years and then fade out within five years.==== The full range of effects is only visible when we divide workers into city-industry-occupation cells. When non-migrants encounter returnees in their city-industry in their own occupations, they experience wage decreases. In contrast, when returnees enter other occupations in the city-industry, non-migrants experience wage increases. However, these latter effects remain hidden when we study local wages in city-occupation cells instead of city-industry-occupation cells.====Whereas the wage effects of return migration are temporary, employment effects are permanent. Local industries that receive return migrants grow for about three years, after which their employment more or less plateaus. Because this growth excludes the returnees’ own jobs, the permanent employment effect means that return migrants create new jobs. In combination with the positive wage effects, this hints at the possibility that return migration helps diffuse valuable industry-specific know-how from the U.S. to Mexico.====These findings are robust to a range of variations in how we quantify the intensity of return migration, to different sample definitions, to the inclusion of pre-trends, and when we run our analysis on a different, independent, dataset. Furthermore, to gauge whether a local economy’s unobserved attractiveness could bias our estimates, we use information on workers who relocate within Mexico. When added as a covariate to control for a city-industry’s attractiveness, we find virtually no changes in the estimated effects of return migration. When we use these internal migration flows as a placebo treatment, we fail to find any statistically significant association with the instrument, indicating that involuntary returns are not likely to be correlated with pre-existing economic conditions at destination.====Our study therewith provides new insights into a hitherto relatively neglected segment of one of the most visible migration corridors in the world: the return migration from the U.S. to Mexico. It is similar in spirit to a working paper by Conover et al. (2018) that analyzes the effect of a recent fall in net outmigration to the U.S. on local Mexican labor markets, but instead focuses directly on the impact of returnees. Moreover, understanding how Mexican returnees affect the local economies where they settle back complements a vast literature on migration from Mexico to the U.S. (e.g., Chiquiar, Hanson, 2005, Borjas, Katz, 2007, Card, Lewis, 2007, Peri, 2012, Ambrosini, Peri, 2012, Reinhold, Thom, 2013, Kaestner, Malamud, 2014, Angelucci, 2015, Clemens, Lewis, Postel, 2018, Feigenberg, 2020).====Beyond analyzing the specific U.S.-Mexico corridor, our study adds to the literature on the economics of migration. Historically, this literature has mostly focused on the flow from poor to rich countries, either asking whether or not migrants displace local workers in the recipient country (e.g., Borjas, 2003, Ottaviano, Peri, 2012) or how the potential brain drain undermines the development of the sending economy (Beine et al., 2008). More recently, scholars have stressed the potential for positive effects on the recipient country due to complementarities between locals and migrants or due to knowledge spillovers from highly skilled immigrants (Kerr, Lincoln, 2010, Moser, Voena, Waldinger, 2014, Hornung, 2014, Akcigit, Grigsby, Nicholas, 2017, Bahar, Rapoport, 2018, Diodato, Morrison, Petralia, 2022). What this literature typically neglects, is that, although migration flows may be imbalanced, they do not just run in one direction (Saxenian, 2007). A substantial number of migrants eventually decides to return home. Such return migration is qualitatively different from regular migration. First, return migrants face no language or cultural barriers in their destination. Second, the traditional understanding of high-skill migration poorly captures the knowledge about organizational and technological practices that returnees acquire in advanced host economies. In line with this, a small number of closely related papers has shown that return migrants can be an important vector for knowledge transfer from technological advanced to lagging economies (Choudhury, 2015, Hausmann, Nedelkoska, 2018, Bahar, Özgüzel, Hauptmann, Rapoport, 2019). Here, we assess the evidence in support of such effects in the context of U.S.-Mexico migration, focusing on industry-specific human capital.====Finally, it is important to note that our study only offers a partial analysis of the consequences of return migration from the U.S. to Mexico, leaving out important aspects for welfare considerations. First, we do not study the earnings losses of the returnees themselves. Based on data from IPUMS USA (Ruggles et al., 2019), Mexican workers in the U.S. earn substantially – by a factor of two in real terms and of four in nominal terms – higher wages than workers in Mexico. Given that most return migrants do not return voluntarily, this difference in wages will represent a large loss in utility. Second, Mexican migrants in the U.S. send large remittances to their families back home. In 2015, these remittances amounted to over 2% of Mexico’s GDP (25B USD; The World Bank, 2016), or about 2000 USD per Mexican migrant. The income losses of Mexican returnees are therefore also felt by their families in Mexico, where they are further amplified by multiplier effects.",The impact of return migration on employment and wages in Mexican cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119023000268,2 May 2023,2023,Research Article,6.0

This paper studies white flight from Asian arrivals in high-socioeconomic-status suburban Californian school districts from 2000–2016 using initial ==== and national immigrant flows to instrument for entry. We find that, as Asian students arrive, white student enrollment declines in these higher-income suburbs. These patterns cannot be fully explained by racial animus, housing prices, or correlations with Black/Hispanic arrivals. Parental fears of academic competition may play a role.","Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, nearly doubling from a population of 12 million in 2000 to 22 million in 2019 (Budiman and Ruiz, 2021). Yet, we know very little about how Asian arrivals affect cities, towns, neighborhoods and school districts within US metropolitan areas. Areas may undergo “white flight” from Asian arrivals, as has been documented for previous waves of Black and Hispanic in-migration. Alternatively, Asian arrivals may be an anchor that attracts new population.====Why might patterns of attraction or flight from Asian arrivals be different than for other minority groups? On one hand, Asian Americans are more educated than other racial groups: 54% of Asian Americans ages 25 and up hold at least a Bachelor's degree, compared to 33% of the US population. As a result, Asian American students are widely considered to be a “model minority” who “possess an inherent cultural orientation and work ethic that other non-Whites supposedly lack,” a factor that could attract white families to areas with high Asian populations (Chou and Feagin, 2010; Jiménez and Horowitz, 2013). On the other hand, growing sociological evidence points to stereotypes about Asian families that might prompt white flight – including the notorious idea of an “Asian Tiger mother” (Chua, 2011). In particular, some white parents worry that their own children will suffer from competition in schools with high Asian enrollment or that the curriculum will emphasize academics at the expense of sports or other priorities (Louie, 2004; Lee and Zhou, 2015; Lung-Amam, 2017; Warikoo, 2022).====Concerns about competition with Asian students may be particularly acute in high-income or high-socioeconomic-status (SES) suburban school districts. Recent journalistic accounts of regions like suburban New Jersey or the Bay Area highlight these anxieties. Hwang (2005) reports that: “Many White parents say they're leaving because the schools are too academically driven and too narrowly invested in subjects such as math and science at the expense of liberal arts and extracurriculars like sports and other personal interests […]. The […] schools, put another way that parents rarely articulate so bluntly, are too Asian.”====This paper offers the first empirical analysis of white flight from Asian arrivals in US metropolitan areas. We focus on high-SES suburban school districts and use enrollment data from the state of California between 2000 and 2016. California offers a particularly useful setting because it is home to one third of the Asian American population in the US, and Asians represent 15% of the state population.====We begin by establishing the correlation in our sample of high-SES suburban districts between Asian entry and white departures within districts over time. We find that the arrival of one Asian student into a high-SES district is associated with 0.6 white departures. Of course, Asian entry into a school district is not random. Asian immigrants may choose to settle in districts that white households are already leaving, if these departures prompt housing prices to fall. In this case, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates would be ==== finding white flight. Alternatively, Asian households may be attracted to the same improvements in local amenities that pull white families to a school district (e.g., a new principal or school building). In this case, OLS estimates will be ==== from finding white flight.====We address these concerns by instrumenting for Asian arrivals using a shift-share instrument, as adapted to the immigration setting by Card (2001). Our instrument makes use of the fact that Asian immigrants from particular countries- or regions-of-origin – South Asia, China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan – clustered in certain towns or neighborhoods in California's metropolitan areas in the baseline year (2000). Two of these groups (South Asians and Chinese) subsequently had high inflows, two had lower inflows (Koreans and Japanese) and two were in-between. Districts with a higher initial percentage of high-inflow groups received more Asian immigrants over the subsequent years, both overall and after controlling for initial Asian share.====We continue to find evidence of white flight when instrumenting for Asian arrivals: the enrollment of one Asian student leads to 1.5 white departures on average. The fact that white flight is larger with instrumental variable (IV) estimates than with OLS suggests that OLS estimates are biased away from white flight due to unobserved amenities that attract both white and Asian households.====One key assumption underlying our instrument is that unobserved factors associated with the initial distribution of Asian immigrants across districts are uncorrelated with other factors – like neighborhood or school quality – that may determine white location choice in subsequent years. We test this assumption in three ways. First, we control for initial Asian share interacted with year fixed effects (Borusyak et al., 2022). In this case, we compare two districts with similar Asian density that differ only in the composition ==== their Asian population. Second, we identify a series of other baseline school district characteristics that are correlated with initial Asian share using a LASSO model, and then control for interactions between these characteristics and year fixed effects (as suggested by Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. 2020). Third, we select ==== available Census variables related to initial age distribution and initial household income to use as controls, rather than relying on the specific variables selected by LASSO. Our results are robust to allowing differential trends in enrollment across school districts according to each of these baseline attributes.====The second part of the paper then considers mechanisms that could explain the differential response to Asian arrival across high-SES suburban school districts. We start by ruling out three possible mechanisms: a correlated rise in black or Hispanic students, direct antipathy or distaste for Asian classmates, or housing market dynamics. First, we do not find any empirical association between Asian arrivals and black/Hispanic entry to the district. Second, survey data shows that white respondents with higher education levels exhibit ==== aversion toward Asian Americans, a pattern that could not explain the concentration of white flight in high-SES districts. Third, as with any new population to an area, Asian arrivals may increase local housing prices. However, the pace of white flight from suburban areas – a departure rate of 1.5 to one – implies that white households are motivated by concerns beyond the housing market (Boustan, 2010).====We then turn to the most likely explanation for the balance of the observed white flight from Asian arrivals in high-SES suburban districts: concerns over academic competition in schools. We document that Asian arrivals lead to test score gains for the full student body in these high-SES districts, but do not boost most measures of test scores for white students. In other words, the learning of white students appears unaffected but the relative performance in the class for the average white student would fall with Asian entry, potentially raising parental concerns about academic competition. Finally, we document that white flight takes place primarily through white departures from the district overall, rather than from substitution from public schools to local charter or private schools.====Existing literature on preferences for high-performing peers is mixed. Some papers find that households have preferences for higher-quality peers (Black, 1999; Deming et al., 2014; Sacerdote, 2011; Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2020). However, in other contexts, parents seek to avoid districts where their children would not be ranked at the top of the class (Cullen et al., 2013; Bui et al., 2014; Antecol et al., 2016). A growing literature suggests that earning a higher rank, even in elementary school, predicts future educational and economic success (Elsner and Isphording, 2017; Denning et al., 2018; Murphy and Weinhardt, 2020). Concern about grading on a curve may have been particularly relevant in high-SES suburban districts in California, where being at the top of one's high-school class guaranteed admission into one of the Universities of California under the “top-percent policy,” which was in place between 2001 and 2011 (Bleemer, 2021).====Our work also relates to several past studies on white/native flight from minority entrants. Many papers have examined white/native flight from non-whites/immigrants as a whole without differentiating responses to a particular racial or ethnic group (Card, 2001; Betts and Fairlie, 2003; Crowder and South, 2008; Crowder et al., 2011; Saiz and Wachter, 2011; Sá, 2015; Farre et al., 2018). Other papers focus on Hispanics (Cascio and Lewis, 2012; Caetano and Maheshri, 2017), or on African American migrants from the South to the North (Boustan 2010, Shertzer and Walsh 2019; see also Card et al. 2008 and Blair, 2017 on neighborhood tipping points). The estimates of white/native flight from the most closely related studies range from 1.4 to 2.7 white departures for each minority arrival. Our estimate of white flight from Asian arrivals falls on the low end of this range. Despite similar out-migration responses from various minority groups, we point here to different mechanisms, focusing on fear of academic competition. We also contribute to the small literature in economics on Asian Americans more broadly, most of which has focused on labor market performance (Chiswick, 1983; Hirschman and Wong, 1986; Suzuki, 1989; Sue and Okazaki, 1990, 2002; Hilger, 2017).",JUE Insight: White flight from Asian immigration: Evidence from California Public Schools,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119023000104,Available online 24 March 2023,2023,Research Article,7.0

Black commuters spent 49 more minutes commuting per week in 1980 than White commuters; this difference declined to 22 minutes per week in 2019. Two factors account for the majority of the difference: Black workers are more likely to commute by transit, and Black workers make up a larger share of the population in cities with long average commutes. Increases in car commuting by Black workers account for nearly one quarter of the decline in the racialized difference in commute times between 1980 and 2019. Today, commute times have mostly converged (conditional on observables) for car commuters in small- and mid-sized cities. In contrast, differential job access today drives persistent differences of commute times, particularly in large, congested, and expensive cities.","In 1955, Rosa Parks and five other Black women physically desegregated buses in Montgomery, AL when they refused to give up their seats to White passengers. Parks’s arrest sparked action in the local Black community, bringing local leaders together to form the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and lead a boycott of the buses until a more just solution was achieved.==== The year-long boycott involved many Black bus commuters: only 36% of commuters in the most segregated Black census tracts of central Montgomery commuted by car in the 1960 Census.==== MIA organizers faced many challenges coordinating carpooling services for the boycotters. Montgomery was very segregated, with Black residents heavily concentrated in neighborhoods away from the mostly White neighborhoods that were closer to the jobs in the city center. Black women in particular were likely to work in domestic service, which entailed commuting to White households scattered throughout the segregated city. Meanwhile, the police sought to intimidate carpool drivers and boycott leaders by pursuing early versions of “driving while Black” policing strategies (Jefferson-Jones, 2020). During a speech to the boycotters, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that Black commuters “have been inflicted with the paralysis of crippling fears on buses” and that “[this] problem has existed over endless years.”====The challenges faced by the MIA highlight how home location, work location, and the means of getting between the two collectively shape the time a worker spends commuting each day. Kain (1968) observed that the segregation of Black workers into certain center-city neighborhoods, job suburbanization, and lower rates of car ownership generated worse employment outcomes for Black households via increased ==== between home and work locations. Since then, each factor has evolved considerably. Residential segregation has declined after peaking in 1970, with some Black families now having access to a wider array of neighborhoods (Blair, 2017, Sander, Kucheva, Zasloff, 2018). Occupational segregation has likewise declined with Black workers having greater opportunities in a wider array of occupations and industries, though employment suburbanization has also continued (see, e.g., Bahn and Cumming, 2020). Today, 85% of Black workers now commute by car, a far cry from the transit and walking dependence common among Black commuters in 1950s Montgomery. Given these substantial improvements, how has commuting evolved for Black workers, and are commuting outcomes in American cities equitable by race?====The short answer is no. While the ==== in commute times has declined from 49 minutes per week in 1980, Black commuters today still spend 22 more minutes per week commuting than White commuters.==== In this paper, we investigate the factors behind this partial convergence and examine the mechanisms operating on individual commuters, neighborhoods, and cities that collectively obligate Black commuters into spending more time commuting.====We quantify the racialized difference in commute times conditional on working and decompose what portion of its evolution worked through channels observable in our data.==== Two factors explain more than half of the aggregate difference in commute times: Black workers are more likely to live in cities with longer average commutes and to commute by transit. Black workers also hold demographic and job characteristics associated with shorter commutes; these differences partly offset the other factors and lower the racialized difference by 3% in 1980 and by 22% today. Income does not explain this difference (in fact, it is ==== correlated with commute time). While the racialized difference in commute times is larger among those with low incomes and among transit users, it persists even for those with high incomes and who commute by car.====Of the total decline in the racialized difference in commute times from 1980 to 2019, we attribute 22% to changes in travel mode. Car usage increased for all commuters, with mode shares partially converging from 88% of White commuters and 76% of Black commuters in 1980 to 92% and 85%, respectively, by 2019. Commute times of White drivers increased more than those of Black drivers, amplifying the effect of mode on overall convergence in commute times. A further 13% of the convergence was attributable to changes in industry, occupation, and income: Black workers hold employment characteristics that are associated with relatively short commutes in general. Intriguingly, demographics and commuting zone (CZ) of residence play almost no role in the decline. The remainder of the overall decline (63%) flows through other channels.====We investigate several dimensions of heterogeneity to identify channels that could explain racialized difference in commuting. First, we conduct a bounding exercise and show that racialized difference is not generated by differential selection into the labor market.==== Next, we ask whether driving or high incomes eliminate the difference. While convergence in commute times has been greater among car commuters, it remains incomplete for drivers and for high earners. Among transit users, there has been no net convergence in commute times since 1980. Racialized difference in commuting is also present throughout the house price distribution; Black workers are not taking longer commutes as compensation for more affordable housing. Instead, spatial differences in home and workplace appear key. We incorporate within-CZ residential and workplace geographies available since 2000. Though coarse, residential and (especially) place-of-work PUMAs account for some racialized difference, especially in large cities.====We then quantify the variation in racialized difference across cities, estimating the ==== (RRD)—the average commute time difference that does not arise through observable channels—for each city and decade. The RRD has declined since 1980 in most cities; among cities with fewer than 500,000 employed workers, the average RRD today is near zero. The RRD is strongly correlated with city population, suggesting that a large population is now necessary (but not sufficient) for a city to generate a racialized difference in commute times.====We develop several city-level measures of job accessibility and relate them to RRD. We construct time-varying measures of local labor market access for the White and Black populations and aggregate these to measure city-by-racialized-group market access from ZIP-code level data on residential and workplace locations. In the largest cities, relative market access of Black residents deteriorated over our study period, with almost no change, on average, across other large and medium-sized cities. Differential market access thus undercut the convergence in commute times for Black and White workers. Other trends worked in the opposite direction: notably, declines in statistical segregation are associated with smaller values of RRD and account for a sizeable share of the total decline in RRD. Similarly, changes in inputs to travel speed—freeway construction, declining transit use, and indicators of faster travel speeds—are likewise associated with a declining RRD. Lastly, high housing price growth is a driver of persistent positive RRD: in expensive cities, access to job-rich areas is rationed by housing markets.====Racialized commuting outcomes were a pervasive feature of U.S. geography 40 years ago, present across much of the country regardless of city size or travel mode. The dramatic decline since 1980 belies nuanced forces that are increasingly city specific: for car commuters in small- and mid-sized cities, there has been almost complete convergence, conditional on observed characteristics. Today, the racialized difference in commute times arises primarily in very large cities with unequal job access, and distances too long (or congestion too intense) for a car to offer a short commute. The reductions in residential and employment segregation need not fully translate into more equitable job access—as Kain (1992) observed, Black households often relocated to suburbs on the opposite side of the city from suburbanizing employment in cities like Dallas. The evolution of the racialized difference in commuting reflects both meaningful gains for many Black workers and durable barriers to convergence.====This paper offers several contributions to literatures within urban economics and inequality. First, we comprehensively quantify the Black-White difference in commute times for all U.S. CZs and describe its evolution over the last 40 years. While the consequences of spatial mismatch on racial differences in employment outcomes has been studied at length, there has been little recent attention on the complementary study of inequitable commuting outcomes.==== While commuting mode—and particularly automobile access—impacts spatial mismatch (e.g., Gautier and Zenou, 2010; Gobillon, Selod, Zenou, 2007, Ong, 2002, Ong, Miller, 2005, Raphael, Stoll, 2001; Taylor and Ong, 1995), differences in commuting time itself are also indicative of spatial patterns of adversity.==== In fact, a growing literature examines gendered differences in commuting times (e.g., Black et al., 2014; Gutierrez, 2018, Hu, 2021; Liu and Su, 2020). We therefore focus on differences in commuting time as an outcome, and consider home and work location, mode, and selection into the labor market as potential explanations for these differences.====To this end, we use decomposition methods from the literature on gender and race wage differences to explore individual and city-level explanations of the difference in commuting times (Chamberlain, DiNardo, Fortin, Lemieux). Like that literature, we account for the role that observable individual demographic and occupation characteristics play in explaining racialized or gendered difference. Blau and Kahn (2017) find that individual characteristics explain very little of the gender wage gap in more recent years, and Altonji and Blank (1999), in a summary of the racial wage gap literature, note that the convergence of individual characteristics over time contributes to the decrease in the gap. The unexplained portion of the gap is traditionally interpreted as a measure of discrimination; however, it may also account for unmeasured productivity or compensating differentials. Our focus on the production of racialized difference in commuting follows calls for understanding the structural bases of racialized material difference (Darity Jr et al., 2015).====We hypothesize that spatial stratification within cities provides a basis for racialized commuting differences to arise. Existing work on neighborhood sorting contextualizes commuting differences, arguing that transportation rather than housing prices dictates urban patterns of income sorting (Glaeser, Kahn, Rappaport, 2008, LeRoy, Sonstelie, 1983). To this point, Aliprantis et al. (2019) observe that in cities without high-income Black neighborhoods, high-income Black households locate in Black neighborhoods with socioeconomic status similar to low-income White neighborhoods. In large cities with large Black populations and high-income Black neighborhoods, this result does not hold. Race—through possible channels of psychological costs and benefits, White flight, and racial discrimination—rather than financial constraints (wealth, housing prices) is driving income and racial neighborhood sorting.====Our use of commuter market access terms (e.g., Ahlfeldt et al., 2015) to measure the evolution of differential job access by race furthers this conclusion. We complement a growing literature on Black suburbanization and neighborhood change as it relates to the spatial organization of Black and White households within cities (Card, Mas, Rothstein, 2008, Blair, 2017, Wiese, 2005, Zax, 1990) and the related literature on sorting in schools (e.g., Caetano and Maheshri, 2017). Two recent papers are particularly relevant. Bartik and Mast (2021) document some convergence in the neighborhood income levels and poverty rates experienced by White and Black households, a change coming largely from the migration of some Black households to suburban neighborhoods (rather than rising incomes in mostly Black central-city neighborhoods). Indeed, about one-third of African Americans lived in the suburbs before 1980; by 2000, nearly two-thirds did (Wiese, 2005). Relatedly, Miller (2018) determines that job suburbanization has decreased Black employment, showing that Black workers are less likely to work in jobs further from city centers even among relocating firms. In addition to these disemployment effects, our results indicate that racialized differences in mode use and the spatial relationship between work and home form another nexus of inequality: commuting.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe our data, showcase descriptive statistics that motivate our analysis, and develop our methodology. Section 4 reports decomposition results and examines heterogeneity. Section 5 investigates city-level determinants of racialized difference.","The Problem Has Existed over Endless Years: Racialized Difference in Commuting, 1980–2019",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119023000116,Available online 22 March 2023,2023,Research Article,8.0

The restrictive requirements generate a “jump” in the number of recipients at ages around 25. We use a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design to assess the impact of the French minimum income program (RSA) on users of accommodation and meal distribution services. We find that the RSA benefit reduces the homelessness rate by 20% among young adults aged 22 to 27. This result is driven by new RSA recipients who have started paying partial rent to third parties, and the probability of becoming a regular tenant increases after age 26. We simulate the effects of lowering the program’s minimum age eligibility on the probability of being homeless. Our findings suggest that in programs directed at homeless individuals, around 60% of expenditures are offset by savings in social assistance costs to the homeless.","Over the past 40 years, homelessness has surged as a social issue that demands the attention of public authorities in high-income countries like France. The standard approach to mitigating homelessness has been to provide emergency shelters, rapid rehousing programs, and transitional housing services (Burt et al., 2016). More recently, financial assistance has been added as a prevention strategy. However, despite an extensive literature on homelessness and its determinants, there is still scant empirical evidence on the impact of cash assistance programs on homelessness (O’Flaherty, 2019).====In this paper, we investigate the impact of the French guaranteed minimum income program on users of meal distribution and accommodation services. The RSA (Revenu de Solidarité Active) is a cash transfer program with no time limit that targets a broad group of low-income households that are able to work. It covers about 2 million households and acts as a last resort for those who are not eligible for other benefits. In 2012, program benefits could take two forms: basic RSA and Activity RSA. Basic RSA is a guaranteed minimum income program for households with no earned income, and Activity RSA is supplementary income for households with activity income but whose resources fall below a threshold.====A key identification challenge here is self-selection, since the probability of treatment may correlate with individuals’ unobserved characteristics. Another possible source of bias is the take-up rate (of a priori unknown direction and magnitude). Take-up may reduce the probability of being in the sample, since individuals who receive the benefit might stop using services targeting the very poor, select out of the scope of the survey, and not be observed. On the other hand, individuals may learn about the RSA program and its eligibility rules when they use meal or accommodation services. Lastly, take-up while being in the sample may be correlated with unobserved factors that would make individuals do better even in the absence of take up (e.g., social networks).====In an ideal setting, we would randomly assign program participation and then observe the resulting outcome differential between treatment and control groups. Our empirical strategy mimics this ideal by using a regression discontinuity design (RD). We exploit an age eligibility threshold to evaluate the program’s impact on homeless status, the number of meals taken at meal distribution centers, and use of shelters. In France, childless adults younger than 25 face hard-to-meet eligibility conditions to enroll in the minimum income program: in addition to the income means test, they must have worked at least two years over the last three (3,214 hours). This condition is especially restrictive, since this cohort faces the highest unemployment rate in France (25.3% in 2013) and was hit particularly hard by the economic crisis in the early 2010s. These eligibility requirements generate a “jump” in the number of recipients at age 25. By comparing the outcomes of individuals of similar age, but who barely meet or barely miss the age eligibility criterion, we can attribute differences to the RSA program (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008). To address potential attrition in our sample after age 25, we also employ a trimming procedure (Lee, 2009) for bounding treatment effects.====Homelessness is predominantly an urban issue. In the US, the vast majority of the 550,000 homeless are concentrated in large urban centers. Similarly, the most recent figures for France estimate that less than 10% of the nearly 150,000 homeless people live in rural areas (Yaouancq et al., 2013). Homelessness inflicts a substantial financial burden on governments. Estimates show that the average cost per homeless person per year is US$13,661 in the US and € 16,563 in France. In the US, federal funding for local organizations to combat homelessness more than doubled over the last decade, reaching US$6.1 billion annually (USICH, 2018). In France, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than € 450 million of additional credits for assistance that targets the homeless (CAE, 2020). The private costs of homelessness are also significant. Compared with the general population, the homeless display higher mortality rates, more exposure to violence, and a higher incidence of psychological disorders (Hodgson, Shelton, van den Bree, Los, 2013, Morton, Dworsky, Matjasko, Curry, Schlueter, Chávez, Farrell, 2018). Youth homelessness is especially worrying because of its damaging long-term effects (Cobb-Clark and Zhu, 2017).====We find that the RSA benefit reduces the homelessness rate by 20% among young adults aged 22 to 27 in cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants. We test our models on a subsample of respondents using a face-to-face interview, which yields substantially less ambiguity than self-administered questionnaires and allows us to control for psychological and background variables. The results are very similar to our findings using the full sample. Consistent with the assumption that free meals are an inferior good, we find a decline in the demand for (almost) free meals at food distribution centers. At the same time, respondents report an increase in the number of meals taken at home and a decrease in shelter entries.====Our results conform to a small but growing empirical literature that finds that cash assistance is associated with a reduction in homelessness. Evans et al. (2016) find that individuals who received temporary funding were 76% less likely to enter a shelter. The New Leaf project in Vancouver — a RCT in which participants received a lump sum transfer — reduced days homeless by 35%. In these programs, however, the cash participants received was unexpected. In contrast, we study the effects of a cash transfer that can be anticipated. For the US, Parolin (2021) finds that greater access to cash transfers from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is associated with declines in family homelessness. In addition to being temporary, the TANF program primarily targets single-mother families, whereas the RSA is a permanent program that covers a much broader range of poor households. Previous studies show that long-term programs are more effective in reducing homelessness. Also in the US, Gubits et al. (2018), using data from the Family Options Study, find that access to short-term rent subsidies had almost no effect on helping homeless families achieve stable housing, whereas a permanent subsidy nearly halved episodes of homelessness.====Further examination helps us identify the mechanisms that drive our results. Individuals in our sample are either hosted for free, pay a partial rent, or are regular tenants. Our estimates suggest that receiving the RSA increases the probability of joining a partial-rent scheme for new RSA beneficiaries, while the effect on the probability of becoming a regular tenant kicks in only after age 26. We also find that crossing the age threshold renders individuals more likely to receive a rent subsidy and meet regularly with a caseworker.====We perform a sensitivity analysis to test how changes in the definition of homelessness may impact our results. We find that the RSA benefit also reduces the probability of sleeping rough and that recidivism, measured by the number of shelter entries, declines significantly around age 26–27. Finally, we simulate the effects of extending the benefit to under-25s on the same terms that apply to the 25-year-olds who are now eligible. Our findings suggest that in programs directed at homeless individuals in our sample, a substantial share of the costs (60%) would be offset by corresponding savings from the reduction in Point-in-Time (PiT) homelessness.====Our paper’s contribution to the literature is threefold. This is the first paper, to our knowledge, to empirically assess the effects of a guaranteed minimum income program on homelessness. Second, since income from the RSA program is not unexpected income nor a lump-sum cash grant, we study a question that is highly relevant for the implementation of cash transfer policies to reduce homelessness. Lastly, the cohort we focus on is of great relevance. The young adult cohort is overrepresented among the 5% most costly homeless individuals in France and the US (Étude Nationale, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority).====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the RSA program. Section 3 presents and explains the data. We describe the methodology and RD results in Section 4, and conduct robustness checks in Section 5.

The lingering impact likely reflects the global transmission of the pandemic’s effects through the ==== and trade channels.,"In China, information on unemployment is derived from the number of individuals who registered with unemployment benefit agencies prior to 2018 and is supplemented by household surveys for the years afterward.==== Measuring unemployment accurately is particularly challenging in the Chinese context due to the large fraction of the population who do not have local household registrations (====) and hence are excluded from the unemployment surveys. In addition, reporting and aggregation errors, as well as potential data manipulations, have also been documented (====, ====, ====). China’s official national unemployment rate has varied within a tight range of 3.1%–4.3% over the past two decades, leading to questions about its reliability (====), especially in the face of the rapid and unprecedented social and economic changes brought about by the pandemic.====This study leverages high-frequency and high-resolution mobile phone usage data in Guangdong, the most populous province in China, with a GDP larger than that of all but the top 12 countries in the world. Our primary data source consists of location tracking information for one million randomly selected users and mobile phone records for 71 million users from January 2018 to September 2020. We examine the pandemic’s labor market impacts for various demographic groups and across cities with different industrial structures by employing the standard difference-in-differences (DID) framework. We use observations from the year 2020 as the treatment group and those from the year 2019 as the control group. The key identification assumption is that the labor market outcomes would have tracked between the two groups in the absence of the pandemic and hence that the observed differences can be attributed to the pandemic rather than to time-varying unobservables. Results from ==== provide strong support for the assumption of common trends between the two groups prior to the event date.====We leverage two unique features of our data to estimate pandemic labor market impacts: a) the information on the number of individuals who stopped commuting to work for an extended period of time (noncommuters) as a measure of unemployment, and b) the information on the number of unique individuals who contacted unemployment benefit agencies via the designated hotline (12333) as a measure of unemployment benefit claims. We first validate these two measures and then provide several pieces of evidence to show that our unemployment impact is unlikely to be driven by a shift to work-from-home (WFH), a key confounder in interpreting the results based on commuting patterns. We also conduct a host of robustness checks and find that our results are robust to alternative variable definitions, data selection and model specifications.====Several key findings emerge from our analysis. First, the pandemic increased unemployment in Guangdong by 72% and unemployment benefit claims by 57% after the full reopening relative to those during the same period (from May to September) in 2019. The effect does not show a diminishing trend within the five-month window before September 2020, the end of our data period. The sharp rise in unemployment is much higher than that reported in the government statistics, which registered an increase of 13.3% in Guangdong province’s unemployment rate (from 2.26 percentage points in January–March to 2.56 percentage points in July–September) during the same period.====, health care, or education industries. In addition, the impact was more pronounced in cities that rely heavily on export, reflecting the global nature of the shock in an interconnected world economy. Industry composition accounts for 39% of the heterogeneity in the pandemic’s unemployment impact across cities, while trade exposure contributes 29% of the heterogeneity.====Last, our results reveal the severity and uneven character of the pandemic’s labor market consequences, which speak to the importance of conducting analysis at granular levels. In addition, these results illustrate the ripple effect of the pandemic across cities within the country and across countries worldwide through the ==== and trade channels. A city’s (or country’s) industry composition, its exposure to trade, and the nature of the supply chain are crucial determinants of the pandemic’s effect on its economy. Our measures help us understand the pandemic’s labor market impact at a granular level and can inform targeted policies to help the most severely affected groups and regions.====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Our study illustrates how this type of data can also be used to understand the labor market impact of the pandemic in near real time.====Second, our study contributes to the burgeoning literature on the impacts of the pandemic. The literature is now too large to discuss in detail, but our paper is closely related to studies that use mobile phone data to measure mobility and social distancing after the onset of the pandemic (====, ====) and that focus on the labor market impacts of the pandemic (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Compared to the samples in these studies, our mobile phone data benefit from a large sample size and fine resolution on both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and our study is the only one on China.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: ==== discusses the context of the study and provides descriptive evidence. ==== lays out the empirical framework. ==== and ==== present the event-study and regression results, and ==== concludes.",The COVID-19 pandemic and unemployment: Evidence from mobile phone data from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119023000128,7 March 2023,2023,Research Article,10.0

Using a two-way ==== design, I find BWCs are associated with a 29% reduction in use-of-force complaints, driven by white officer-black civilian complaints. Additionally, I find a 34% reduction in officers reporting striking civilians and a large though less significant reduction in officer firearm usage, potential mechanisms for the reduction in complaints. Importantly, I find no change in officer injury or force from civilians. However, I find evidence of de-policing as officers make fewer drug-related arrests following BWC adoption.","Body-worn cameras (BWCs) have become an integral part of a police officer’s uniform. In fact, over 80% of US police departments with more than 1,000 officers have deployed BWCs (Hyland, 2018). These devices can assist both officers and civilians by recording incidents where officers interact with their community. These recordings create an observable log of events that a third party can view, removing hearsay between civilians and officers. BWCs even have had widespread usage beyond police officers with adoption among school security guards, prison guards, and the secret service (Nyczepir, 2021). However, due to the rapid adoption of this new technology, many public offices were found spending millions of dollars adopting BWCs before researchers were able to conduct rigorous analysis on their effect.====BWCs primarily act as a monitoring device that helps to support or exonerate officers from accusations of misconduct. This is especially important since officers operate with a high level of impunity making it difficult for complaints to be made against them without substantial evidence. This is illustrated by the fact that in Chicago, 97% of complaints against the police do not result in any disciplinary action (CPDP, 2021). However, equipping officers with BWCs can also lead to behavioral changes since both officers and civilians now know their actions are recorded potentially preventing violent incidents from occurring.====However, the net effect of monitoring police and civilian actions using BWCs is ==== unclear. BWCs can lead to reduction in force on the intensive margin, where officers use a lesser amount of force for the same incidents (e.g. using a TASER instead of a firearm) for fear of disciplinary action. This reduction in force would reduce injuries to civilians but could inadvertently increase injury to officers, if force is used prevent officer injury. Choosing the correct level of force is a difficult decision that officers face on a daily basis, where using either too much or too little force can have negative consequences. Conversely, BWCs can increase the level of force if, prior to BWCs, officers were restraining themselves from using force even if force is warranted. Adopting BWCs provides protection to officers against disciplinary action for unfounded complaints. This form of moral hazard can justify force as retaliatory action. This is especially problematic since police departments often award officers with discretion on when to activate their BWC. This discretion can lead to a biased log of events due to selection of which events are recorded. Understanding which officers turn on their cameras and which do not, is a highly important question when evaluating the effectiveness of a BWC program and a question that has not been answered in the literature.====This paper explores the channels in which BWCs affect officer and civilian interactions using data from the Chicago Police Department (CPD), one of the largest police departments in the US. I use a two-way fixed effects design that leverages differences in the timing of BWC adoption across the city of Chicago. I look to answer several questions. First, I explore how BWCs affect use-of-force by officers using civilian-filed complaints as a proxy for excessive force. Next, I turn to officer-reported force data. This supplemental analysis from the officer perspective complements complaints data by allowing me to control for the fact that BWCs may increase the likelihood that a civilian will file a complaint. It additionally allows me to explore other outcomes, such as officer firearm usage, TASER usage, officer/civilian injuries, and civilian force actions. This data differs from previous work that focuses on less-frequent high-cost police actions such as police-involved homicides (Kim, 2021) and misconduct case filings (Bollman, 2021).====An additional worry that BWC critics have proposed is that BWCs could lead to police passivity. Officers equipped with BWCs may second guess involving themselves in interactions that have the potential to lead to external scrutiny, an action known as de-policing. As a result, we may see fewer arrests, fewer investigatory stops, and even potentially more crime. To explore this hypothesis, I also bring in officer arrest and crime reporting data. The combination of these three datasets provides me with a constellation of evidence on the effect of BWCs on officer and civilian actions.====I find that BWCs are associated with a reduction of 0.031 use-of-force complaints per district per day, a large 29% reduction from the pre-treatment mean. This effect is driven by a reduction in white officer-black civilian complaints. In an attempt to avoid conflating the reduction in complaints with a change in complaint filing behavior, I also study officer-reported force. I identify two possible mechanisms for the reduction in complaints within officer-reported actions. First, I find a reduction of 0.024 reports of officers striking a civilian per district per day, a 34% reduction from the pre-treatment mean. Second, I find a less significant but large reduction in firearm usage. While I find reduction in these two action categories, I find no significant reduction in total actions, suggesting that effort from officers are not reduced. Additionally, I find no significant difference in civilians resisting arrest or assaulting officers as well as no change in reported injuries to officers. Taken together, these results suggest that BWCs are an effective deterrence device against excessive use-of-force, importantly not at the expense of officer safety.====I additionally find a short-run increase in officer reports of crime that persist for one quarter that are not in response to a change in arrest behavior. This short-run change is likely due to an increase attentiveness by officers immediately following BWC’s adoption. The fact that this change is short-lived, explains some of the large and inconsistent findings of earlier evidence of BWC’s effects that use only short study periods. Lastly, BWCs are not associated with any change in officer arrest behavior in the aggregate. I obtain robust and precise null estimates for arrests for assault/battery and theft/robbery. However, exploring arrest behavior more deeply exposes that following BWC adoption, officers make 0.63 fewer drug-related arrests per district-day. This is a large 24% decrease. Several hypotheses for this reduction are discussed, one such hypothesis consistent with this decline is de-policing.====Since BWCs became a topic of national debate in 2015, scholars have worked to pin down their effects. Research until recently has relied on RCT evidence that use a small handful of volunteer officers (many have fewer than 100 officers) that have been randomized to use (or not use) BWCs. Researchers should be careful when extrapolating results from small police departments to larger ones that face very different circumstances. These articles also vary significantly both in terms of magnitude and sign of the measured effects. In a review of this literature Lum et al. (2019) finds that ”the use of BWCs does not have consistent or significant effects on officers’ use-of-force, arrest activities, proactive or self-initiated activities, or other measured behaviors.” In fact, several papers find that BWCs increase use-of-force (Ariel et al., 2015), some find decreases (Ariel, Farrar, Sutherland, 2015, Ariel, Sutherland, Henstock, Young, Drover, Sykes, Megicks, Henderson, 2017, Braga, Coldren, Sousa, Rodriguez, Alper, 2017, Braga, Sousa, Coldren, Rodriguez, 2018, Ready, Young, 2015), and others find no change (Jennings, Lynch, Fridell, 2015, Yokum, Ravishankar, Coppock, 2019). These differences in findings call into question whether BWCs are an effective or valuable policy intervention.====This paper adds to the literature in several ways. First, this paper leverages extensive information about officer actions, most importantly, use-of-force. Measuring frequency and intensity of use-of-force by officers helps to unpack the changes we see in complaints. This is especially important in this context, since BWCs can change the likelihood that a civilian files a complaint. This paper supports the findings of Zamoff et al. (2021) and Braga et al. (2022), which study how BWCs affect officer stops and citizen complaints and relate them to a developing literature on the determinants of officer use-of-force (Ba, Knox, Mummolo, Rivera, 2021, Fryer Jr, 2019, Hoekstra, Sloan, 2020, Johnson, Tress, Burkel, Taylor, Cesario, 2019, Weisburst, 2019). Second, this paper explores the effect of BWCs on civilians. In the past, data limitations have made this analysis difficult since civilian actions are often not recorded. In Chicago, officers report the amount of force used by civilians and when a civilian resists arrest or assaults an officer. This allows me to explore an important side of these two-sided officer-civilian interactions. Third, this paper provides evidence of BWCs effectiveness in a diverse new environment, Chicago, which has not been studied in the literature. The Chicago Police Department (CPD) is one of the largest in the United States and is responsible for policing 2.7 million people. Crime is committed frequently in Chicago, in 2019 there were a total of 25,545 violent crimes and 81,153 property crimes committed, this equates to almost 300 violent or property crimes per day (CPD, 2019). This rate of crime is above the national average but importantly is driven by a high rate of violent crime; Chicago has the seventh highest murder rate in the country (Monkovic and Asher, 2021). This data on use-of-force, citizen-filed complaints, and reports of crime, which document the same police force over the same period of time, allows a holistic approach to uncovering the effect of BWCs.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 I provide background for BWCs in the US and detail their adoption into Chicago, I additionally detail several instances where BWCs have had large societal impacts. In Section 3, I review the multiple data sources that I use and the empirical methods of this paper. In Section 4, I present my results on complaint counts, officer reported force, and officer arrest behavior.

We estimate the ==== of public housing projects in South Africa by comparing changes near 166 projects that were successfully constructed to changes near 140 projects that were planned but not constructed. Constructed projects triple the amount of formal housing inside their footprints and lead to one new informal house being built for every three new formal houses. These effects extend beyond project footprints, with small increases in both formal and informal housing detected up to 500m from the targeted areas. The findings are consistent with projects generating positive housing externalities.","30% of urban populations in developing countries live in slums characterized by overcrowding and informal houses made of non-durable material (United Nations, 2015). Dense slums often produce congestion and unsanitary conditions, which discourage new housing construction and infrastructure investments (Marx et al., 2013). To break this cycle, cities target slums with place-based policies such as land titling, slum upgrading, and public housing projects. Across Africa, governments have provided over 5.4 million houses from 2500 in Benin to 3 million in South Africa (Bah et al., 2018).====In developing cities, slum conditions may amplify the welfare effects of place-based policies. Policies that upgrade slums with improved housing may yield additional benefits by reducing congestion, improving sanitation, and inviting infrastructure investment. Policies can also have unintended consequences by attracting new slum growth. For example, low-density public housing projects may leave room for households to build low-quality houses in the backyards of project houses (Brueckner et al., 2018). Dense backyard housing may recreate unsanitary conditions and depress neighborhood property investment. The net effects of these policies remain an empirical question that has implications for designing place-based policies in developing cities.====This paper asks how public housing projects affect population growth, housing development, and public services in areas within project footprints as well as areas nearby project footprints. We examine these effects in the context of South African housing projects. While South Africa has a higher average income than many of its sub-Saharan counterparts, housing projects are often located in undeveloped areas that share many similarities with urban slums across Africa.==== Annually since 1994, the South African government acquires parcels of land and contracts the construction of many housing projects. Projects consist of (1) building neighborhoods of new single-story, two-room houses each on their own plot of land, (2) allocating full ownership of houses to recipient households, and (3) servicing houses with basic infrastructure including water, electricity, community centers, and other complementary investments. Housing projects range widely in size from a few dozen to several hundred houses per project.====We compile detailed spatial data in 2001 and 2011 for the Johannesburg metro-area including household census data, deeds records of formal housing transactions, and a remote-sensed survey of all buildings. These data allow us to measure the medium-term outcomes for housing projects built between 2001 and 2011. The building survey provides a novel measure of slum growth by distinguishing between formal and informal house types. Our main outcomes are population, formal and informal housing density, formal house prices, infrastructure investments, and demographics. To measure impacts across multiple spatial datasets, we create a uniform unit of analysis by overlaying gridded 100 by 100m plots of land across all areas within 4 km of projects and computing average measures within each plot.====Our empirical strategy compares changes in outcomes for exposure to 166 constructed projects to changes in outcomes for exposure to 140 planned, but unconstructed projects. We measure project exposure for each plot of land based on the area that each plot overlaps with project footprints. For plots outside of project footprints, we calculate the area for which each plot’s immediate neighborhood overlaps with project footprints. Since housing projects are often clustered near each other, the measure allows plots to be exposed to multiple projects at varying intensities.====The empirical strategy addresses two main challenges in measuring the impacts of housing projects. First, projects are often located not only in poor neighborhoods, but also on relatively undeveloped plots of land within these neighborhoods. Comparing projects to neighboring areas would likely capture these preexisting differences. Our strategy controls for these differences because constructed and unconstructed projects are often located on similar types of land plots in similar types of neighborhoods. Second, projects are often located in rapidly growing cities with high demand for housing. Measuring the evolution of project areas would likely also capture urban growth that is unrelated to the projects. Our strategy controls for trends in urban development by comparing relative growth across areas with constructed projects and areas with unconstructed projects.====The empirical strategy identifies the causal effect of housing projects under the assumption that plots exposed to constructed projects would have evolved in the same way as plots similarly exposed to unconstructed projects in the absence of construction. Our approach leverages how planned housing projects must satisfy many procedural hurdles to be eligible for construction (ie. environmental impact assessments, zoning approvals, infrastructure plans), which may be relatively uncorrelated with local trends in development.====We observe that in the pre-period, areas near constructed projects have more houses and people than areas near unconstructed projects. This pattern is consistent with mismeasurement of construction status where some projects were actually completed prior to our pre-period data. This mismeasurement would lead comparisons of constructed and unconstructed projects to underestimate the effect of project construction. Another explanation is that local authorities prioritize dense, slum areas for project construction. To address these concerns, we show that our main results are similar to analyzing only project footprints without houses in the pre-period or balancing on pre-period characteristics. We also find limited evidence of pre-trends in census outcomes.====We find that constructed projects largely succeed in their three goals of building, allocating, and servicing project houses. The numbers of formal houses and people living in formal houses triple in constructed projects relative to unconstructed projects. New formal houses are well-serviced with basic utilities and largely resemble other formal houses in project areas. Projects do not seem to change the demographics of people living in formal housing in project areas.====We also observe that projects have the unintended consequence of stimulating large increases in informal housing within project footprints. One new informal house is built for every three new formal houses. The growth of informal housing is driven entirely by informal dwellings built in the backyards of formal dwellings (Brueckner et al., 2018).====We then estimate spillover effects nearby projects. Between 0 and 0.5 km from project footprints, we find positive effects that are statistically significant for population and house growth with informal houses outpacing formal houses. Estimates imply that on average, each project invites nearby growth of 66 formal houses, 103 informal, backyard houses, and 27 informal, non-backyard houses.==== These results are consistent with housing projects supporting government goals “to use money available for housing development in a manner which stimulates private investment in, and the contributions of individuals to housing development.”==== We also estimate that prices for formal housing transactions increase by 9% up to 0.5 km from project footprints although this result is statistically indistinguishable from zero.====To explain positive spillover effects, we consider three potential mechanisms.====On the whole, we find that infrastructure investment and business growth within projects may not extend to neighboring areas. Positive housing externalities remain a plausible explanation for the positive housing spillovers observed in our analysis.====This paper contributes to growing research on place-based policies. Studies in the US compare changes in outcomes either (1) near versus far from project areas==== or (2) in constructed versus planned, but unconstructed project areas.==== Most closely related to our work, Diamond and McQuade (2019) find that public housing projects in the US increase housing prices in low-income neighborhoods and decrease housing prices in high-income neighborhoods. Since we focus on a developing context with pervasive informal housing, our study differs in two main ways. First, in these settings, it may be important to account for spatial outcomes within project footprints such as backyard housing. Second, to the extent that informal housing grows in response to place-based policies and is itself a negative amenity, informal housing may undermine policy goals of producing positive amenities.====Our study is largely consistent with the existing literature on place-based policies in developing countries. Our finding that housing projects invite growth of informal housing parallels the finding by Harari and Wong (2018) that slum formalization generates declines in local land values and levels of formalization in Jakarta, Indonesia. At the same time, we also document improvements in formal housing quality that are similar to those observed by Michaels et al. (2021) as a result of a sites-and-services program in Tanzania. Our estimates of positive spillover effects mirror the findings of Gechter and Tsivanidis (2020) who link changes in Mumbai’s zoning laws to formal housing development and higher nearby property prices. Like the study of a housing lottery in Ethiopia by Franklin (2019), we do not find evidence of large effects on employment or demographic characteristics of housing recipients as a result of housing projects.====Our study also relates to recent research on South Africa’s national housing program focusing on outcomes for direct beneficiaries of project houses. Using household surveys, studies estimate the effect of receiving a project house on women’s labor supply: Picarelli (2019) finds negative effects nationally while Franklin (2020) finds positive effects in Capetown. Franklin (2020) also shows that planned, but unconstructed projects may provide useful counterfactuals to estimate project effects in this context.====We proceed by first providing background information on public housing and the South African national housing program in Section 2. Section 3 describes the data used to measure outcomes and details our approach to identifying housing projects. Motivated with descriptive evidence in 4 Descriptive statistics for project neighborhoods at baseline, 5 Empirical methodology lays out the estimation strategy and identifying assumptions. Section 6 presents our main results and Section 7 explores possible mechanisms. Section 8 tests the sensitivity of the results to alternative specifications.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, close to 40,000 gun-related deaths were recorded in 2017 - the highest in the last 50 years (Murphy et al., 2019). High-profile mass shootings at Columbine High School, Virginia Tech, the Orlando nightclub, and the Las Vegas concert, to name a few, further prompted widespread pushes for stricter regulations to reduce gun violence. For instance, six states, including Florida, Washington, Vermont, California, Illinois, and Hawaii, have banned sales of assault rifles to adults under 21 years old (Giffords, 2022). Many states also adopted ”red flag laws” allowing law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from individuals deemed to be an imminent threat (Freking, 2022).====A nascent strategy that is being considered by several cities to combat gun violence is the gun offender registry. Criminal registries have been used to mandate ex-sex offenders to report and reveal their locations of residence so that law enforcers, government agencies and the public can keep track of their whereabouts. Following the acceptance and popularity of sex offender registries, many cities and states are proposing to establish a registry for ex-gun offenders. Some examples include New York City in 2006, Baltimore in 2007, Washington D.C. in 2009, Chicago in 2010, Connecticut in 2013, and Washington State in 2013. Currently, only Chicago and Baltimore release their registries publicly as the rest restrict the access to only law enforcers and government agencies.====Policy makers and the public have mixed reactions towards these criminal registries. On one hand, authorities assert that these registries can reduce recidivism rates by improving surveillance and allowing easier apprehension when ex-gun convicts re-offend. For instance, Braga et al. (2014) has shown that ex-gun offenders in Baltimore who appeared in the gun offender registry in 2008, the first year the registry was introduced, had fewer subsequent charges than ex-gun offenders convicted before the registry was established. On the other hand, many have questioned the effectiveness of such registries, claiming that they are a waste of resources and a burden to both law enforcement and ex-offenders. The Baltimore Sun, the largest daily newspaper in Maryland, reported that being on the public registry could make it difficult for ex-offenders to find housing and work. For instance, Dana Hayes Junior, an accountant at the Baltimore Police Department, was forced to leave his job due to his prior gun charges that landed him on the registry. Although his charges were later expunged by a judge, he was unfairly stigmatized by the gun offender registry (Baltimore-Sun, 2022).====In this paper, we measure the willingness to pay to avoid gun crime risk by measuring households’ responses towards the information provided by the gun offender registry on housing values in Baltimore, Maryland. The gun offender registry publicly discloses the name, move-in dates, and address of ex-gun offenders after their releases from the correction facilities.==== We combine detailed information associated with the 1,411 ex-gun convicts from 2008 with housing transactions from 2006 to 2018. Specifically, we adopt a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference framework to examine how housing values change before and after ex-gun offenders relocate into a neighborhood. As we are aware of the exact locations of ex-gun offenders’ residences, we can further restrict our analysis to homes close to their residences to minimize unobserved neighborhood differences across space. If informed households react to information from the gun registry and relocate from these ex-gun offenders due to fear of crime, holding all other differences constant, our estimates measure the households’ marginal willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce the risk of crime victimization.====Our empirical findings show that properties close to ex-gun offenders’ residences experience a sharp drop in values after ex-gun offenders relocate into the neighborhoods. In particular, house prices within a 0.1-mile radius from ex-gun offenders’ residences are 8.0% lower (about $12,632 in absolute terms) compared to those from 0.2 to 0.3 miles. These effects are highly localized and dissipate with distance from ex-gun offenders’ residences. These findings are robust to a battery of different specifications, providing strong causal evidence that homeowners pay more to avoid these ex-gun offenders. Additional results indicate that risk averse homeowners who are living in safer neighborhoods, and who are less used to residing near ex-gun offenders are more responsive to these move-ins. We also observe that homeowners respond more negatively in neighborhoods that contain multiple ex-offenders. Finally, we do not report a pronounced increase in crime rates after an ex-gun offender relocates into the neighborhood. This suggests that homeowners are responding in the housing markets out of fear rather than actually experiencing more crime near their residences.====Our study relates closely to the literature studying the impacts of sex offender registry on housing values, pioneered by Linden and Rockoff (2008) and Pope (2008). They document that houses prices within 0.1 miles from sex offenders’ residences are between 2.3% (Pope, 2008) and 4% (Linden and Rockoff, 2008) lower after ex-sex offenders moved in. Kim and Lee (2018) extend the literature to South Korea and show that house prices within 150 m from offenders’ residences fall by 5.5%. This effect appears highly transient and disappears after one month.====We contribute to the existing literature in the following ways: first, we improve the estimation of the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid crime risk by exploiting quasi-experimental variation in perceived crime risk from the gun offender registry. Challenges associated with the consistent estimation of WTP parameters, such as omitted variable bias and reverse causality, are well documented in the literature (Rosen, 1974, Greenstone, 2017). Many studies, including ours, tackle these identification challenges by focusing on ”natural experiments” to generate an exogenous shock to the amenity of interest to estimate WTP parameters.====Second, we examine how publicly revealing ex-gun offenders’ residences affects local housing values and crime rates. This policy is fairly new and has yet been studied in the literature. While the existing literature on sex offender registries measures the fear towards sex victimization, our study reveals how much homeowners are willing to pay to avoid the risk of gun crime victimization. Finally, our analysis on local crime rates after these ex-gun offenders move-in sheds light on whether they make neighborhoods more dangerous, or households are simply responding in the housing market out of fear. This allows us to understand the mechanisms of which ex-gun offenders are influencing local housing values.====The study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the Gun Offender Registry Act (GORA) in Baltimore. Section 3 describes the various data sources employed in this study, before presenting the summary statistics and preliminary graphical evidence of the impact of ex-gun offenders’ relocation on local house prices. Section 4 illustrates our economic framework to estimate the impact of gun offender registry on house prices and crime rates, and Section 5 presents the estimated results using this framework. Section 6 discusses the implications of our findings and concludes the study.",Crime risk and housing values: Evidence from the gun offender registry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022001024,17 January 2023,2023,Research Article,13.0

In this paper we study how firms react to ","Tropical cyclones generate an annual average of US $26 billion of damages worldwide, which are predicted to quadruple to US $100 billion by 2100. According to Mendelsohn et al. (2012), this rise will be caused in equal proportion by increases in the wealth and population located in cyclone-prone areas and by changes in the intensity of cyclones due to climate change (Scott, Stone, Allen, 2004, Webster, Holland, Curry, Chang, 2005, Emanuel, 2005, Emanuel, 2011, Emanuel, 2021).==== In this context, understanding how firms respond to tropical cyclones is important to enhance disaster preparedness and reduce disaster risk.==== This knowledge is even more relevant for developing countries, which suffer the worse consequences of climate change and have only limited resources available for adaptation and reconstruction (Hallegatte et al., 2018). Yet, there is little evidence so far on how firms in developing countries adjust their inputs and production pattern post-disaster.====In this paper we study the response of firms to storms in India. We first estimate the impacts of cyclones on firms’ physical capital and sales. Second, we analyze the dynamics of these impacts and examine how long it takes for firms to rebuild and reboot. We then study the heterogeneity of these impacts by firm and industry quality, effectively looking at adjustments across and within industries. In the analysis we use of a novel and exogenous measure of firm exposure to storms, constructed from variation in wind intensities across postal codes and firms’ establishments.====With a coastline of 7516 km, India is exposed to roughly 10% of the world’s cyclones, making it one of the most affected regions in the world. Annually, over 370 million people are affected by cyclones (storms with winds traveling faster than 33 knots) in India alone.==== The government of India reports that cyclonic winds are typically associated with extensive damages to structures (e.g., residential and private buildings, public infrastructures).==== The potential for damages on structures is exacerbated by the fact that construction and engineering laws and regulations are not always enforced, professional knowledge is sometimes lacking, and structures often have inadequate foundations and use poor quality materials.==== While resilience has improved over time, India is still extremely vulnerable today and considerable efforts are continuously being made to help mitigate the impacts of cyclones.====The literature on the impact of natural disasters often assumes that, through their destruction, disasters foster a more rapid turnover of capital within industries, causing firms to upgrade old capital with newer and more productive vintages (e.g., Hallegatte and Dumas, 2009). Following heterogeneous firms frameworks, it is rather standard to expect differential impacts within industry depending on firm productivity. Resources may also reallocate ====. We expect that reconstruction will be more pronounced in better-performing industries, i.e., industries where the marginal product of capital is relatively high.==== This may happen because the destruction of capital allows new resources to flow to the best currently available opportunities. Economic conditions change over time, thus decisions that were optimal in the past may no longer be optimal today. Yet, due to the irreversible nature of investments and the industry specificity of capital, firms often stick to their past decisions as long as the revenues generated from their activity cover at least part of the sunk costs incurred. Our conjecture is that, by destroying capital, storms create an opportunity to re-invest, adapt production, and reallocate resources to better-performing industries.====The data we use in our analysis is from Prowess, a panel of firms covering the period 1995–2006 and containing the financial statements of 6037 manufacturing firms. Every firm is identified by its name and the location of its headquarters. Since production rarely occurs at the headquarters, identifying the location of each of the establishments belonging to a firm is crucial to construct a precise measure of firm exposure to storms. We use the googleplaces algorithm to supplement the Prowess dataset with the coordinates of each of the establishments of a firm. We then construct a yearly firm-specific measure that accounts for the maximum wind exposure at the headquarters and the establishments using storms’ best-track data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).====We first estimate the impacts of cyclones on firms’ physical capital and sales and find that the average cyclone reduces firms sales by 3.1% and destroys 2.2% of firms’ fixed assets. This latter effect is consistent across different types of fixed assets, such as land and buildings. A cyclone at the 90th (10th) percentile of the distribution destroys 8.7% (0.3%) of the fixed assets and decreases sales by 7.8% (0.5%). Salaries instead are not affected, suggesting that most of the impact of a storm on a firm works through capital. We then analyze the dynamics of these impacts and find that the impacts of the storms are short lived and indicate a fast recovery, with reconstruction occurring to a larger extent in better-performing industries.====Finally, we study the heterogeneity of these impacts by firm and industry quality. We measure industrial performance using the Balassa index of revealed comparative advantage and firm quality with total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings show that after a storm, capital reallocates toward better-performing industries. This result is mirrored in the pattern of production, with sales shifting toward the top of the comparative advantage distribution. This shift is driven by firms adjusting their production mix within an existing set of industries rather than by firms investing in new industry production lines.====Moreover, in terms of heterogeneity within industry, we find that the shock has differential impacts on sales but not capital. There is no evidence of, within industry, capital flowing toward more productive firms or toward firms characterized by a high marginal revenue product of capital (MRPK). Hence, our estimates indicate that movements of capital are linked to industry quality rather than to firm productivity. However, regarding sales, the results show that within industry, the least productive firms are affected relatively more by storms and experience larger decreases in sales (in percentage).==== Finally, both across- and within-industry adjustments of sales are equally important and, as expected, depend on the capital intensity of industries. These results hold across a variety of robustness tests.====This paper adds to the growing literature on the impact of storms.==== Several studies have looked at the impact of natural disasters on economic outcomes, such as fiscal policy, financial aid, investment, consumption growth, exports, or precautionary savings (for a survey of aggregate impacts, see Cavallo, Noy, 2010, Dell, Jones, Olken, 2014). A large body of the literature focuses on economic growth, either using cross-country or within-country data. For instance, Strobl (2011) looks at the economic growth impact of hurricanes across US coastal counties, while Cavallo et al. (2013) examine the average causal impact of natural disasters on economic growth using synthetic controls and counterfactual analysis. Hsiang and Jina (2014) review the hypotheses advanced by the literature concerning the effects of hurricanes on long-run economic growth across countries: creative destruction/build back better (e.g., Skidmore, Toya, 2002, Cuaresma, Hlouskova, Obersteiner, 2008) and recovery to trend/no recovery (e.g., Miguel and Roland, 2011).====More recently, the literature has turned to the adjustment of firms to tropical cyclones. For instance, Elliott et al. (2019) find that cyclones have a considerable negative impact on Chinese firms’ performance. Similarly to our findings, this effect is relatively short lived. Seetharam (2018) examines the spatial propagation of job losses occurring within multi-plant firms across undisrupted distant regions in the US. The author finds that within a firm, for every job lost in a county hit by a cyclone, 0.19–0.25 jobs are lost across other regions, suggesting that the network of establishments tend to propagate the effect of a cyclone. Using US administrative data, Basker and Miranda (2018) study firm survival after Hurricane Katrina. They find that smaller and less productive businesses have lower survival rates, while larger and more productive firms hire more. Vu and Noy (2018) look at firms in Vietnam and find that while cyclones have a negative impact on retail sales, they lead to an increase in investments, with large differences between urban and rural areas.====To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to unpack the heterogeneity of the effects of storms on firms within and across industries in a major developing country where the dynamics of adjustment may differ from those encountered in a high-income country. Our findings suggest that in the aftermath of storms, in addition to replacing old capital with newer and more productive vintages, firms also tend to re-optimize their production structure by switching to better-performing industries. This additional adjustment mechanism is important because it may help to boost recovery and economic growth. For the design of post-disaster policies, our results indicate that on the firm side, undiscriminating policies, which are easier to implement and potentially less costly than targeted policies, can be successful at helping firms cope with disasters. While undiscriminating policies might work at the firm level, some firms and industries are still going to be more affected than others, and therefore it is crucial that the government assists workers who must switch to a different firm and/or industry.",In the eye of the storm: Firms and capital destruction in India,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009411902200105X,13 January 2023,2023,Research Article,14.0

However, little is known about their long-run outcomes or the consequences of ending such services. We investigate both aspects by examining the long-run effects of an intensive support program on the housing, employment, and health outcomes of chronically homeless people in Australia. Evaluating the three-year program over six-years using a randomised controlled trial, we document substantially higher rates of housing and better employment outcomes during the program period for the treated group, but no substantial changes in health. Three years after the program ends, we observe no significant differences between the treatment and control group with respect to any outcomes, including housing. Our results imply that stable housing is a necessary but not sufficient condition to overcome multiple sources of economic and social disadvantage.","Homelessness is an extreme form of socioeconomic disadvantage that imposes substantial costs on individuals and society. At the individual level, homelessness correlates strongly with poor mental and physical health, high rates of substance misuse, and substantially higher mortality (e.g. Barrow, Herman, Cordova, Struening, 1999, Fazel, Khosla, Doll, Geddes, 2008, Hwang, 2000). The societal costs range from direct costs on shelter facilities, to indirect costs that include government spending on health care, welfare, and justice costs related to homelessness (e.g., Latimer, Rabouin, Cao, Ly, Powell, Aubry, Distasio, Hwang, Somers, Stergiopoulos, et al., 2017, Culhane, 2008). The majority of these costs are incurred by a small subset of the homeless population, often referred to as the chronically homeless. This group includes individuals who have been homeless for long periods of time, often cycling between the street, institutions, and poor quality temporary accommodation, and is characterised by high rates of substance misuse, poor mental health, traumatic experiences, and social exclusion.====The predominant model for addressing chronic homelessness worldwide currently is the Housing First approach, which emerged in the US in the early 1990s (e.g., Evans, Phillips, Ruffini, 2021, O’Flaherty, 2019). The key characteristic of Housing First models is the absence of preconditions for permanent housing, which clearly distinguishes Housing First models from traditional models that have a narrow crisis focus with a strong emphasis on short-term housing interventions. Extant evidence demonstrates that Housing First approaches produce superior housing outcomes compared to treatment-as-usual approaches (for related literature, see Appendix B). However, the existing literature does not document whether these improvements persist over time or what happens once intensive support services are withdrawn.====Our paper uses a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to study the long-term impact of an intensive support program, the Journey to Social Inclusion (J2SI), on the housing and non-housing outcomes of chronically homeless individuals. We make the following contributions. First, we examine the outcomes of a new intensive support program aimed at ending chronic homelessness. This intervention draws on many of the core principles from Housing First approaches, such as immediate access to housing without preconditions, but combines several other components in one treatment package. These include a very low case load, a three-year support period, the provision of therapeutic and mental health support, the provision of a skills development program, and a focus on chronically homeless individuals, regardless of mental health or substance abuse issues. Taken together, to the best of our knowledge, no existing Housing First model or traditional service offered a similar package of integrated services provided over a three-year period of intensive support.====Second, we follow individuals for six years after random assignment, and we observe their outcomes for up to three years after the abrupt end of the program. Examining outcomes three years after the end of the program provides unique insights into what happens when intensive support services are withdrawn. It needs to be stressed that following homeless individuals for such a long time is notoriously difficult as the population we study is relatively small, very mobile and thus very difficult to track (e.g., see Evans et al., 2021). Within this context, a limiting though inherent factor is the small sample size which affects the precision, though not the internal validity, of our estimates.====Third, most studies that use RCTs to evaluate homelessness interventions originate from the US. However, the economic, social, and institutional contexts of the US may not be comparable to other countries, particularly countries with stronger social safety nets and universal health insurance. We contribute the first rigorous Australian evaluation using an RCT to this small literature. Australia is an interesting point of comparison as its public expenses on social protection, which includes universal health insurance, lie somewhere between the US and Northern Europe (ILO, 2017).====Fourth, we examine the effect of the program on important secondary non-housing outcomes, particularly employment and health. Although previous studies have examined these outcomes as well, we uniquely examine these outcomes at nine points in time over a period of six years after random assignment. Although many interventions aim at improving these non-housing outcomes, extant evidence suggests they have little impact, although many studies have low statistical power (Evans et al., 2021). With the same caveat in mind, we still provide new long-run evidence on these important non-housing outcomes.====To preview our results: During the support period, the program significantly improved the housing outcomes of the treated group—largely driven by improvements in public housing—alongside some significant improvements in employment outcomes. We find no substantial improvements in health outcomes. Six years after randomisation, around two thirds of all individuals are housed, but we observe no differences between the treatment and control groups with respect to housing. This convergence in housing rates is largely driven by improvements in housing for the control group. The point estimates suggest no long-run effects on non-housing outcomes. Taken together, our results imply that an intensive support and housing intervention helps boosting housing rates in the short run but may not be sufficient to overcome multiple sources of economic and social disadvantage in the long-run.","JUE Insight: Making it home?

This paper uses comprehensive data on employment by place of work and place of residency to study if TIF districts see an increase in jobs as a result of designation, and whether the residents in neighborhoods designated as TIF districts see employment benefits from the designation. To account for the endogenous selection of TIF areas, I implement a ","The Chicago Avenue stop in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, and the 63rd Street stop in Englewood are both on the Red Line of the city’s “L” train system. That is where the similarities between the two stops ends. Only 2% of Streeterville residents are Black while nearly 95% of Englewood is African American, and the life expectancy of a baby born in Streeterville is the highest in the city at an average lifespan of ninety years while a baby born in Englewood cannot expect to live much past sixty years old.==== These facts suggest that Chicago is quite segregated along both income (Reardon, Bischoff, 2011, Darden, 1987), and racial lines (Betancur, 1996, Taeuber, Taeuber, 1964). These vast differences in residential characteristics across relatively small geographic areas lead to undesirable outcomes for many Chicagoans (Mulder, 2015). In response to this, there have been a multitude of government-led and non-profit efforts to improve living conditions in the Windy City. The largest one to date by dollar value is tax increment financing (TIF), an economic development tool used by the City of Chicago to promote both public and private investment across the city. This study assesses the impact that TIF has had on job creation within the city. Relatedly, I will explore if these jobs are going to residents that are living in or around the TIF area, and if this program causes a neighborhood’s demographic characteristics to change, i.e. gentrification.====At its simplest, a TIF program has two steps. First, a geographic area is designated as a TIF district. The size of this geographic area can vary widely from a single parcel of land to an entire city. Once an area is designated a TIF, the amount of equalized assessed property value of the area in the designation year is set as the base Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) amount. As property values increase, the amount of property tax revenue above the EAV amount, or the “increment”, is earmarked for redevelopment projects within the district.==== The stated goal of the TIF program in Chicago is, “To help local companies expand and create employment opportunities for Chicago residents”.==== In the economics literature, TIF programs have been justified theoretically as a means to provide needed investment in local public goods provision which could influence the business location decisions of employers (Brueckner, 2001, Donaghy, Elson, Knaap, 1999).====Using comprehensive employment data at the census block level from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics survey, I implement a propensity score matching dynamic difference-in-differences model to estimate the effect that Chicago’s extensive TIF system has had on employment across the city. My empirical model deals with the substantial endogeneity concerns inherent in the TIF designation process in two ways. First, the dynamic nature of the difference-in-difference estimates exploits the differential timing of TIF designation to construct a valid counterfactual that exploits the differential timing of TIF designation. Second, my approach includes a propensity score matching procedure that better matches treated blocks with control blocks based upon both the cross section, and trends in the block covariates. This approach constructs a better control group than simply using areas that are never treated as the counterfactual as these areas can have quite divergent employment trends. The propensity score matching procedure also creates a superior comparison group when compared with studies that use spatial discontinuities as these studies are subject to bias if there are any spillover effects.====The multiple strategies used to address policy endogeneity represent a major improvement over previous studies on the effect of TIF on economic activity. Furthermore, the analysis is done at the census block level which is the finest geographic level available. This increased granularity not only allows for enhanced statistical power to identify the effects of TIF designation but also allows for a better geographic match of treated areas to actual TIF boundaries. Finally, the data used is comprehensive employment data that covers the vast majority (96%) of private employees. All of these innovations and improvements represent an important contribution to our understanding of the effects of TIF and other place-based tax policies designed to stimulate economic development in a region.====Figure 1 shows suggestive evidence that TIF can influence where jobs are located in Chicago. This figure divides the city into two regions: one region that is ever part of a TIF, and another that is never part of a TIF. Then, the total number of jobs located in each of these two regions is plotted over time. In 2002, areas of the city that are “Never TIF” have far more jobs than areas that the “Ever TIF” sections of the city. This is to be expected as TIF regions are considered blighted in some way. Over the course of this study however, employment levels in these two areas converge and in 2017, jobs are essentially split evenly between these two areas of the city. Figure 1 also shows the interesting trend in Chicago that the number of jobs in Chicago has been increasing over time even while the population of the city is declining.====Results of this study indicate that TIF designation has a long-term effect of increasing employment in selected census block by 15.2%. On the other hand, residential employment in the designated census blocks does not see any increase over the same time period. These results suggest TIF is able to stimulate employment growth in an area, but does not ensure that those jobs will directly benefit the local community. I will also provide evidence against these employment results being the result of reverse causality or other endogenous reasons outside of TIF treatment status. Heterogeneous employment effects of TIF across industries is also explored. Evidence is also presented that suggests much of the employment gains are seen by African American and Hispanic Chicagoans, and that there are positive employment spillovers to blocks adjacent to TIFs. Finally, I explore changes in block group characteristics over the course of the study to investigate neighborhood compositional changes caused by TIF designation, and find minimal effects.====This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 introduces the institutional background of TIF in Chicago and reviews the economic literature on TIF, Section 3 describes the data used in this study, Section 4 outlines the empirical approach, Section 5 presents results, and Section 6 concludes.",The effect of tax increment financing districts on job creation in Chicago,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022000869,30 December 2022,2022,Research Article,17.0

Indeed, there is a strong positive ","In recent decades the long-run exodus from central cities in the United States has slowed and, in some areas, reversed direction. Some of these new residents are higher socioeconomic status (SES) than the current population in cities, a phenomenon colloquially known as “gentrification.” Many politicians and members of the public hold a strong (and untested) belief that condominium development contributes to gentrification because it allows residence in dense urban neighborhoods to be bundled with the income tax advantages and other benefits of homeownership that are attractive to high income households.====We test – and ultimately reject – that condo development in and of itself attracts significant numbers of high-SES residents to central cities. We do find strong ==== between the condo share of housing units and the income, education and racial composition of local residents. However, any observed correlation could be driven by the (endogenous) construction decisions of developers, who may respond to the perceived demand for condos in areas otherwise valued by high-income households.====We take advantage of variation in the passage of municipal codes regulating condominium conversions to identify the causal effect of condo availability on gentrification. The condominium only became a legally recognized form of owner-occupancy in the United States in the 1960s. In response, some cities – particularly large cities in coastal areas – passed restrictive regulations in the 1970s and 1980s, governing the conversion of multi-family buildings to condo units. These regulations functioned like a housing supply constraint, in that cities that passed such regulations have a lower condo share in their housing stock even today. Yet we find that variation in the condo share induced by differences in local regulations is ==== associated with ‘gentrifying’ characteristics, including higher income or education level or lower Black share or share in poverty.====Our data analysis is based on newly collected archival information on the passage of city-level conversion ordinances for the 100 largest cities. We merge this information with data on the condo share of the housing stock at the Census tract level, taken from the Neighborhood Change Database in 1980 and a special Census extract in 2010. We compare 13 metropolitan areas anchored by a central city that passed a restrictive condo ordinance after 1980 to 50 metropolitan areas anchored by central cities that had not yet passed an ordinance by 2010.====Our findings derive from a triple-difference specification: we compare central cities that passed restrictive ordinances to those that never passed an ordinance before the initial passage of the law (1980) and afterwards (2010). Regardless of the city's regulatory structure, the suburbs in our sample did not regulate the process of converting rental units to condominiums, in part because few suburbs had a multi-family housing stock conducive to conversions in this period. So, as a third difference, we incorporate data on the suburban ring of each city, which allows us to control for common metropolitan level trends.====One concern is that suburban areas may follow a different growth trend than the core central city, and thus may not adequately control for metropolitan area trends. To address this concern, we conduct our analysis both for the full sample of city/suburban tracts and for a narrower sample of tracts close to the city/suburban border. Indeed, adjacent neighborhoods across borders are far more similar on baseline characteristics, yet we continue to find in this sample that policy-driven variation in condo construction affects the condo share in the housing stock but is not associated with resident characteristics.====According to a recent survey of the economics of gentrification, the current literature focuses on demand factors for gentrifying neighborhoods and offers “less understanding of the causal role of redevelopment decisions [and housing] supply constraints” on the gentrification process (Hwang and Lin, 2016, p. 21). Our paper highlights regulations that restrict the conversion of rental properties to condo use, acting as a constraint on the redevelopment cycle that can occur as aging housing stock in the central city is replaced, thereby attracting higher-income residents (Brueckner and Rosenthal, 2009). It is important to distinguish demand-driven from supply-led gentrification because they have different implications for policy. If the presence of new luxury housing supply leads to gentrification, some supply restrictions may be warranted. If, instead, gentrification is primarily due to rising demand for urban living, supply restrictions could “perversely amplify housing price increases and subsequent displacement effects” (Hwang and Lin, 2016, p. 10).====By ruling out the importance of one common housing supply regulation (restrictions on condo conversions), our paper bolsters the current consensus that gentrification primarily reflects a growing demand for urban living, such as a rising value that workers place on living close to their place of employment, a byproduct of higher work hours and increases in female labor force participation (Kahn, 2007; Edlund et al., 2021; Su, 2022). Falling crime rates and increasing availability of local amenities such as restaurants, shopping, and cultural venues, as well as the endogenous value placed on proximity to other wealthy residents themselves, may also play a role (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2006; Ellen and O'Regan, 2010; Guerrieri et al., 2013; Foote, 2015; Diamond, 2016; Carlino and Saiz, 2019;  Ellen et al., 2019; Baum-Snow and Hartley, 2020; Couture et al., 2019; Couture et al., 2020; Behrens et al., 2022). Our analysis of condo regulations is related to papers using policy variation to identify the effects of local rent control (Sims, 2007, 2011; Autor et al., 2014, 2019; Diamond et al., 2019) and spatial regression discontinuities across city/suburban borders to identify the effects of land use regulations and the valuation of public goods (Black and Machin, 2011; Boustan, 2012;Turner et al., 2014).",JUE Insight: Condominium development does not lead to gentrification,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022001000,29 December 2022,2022,Research Article,18.0

We study local government fiscal dynamics in the aftermath of hurricanes. These shocks reduce tax revenues, public expenditures, and debt financing in the decade following a hurricane. Hurricanes create collateral fiscal damage for local governments by increasing the cost of debt at critical moments after a strike. Municipalities with a 1 standard deviation-above-average racial minority composition suffer expenditure losses more than 2 times larger and debt default risk 8 times larger than the average municipalities in the decade following a hurricane strike.","Local governments are essential providers of public goods and services utilized by Americans every day. Sanitation, policing, parks and recreation, public transit, and street maintenance are a subset of the wide array of services primarily provided at the local level. In 2017, local government expenditures comprised 35% of the combined $15,541 spent by all levels of government per person on public goods and services.==== To fund their operations, local governments rely on local tax revenues and debt, both of which depend heavily on the existence of a stable tax base. This paper examines how extreme weather events threaten the stability of these local revenue sources and the ability of municipalities to provide essential goods and services. While recent research has highlighted the substantial social costs that natural disasters impose through federal welfare programs (Deryugina, 2017), little is known about how extreme weather events impact municipal budgets in the US context. This gap in our understanding has important distributional consequences because local public services, such as transportation, welfare assistance, and public housing, are essential for lower income households (Glaeser et al., 2008; Feler and Senses, 2017) and because local governments with large racial minority populations are more likely to be exposed to extreme weather events. Taken together, these facts highlight that the costs of climatic natural disasters are often borne by those with the greatest needs (Banzhaf et al., 2019).====We provide new evidence that hurricanes jeopardize local provision of public goods. While prior research has shown that hurricanes lead to declines in personal income (Strobl, 2010; Anttila- Hughes and Hsiang, 2013), employment (Belasen and Polachek, 2009) and property values,==== it is unclear whether such effects will lead to municipal budgetary losses. First, hurricanes may stimulate economic activity that can offset immediate fiscal shocks and even improve fiscal outcomes in the long term for local governments. Prior work shows that natural disasters can promote adoption of new capital stock (Skidmore and Toya, 2002), as well as increased demand for labor (Belasen and Polachek, 2009; Groen et al., 2016; Deryugina et al., 2018; Tran and Wilson, 2020). Second, local governments can generally rely on state reserve funds (Urahn and Irwin, 2020; Gregory, 2013) and federally-backed insurance like FEMA to pay for damages to physical property in the aftermath of a hurricane (Garrett and Sobel, 2003; del Valle et al., 2019; Masiero and Santarossa, 2020). The availability of federally-backed flood insurance to home owners through the National Flood Insurance Program could also offset negative impacts on house prices or even increase property tax revenues if hurricane disasters stimulate housing re-development (Gaul, 2019; Liao and Kousky, 2022). Third, municipalities can leverage debt instruments in absence of tax-based revenue sources to fund capital investments and infrastructure. Our analysis indicates that such levers do not, on average, offset the contracting effects of hurricane exposure on municipal budgets in the long run. We document that hurricanes increase borrowing costs at critical moments after a hurricane strike. These results imply that hurricane-induced declines in current financial resources can translate into lower future investments.====We use novel data on municipal bond default risk to show that worsening debt ratings and declines in outstanding debt are an important reason local governments are unable to recover pre- hurricane budget levels in the 10 years following hurricane exposure. Previous work shows that severe natural disasters cause sustained out-migration (Vigdor, 2008; Strobl, 2010; Deryugina et al., 2018; Billings et al., 2022; Boustan et al., 2020). Our research provides new evidence that adverse shocks to municipal finances and local populations amplify one another. This dynamic may help explain why populations do not return to areas affected by major hurricanes in their immediate aftermath. These findings, thus, highlight how natural disasters not only generate direct costs on local governments through necessitating reconstruction and assistance payments, but indirect costs by disrupting local revenue sources and increasing the cost of public debt.====Using the universe of Atlantic Basin hurricanes that made landfall in the United States between 1972 and 2017, we estimate how a municipality's budget, tax base, and debt financing evolve in the decade following exposure to hurricanes. We develop a granular hurricane exposure measure based on maximum wind speed at the level of the census tract in order to capture variation in treatment at the municipality level. In a panel fixed effects framework, we compare municipalities exposed to hurricanes against those—within the same state—that are not exposed to estimate how hurricanes affect municipal budgets. The impacts of hurricanes can vary widely across space, thus a localized exposure measure combined with municipal-level outcomes can accurately capture eco- nomic costs of hurricanes where more coarse geographic exposure measures generally underestimate such costs (Bertinelli and Strobl, 2013).====Our empirical approach exploits the random timing of hurricanes at the municipal government level. We compare municipalities within the same state that are demographically and geographically similar, but differ in hurricane exposure by chance. Because municipalities and credit rating agencies cannot accurately predict within a year's time when and where future hurricanes will strike, we are able to interpret post-hurricane changes in finances as a causal result of hurricane exposure. Our approach removes variation across municipalities with differing geographic risk, for instance coastal versus inland locations, and instead relies on the fact that local officials cannot precisely predict if a hurricane will strike before fiscal decisions are made for the next year.====Our analysis provides two key findings. First, local governments experience significant declines in aggregate revenues, expenditures, and debt in the 10 years after a hurricane strike. These declines are initially offset by intergovernmental transfers in the immediate aftermath of a hurricane but manifest significantly after 6–10 years post hurricane. Local revenue sources, including taxes and fees, fall up to 2% in the 6–10 years after exposure. The effects from major hurricanes are over twice as large as that of the average storm: we find major hurricanes reduce aggregate local revenues by 7.2% in the decade following a hurricane. The magnitude of this effect is economically large, matching the average amount taxpayers spend annually on state and local government employee payroll (Novy-Marx and Rauh, 2014).==== Local revenue declines cause subsequent declines in local public goods provision: expenditures on aggregate public works including water, sewer, trash, and public transit, decline by 3.4% in the 6-10 years after exposure. Major hurricanes cause significantly more service disruption: local public works expenditures decline 13% after exposure to a hurricane with a maximum wind speed exceeding 96 knots. The fact that aggregate expenditures decline nearly in tandem with revenues is consistent with prior work on local budgetary responses to local tax revenue shocks.====Per capita, we find smaller and less significant declines in total revenues and expenditures in the 6 to 10 years after exposure, suggesting per person service provision is unchanged. However, we find significant declines in own-source revenues per capita of 1.3% and public works expenditures per capita of 2.6%. This finding underscores that local governments have less capacity to provide goods with large fixed costs following a hurricane strike. Furthermore, municipalities become increasingly reliant on intergovernmental transfer income to maintain their per capita levels of service provision after a hurricane.====We additionally find that aggregate total debt falls by 19.2 to 25.9% in the 10 years following a major hurricane. Unlike tax-based revenue sources, the availability of debt declines immediately after hurricane exposure, and persists up to a decade thereafter. We find that part of the decline in municipal debt is caused by responses of ratings agencies. On average, Moody's Analytics— one of the three largest ratings agencies in the world—downgrades bond ratings in the aftermath of a hurricane. These downgrades translate into a 17% increase in the risk of default relative to the sample standard deviation in each of 10 years after a hurricane strike. Using a “neighboring municipality” analysis that compares hurricane exposed municipalities to neighboring municipalities that nearly miss exposure to the same disaster, we find evidence that Moody's downgrades municipal debt following hurricane strikes due to declines in local economic conditions rather than perceptions of climate risk. Our analysis on municipal debt fits into a growing body of literature that explores how natural disasters affect financial markets (for example, Lamb 1995, Ouattara and Strobl 2013, Unterberger 2018, Krueger et al. 2020, Painter 2020).==== Our paper contributes to this literature by combining granular hurricane exposure measures with local-level public finance outcomes. This exercise produces notably different conclusions from prior studies on hurricanes because we show that local-level governments suffer losses following storm exposure. We show that aggregated county or state-level analyses mask these local negative impacts.====The second key finding is that we find greater losses of revenues and public goods expenditures among local governments that historically have populations that are poorer, less educated, and contain higher shares of racial minorities. We find that a one standard deviation increase in the 1970 non-white population share exacerbates revenue declines by an additional 1.3% in the decade after a hurricane, or more than double the impact on municipalities with an average 1970 racial composition. Importantly, we find treatment effect heterogeneity across municipalities using only within-state variation, implying that regional demographic differences across municipalities in our sample cannot explain the disproportionate losses suffered by local governments that are majority nonwhite or low-income.====Most prior studies have found limited heterogeneity across demographic groups in the im- pacts of hurricanes on personal welfare outcomes (Deryugina et al., 2018; Deryugina and Molitor, 2020; Groen et al., 2020). Recent work by Billings et al. (2022) provides an important exception. They find that credit delinquency rates were higher following Hurricane Harvey among residents that were less likely to own homes relative to home owners. They also find that individuals living on blocks with more nonwhites or low-income residents were less likely to receive FEMA assistance. Because local tax revenues are tied to housing values, the unequal effects of Hurricane Harvey on individual finances documented by Billings et al. (2022) may be one mechanism driving the unequal impacts of hurricanes on local public finances documented here. Our paper provides evidence that declines in municipal budgets comprise a channel by which hurricane damages can be regressive. The disproportionate impact on municipalities with a higher proportion of low-income and minority residents is particularly concerning because these groups tend to be more reliant on public services (Betts and Fairlie, 2001; Glaeser et al., 2008) and thus more likely to be harmed by weakened municipal finances. In fact, we show that hurricane exposure serves to change the demographic composition of municipalities toward more impoverished populations. We find that hurricane exposure marginally increases local poverty rates as well as the non-white population share in the decade following exposure. These findings suggest that, while per capita revenues and expenditures do not change significantly, incumbent populations may be worse off on average following hurricane exposure because remaining residents are more likely to require public services and assistance.====Our results illuminate how disruptions in local provision of goods and services are an additional economic cost for those with the least ability to cope with natural disaster risk. Our analysis of the recent past is relevant for considering a future with more frequent and high-intensity hurricanes (Kossin et al., 2020) as we show that fiscal costs are disproportionately borne by minority and lower-income communities.====This article proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretic predictions that motivate our empirical approach. In Section 3, we discuss the construction of our data set including our localized measurement of hurricane exposure. Section 4 explains our empirical approach. We present our main results on local revenues, expenditures, default risk, and debt in Section 5. We discuss both aggregate and per capita changes following hurricane exposure. Here, we consider mechanisms driving ratings agencies to adjust bond ratings, and distinguish between mechanical destruction to local economic conditions and updates to agency perceptions of ex ante hurricane risk. In Section 6, we show how the affects of hurricanes vary by socio-economic conditions across municipalities, suggesting that the local fiscal costs of hurricanes have important distributional consequences. Section 7 shows the results of several robustness checks, including specification checks, pre-trend analyses, and sampling restrictions. Finally, Section 8 concludes.",Local public finance dynamics and hurricane shocks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022000924,28 December 2022,2022,Research Article,19.0

Large migration shocks can make visible these otherwise infra-marginal preferences. We study the effects of Hurricane Katrina-induced displacement on housing markets in receiving neighborhoods in Texas, where 1 in 5 New Orleanians relocated. Using an ==== design, we find that the relocation of 100 additional Katrina survivors to a receiving ZIP code is associated with a 2.2% ==== in relative ==== five years after the storm. This effect is driven by responses to movers from predominantly Black origin blocks. We argue that our findings are best explained by a preference for segregation on the part of incumbent White residents. In this case, racial stratification in the effect of a disaster is followed by racial stratification in economic responses.","Housing markets are characterized by household sorting along lines of race and ethnicity. Observed sorting patterns are consistent with strong underlying preferences for segregation (Trounstine, 2018), but equilibrium prices—which respond to the marginal buyer’s preferences—may mask underlying demand for segregation (Bayer et al., 2007). The arrival of new migrants can disrupt a city’s stably-sorted equilibrium, making visible latent segregationist preferences shaping housing market outcomes. In order for a flow of new arrivals to have a measurable effect, it must be (1) large, (2) disproportionately comprised of marginalized movers; and (3) plausibly exogenous to existing intra-city processes. We examine a shock that, we argue, meets all three of these criteria: the migration of large flows of movers from New Orleans to Texas cities in response to Hurricane Katrina.====Hurricane Katrina was the largest disaster-induced mass displacement in the United States since the Dust Bowl, pushing over 1 million people from their homes at least temporarily, and ultimately displacing over a quarter million (Nigg, Barnshaw, Torres, 2006, Hori, Schafer, Bowman, 2009). An estimated 250,000 of those evacuated after the storm found themselves living in Texas (Nigg et al., 2006), triggering direct changes and local responses in labor markets (McIntosh, 2008), schools (Spencer, Imberman, Kugler, Sacerdote, 2016), and other aspects of social life (Settles, Lindsay, 2011, Asad, 2015, Raker, Elliott, 2018). Evacuees were disproportionately likely to be Black—though residents of all races and ethnicities were displaced—with slower and more limited long-term return by Black versus other survivors (Paxson, Rouse, 2008, Fussell, Sastry, Vanlandingham, 2010, Sastry, Gregory, 2014). Perhaps self-evidently, the arrival of a quarter-million displaced evacuees into Texas cities did not owe to intra-city processes within those cities. Katrina survivors exercised agency in finding housing and in choosing to stay, but their arrival was catalyzed by the disaster and thus outside of the business-as-usual migration flows that are present even in stably-sorted neighborhoods.====In this paper, we examine housing price responses in neighborhoods of Texas cities that received large disaster-induced migrant flows due to Hurricane Katrina. Given the scale and composition of Katrina displacement, flows of new residents are likely to have measurable effects on neighborhood housing markets. Displaced Katrina survivors—like other internal and international migrants—often sought housing in neighborhoods where they had prior connections through family, friends, or extended networks (Weber and Peek, 2012). Flows were not only large, then, but also concentrated in a few neighborhoods across destination cities. The effects of these targeted flows of movers could broadly follow two possibilities. First, the arrival of new movers may increase demand directly by renting or purchasing homes, pushing prices up in the absence of a perfectly elastic supply.==== We do not see such an effect.====A second possibility is that house prices decline. A house’s price reflects not just its physical attributes, but also the characteristics of the neighborhood and surrounding community as well as expectations of changes to these features.==== In principle, incumbent residents in Texas cities may prefer not to live near displaced migrants from New Orleans in general. More likely, based on prior literature (Bayer, Ferreira, McMillan, 2007, Trounstine, 2018), is that this preference may be racialized, with White (or non-Black) households preferring neighborhoods segregated from Black households. While prior sorting of households may, in the long term, ensure that house prices mask such preferences (Bayer et al., 2007), the arrival of large numbers of Hurricane Katrina survivors from New Orleans—a majority-Black city—could upset these patterns and push down the willingness to pay from existing and potential residents of areas seeing large inflows.====To evaluate these different effects, we use an event-study approach to estimate the housing market effect of the arrival of Hurricane Katrina survivors in Texas neighborhoods based on longitudinal microdata on former New Orleanians. We observe a statistically significant negative association of housing prices with the number of additional survivors a neighborhood received, relative to prices in comparable neighborhoods where fewer people moved. The effect is economically significant. Our estimate implies that a neighborhood receiving 500 migrants had 12% lower house price growth from 2005 to 2010, after controlling for other observable characteristics, relative to comparable non-receiving neighborhoods. The effect is also persistent in the medium term, with relative housing prices only rebounding fully approximately ten years after Katrina.====Two additional sets of analyses offer evidence that the observed estimate represents a causal effect attributable to incumbent preferences for segregation, rather than processes like selection based on (e.g.) declining housing prices before the storm or confounding via (e.g.) effects of the Great Recession. First, we directly evaluate the response of housing prices to the arrival of additional movers from predominantly Black versus predominantly White origin census blocks. This novel contribution is made possible by the complete evacuation of New Orleans, in which nearly all residents were forced to leave in the short-term and substantial fractions of all subgroups made longer-term relocations (Sastry, Gregory, 2014, Bleemer, van der Klaauw, 2019) (in contrast with most migration flows, which are often predominantly comprised of just one subgroup). The overall negative effect is driven by movers from predominantly Black census blocks. Selection does not appear to drive our main result: we see no negative pre-trend in neighborhoods receiving migrants from predominantly Black blocks. In contrast, the negative effect largely disappears for neighborhoods receiving in-movers from predominantly White blocks in New Orleans.====Second, we examine heterogeneity in housing price responses based on the racial makeup of the destination neighborhood prior to Hurricane Katrina to rule out the Great Recession as a potential confounder driving our results. If Katrina migrants moved to neighborhoods with subprime lending booms, we would expect the largest effects in neighborhoods with relatively few White residents (Mian and Sufi, 2009). We do not see evidence of a disproportionate decline in neighborhoods that already had more people of color.====Highly concentrated short-term shocks that disproportionately displace minoritized communities, our work shows, can lead to large housing price effects in destination neighborhoods. Our evidence suggests that the most likely candidate for declining house prices in neighborhoods with large inflows of Katrina survivors is a preference for segregation on the part of incumbent residents. These findings are consistent with an established body of literature showing the role of racial sorting in shaping housing price responses to migration (Schelling, 1971, Boustan, 2010, Saiz, Wachter, 2011), but our work is novel in showing how re-sorting can emerge in response to a large external shock. A single extreme weather event, we show, can lead to economically meaningful housing market effects even in far-flung destination cities. Such events are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change (Patricola, Wehner, 2018, Irish, Sleath, Cialone, Knutson, Jensen, 2014)—leading to the predicted displacement of tens of millions, disproportionately from minoritized communities (Lustgarten, 2020). The interplay between disaster displacement and housing market sorting is thus a topic of considerable importance.",The Effect of Racial Composition on Neighborhood Housing Prices: Evidence from Hurricane Katrina-Induced Migration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022000912,16 December 2022,2022,Research Article,20.0

Moreover, mobility of renters living in rent-controlled units decreased. [91 words]","Regulators frequently intervene in the price mechanism of markets, for example in form of minimum wages or price controls for fuels, agricultural products, and pharmaceuticals. In particular, housing markets are many times subject to rent controls, often accompanied by long-standing, emotional debates amongst scholars and policymakers, centered on distributional issues. If not at the national level, rent controls exist at the local level in many countries, e.g., in the United States. Nearly every textbook on housing and real estate economics covers this topic (see, e.g. McDonald, McMillen, 2010, O’Sullivan, Irwin, 2007). Affordable housing is also a major issue in election campaigns. For example, in 1948, U.S. President Harry S. Truman won the White House by campaigning for the ====, which included a promise to resolve housing shortages (Von Hoffman, 2000). Even in recent years, affordable housing remains a vibrantly discussed topic: In light of sharply increasing rents in urban areas in Germany, the Social Democrats succeeded in launching a debate around the need for stricter rent controls in the 2013 German Bundestag elections (Knaup et al., 2013) and eventually managed to introduce rent controls 2015. In the 2021 Bundestag election campaign, several parties – including the Social Democrats – advocate tighter rent control measures. In the UK, increases in rents and rising shares of privately owned rental housing fuel the ongoing debate on rent control (Wilson, 2017), and housing played a major role in the 2015 UK general elections (Kelly, 2015). Inspired by the German rent control regime, Lille and Paris==== (France) introduced similar regulations in 2014 and 2015, and in May 2019, the government of Catalonia (Spain) proposed to introduce a literal copy of German 2015 rent control regulations, although the law never came into force.====In this paper, we study market segmentation that arises from the introduction of a price ceiling in the market for rental housing in Germany in 2015. This policy intervention can be considered to be a poster-child of so-called “second-generation rent control”.==== The regulation establishes a rent ceiling only for a part of the market, leaving the price mechanism in the rest intact. Moreover, in contrast to other rent control policies studied previously, the German rent cap is a pure price control. It did not impose other constraints on landlords that could also influence landlord or renter behavior. This puts us in the unique position to study important theoretical mechanisms triggered by the introduction of a price cap. As such, the German rent control policy represents an excellent test-case to empirically evaluate the causal effects of rent control on regulated and free-market rents, housing service consumption, and housing supply.====We base our empirical analysis on a standard comparative-static model of a divided (controlled/free) housing market (see, e.g. McDonald, McMillen, 2010, Skak, Bloze, 2013). We formalize and generalize the graphical representation to establish that an increase in free-market rents in response to rent control may indicate misallocation of households to housing units. Furthermore, the size of the welfare loss related to misallocation increases with the strength of the spillover. The mechanism is as follows: Rent control allows some households, which otherwise would have been unwilling to rent a unit in the market, to compete for rent-controlled units, thereby replacing other households with stronger preferences for living in the rent-controlled market. These latter households either have to leave the local market, or they have to move to the free-market segment, which pushes up the free-market rental price. As an alternative explanation, a reduction of the rent-controlled housing stock may also push up free-market prices.====For a number of reasons, many economists oppose rent regulations.==== This paper sheds light on two important aspects from the economic debate revolving around price controls in general and the effects of rent controls specifically.====First, we contribute to the small, but growing literature that analyzes the causal effects of rent controls. In a recent paper, Diamond et al. (2019) finds that tenancy rent control reduces household mobility and the size of the rental housing stock, and leads to city-wide increases of rents. Results from Sims (2007) and Autor et al. (2014) point in the direction that there is only a small effect of rent control on construction activity, but a shift of dwellings from rental to owner-occupied status and a deterioration in the quality of existing rental units (Sims, 2007). Moreover, the impact on the price of the non-controlled housing stock is negative and substantial (Autor et al., 2014).==== Spillovers from the regulated part of the market to other parts work through various channels. Autor et al. (2014) propose two channels that may give rise to these same-sign spillovers: externalities through (i) higher maintenance and (ii) spatial sorting by income. The analysis of the 25 years lasting Cambridge rent control suggests that the maintenance and household sorting channels dominate in the long-run. In contrast, we isolate an opposite-sign spillover effect. Arguably, our short-run perspective allows us to shut down the more inert maintenance and sorting channels, and it minimizes the (negative) response of the supply of rental housing (as in Diamond et al., 2019). Moreover, the paper provides first evidence on the effects of rent control in a European housing market with a high share of rental housing.====Second, based on an excellent housing market example, we provide quasi-experi-mental evidence on the distorting effects of price controls on the allocation of goods (Glaeser, Luttmer, 2003, Davis, Kilian, 2011, Wang, 2011). Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) argue that traditional welfare analysis often ignores welfare losses from misallocation, i.e., from the allocation of goods to buyers who do not value these goods the most. So far, the literature on price controls focuses mainly on quantity responses, e.g., in the labor market in response to minimum wages (Card, Krueger, 1994, Stewart, 2004, Dube, Lester, Reich, 2010, Dube, Lester, Reich, 2016, Monras, 2019), a point noted already by Glaeser and Luttmer (2003). We demonstrate theoretically that market segmentation—induced by price regulation—may cause substantial misallocation. Moreover, we document empirically that the observed spillover to free-market rents is likely a consequence of misallocation, and we provide evidence discounting plausible alternative explanations for the spillover.====Quasi-experimental evidence for misallocation remains scarce, particularly in housing market context. The findings of Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) and Skak and Bloze (2013) are based on cross-sectional variation between regulated and free local markets, requiring relatively strong, non-testable assumptions for identification. For example, there may be income-based sorting into locations with and without rent control, and between controlled and free-market segments in the same location (Autor et al., 2014). Housing demand and rental housing supply may also differ between locations for reasons that are not captured by the data. In such settings, it is hard to disentangle misallocation from other determinants of housing services consumption.====This paper considers a particular form of misallocation: the displacement of incumbent residents from the local housing market due to the introduction of a partial rent control. This form of displacement is inefficient in a world where residents have idiosyncratic location preferences for the local market that may capture many different things such as family ties or the match between specialized skills and the local industry structure. It does not require heterogeneity in housing units within the controlled part of the market, nor across the controlled and free segments of the local housing market. While this form of misallocation is discussed theoretically for first-generation rent controls in Glaeser and Luttmer (2003), empirical evidence is lacking. The paper is the first to establish a causal link between rent regulation and this form of misallocation.====We exploit the spatial, temporal, and within-market variation generated by the law to identify the effects of the regulation, employing both an event study and a difference-in-differences strategy. In the analysis, we focus on three aspects: First, we analyze the impact of the rent cap on regulated and unregulated rents within a housing market. We focus on the short-run effects and find that regulated rents decreased immediately after the rent cap became effective, while rents in the free-market segment ==== after a lag of one to two months. Second, we assess the demand responses to the regulation. We analyze how households adjusted housing service consumption (conditional on their incomes), and we investigate changes in renter mobility within, out of, and into the regulated local market. Misallocation may manifest itself in both of these dimensions. Lower prices may induce households to consume more housing services, and lower prices may affect moving decisions by changing the relative attractiveness of different housing choices. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) to investigate this. The results are consistent with the misallocation hypothesis. We find no indication that housing expenditure shares of recent movers into rent-controlled units decreased – despite the lower rental prices –, and we document reduced mobility out of the regulated market. Third, we focus on the supply side effects of the rent cap. We do not find evidence for negative short-run impacts on rental housing supply in the regulated segment, thereby discounting alternative explanations for the estimated spillover. Our analysis further reveals that a larger number of small residential buildings were demolished in 2016 in order to be replaced with a new residential building. In an accompanying study (Mense et al., 2019), we find evidence that prices for building lots increased in regulated markets. Both findings are consistent with positive revenue expectations for new, unregulated residential buildings. Finally, the numbers of housing units built in 2016 or 2017 were not affected significantly.====Our results are important for the following reasons. First, price controls are ubiquitous in housing markets. They typically only apply to part of the market. We provide clean evidence on the rent spillover to the uncontrolled segment that is triggered by such market interventions. Second, we extend the analysis in Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) to partly controlled markets and provide a complenetary angle on the misallocation mechanism induced by rent control. While Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) focus on misallocation of renters to different housing units within the controlled local housing market, the misallocation mechanism studied in this paper works through the displacement of renters from the controlled segment. Third, we provide evidence on the short-run supply response to the rent cap. The spillover to free-market rents represents an incentive for developers to demolish old units and to build new rental housing. This channel has not been considered in previous work, but it likely affects the future size of the rent-controlled stock, the uncontrolled segment, and the overall size of the local rental market—working in opposition directions as other channels documented by the literature.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In the next section, we present a simple theoretical framework that helps to interpret the effect of rent control on free-market rents. Then, we outline the institutional background and stylized facts regarding recent developments in the German housing market in Section 3. In Section 4, we present our empirical strategy and the results. In the final section, we discuss our findings.","Rent Control, Market Segmentation, and Misallocation: Causal Evidence from a Large-Scale Policy Intervention",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022000894,15 December 2022,2022,Research Article,21.0

We compare “treated” restaurants facing a nearby entrant to “control” restaurants with no new competition, matching restaurants using location characteristics and a pairwise distance measure based on menu text. Restaurants frequently adjust prices and product offerings but we find no evidence that they respond differentially to new competition. However, restaurants in locations with an entrant count in the top decile—areas with many new competitors—are 22% more likely to exit after a year than restaurants in the lowest entry decile.","Firms in many industries compete in markets with a large number of competitors and substantial product differentiation. To study these markets, many papers in trade, urban economics, and other fields use models of monopolistic competition, especially the Dixit–Stiglitz constant elasticity of substitution (CES) model Dixit and Stiglitz (1977). In these models competition is aspatial or global: each firm makes decisions only in response to market aggregates, there is no strategic competition between individual firms, and no two firms are closer in geographic or product space than any other pair. An alternative approach uses spatial competition models (e.g. Salop, 1979) to describe markets with differentiated products. In these models competition is spatial or local: firms compete strategically but with only a small subset of close competitors. These two approaches, aspatial and spatial, are both commonly used and yet they imply very different answers to a fundamental question: how does a firm respond to new competition in markets with many differentiated competitors?====In this paper we study the responses of incumbent restaurants to competition from new entrants. When firms have differentiated products they may compete for customers in multiple dimensions; a close competitor could be a firm located a few blocks away, a firm with a similar product, or both. Unless researchers have detailed product information, it can be difficult to infer which firms are likely competitors and to measure competitive responses that may be spread across many products. We use a novel panel of restaurant menus in New York City to measure responses to competition in both geographic space and product space. We collected menus from Grubhub, a large online food delivery service, every week for 68 consecutive weeks, giving us a panel of about 550,000 menus from 11,700 unique restaurants. We then used separate data from New York City restaurant inspections and Yelp reviews to identify 1500 entrants over this period. These datasets allows us to precisely define the distance between competitors in arguably the most salient aspects of restaurant product differentiation, location and menu, and to measure competitive responses over a firm’s full set of products. We are also able to assess competition along several other margins, such as quality ratings and hours of operation, and to examine the effect of new firm entry on the likelihood of incumbent firm exit.====The restaurant industry—with many firms, substantial product differentiation, and low barriers to entry–is perhaps the canonical example of monopolistic competition.==== This industry also provides a simple and intuitive context for comparing the implications of aspatial and spatial models. If a new restaurant opens on the same block as an existing restaurant, or opens nearby with a similar menu, how does the existing restaurant respond? Do they lower prices or change their menu items, or is the market so large and competition so diffuse that they can ignore this new local competitor? In addition to being a good test case for theoretical models of competition, the restaurant industry is economically important. As one of the largest employers of minimum wage labor, the competitiveness of this industry has direct implications for the effects of increases in the minimum wage.==== Moreover, recent work suggests restaurants may be a critical amenity driving central city growth Couture and Handbury (2020).====A challenge in studying the response to entry is that firm location choice is endogenous. In our context, an entering restaurant may choose a specific site because of attractive location characteristics, or because none of the incumbent restaurants offer a similar menu. If the unobserved determinants of location choice are correlated with factors affecting the measured outcomes of the incumbents, then this introduces selection bias. For example, if new entrants tend to move into areas with rapidly increasing incomes and commercial rents, then incumbent restaurants may be raising prices independent of entry, thus biasing upwards estimates of the response to competition. A related issue is that independent of competition, menu changes may differ systematically across different types of restaurants. If entry frequency is correlated with restaurant characteristics—and we present evidence that it is—then this may also lead to bias. For instance, if high end sushi restaurants tend to locate in areas with lots of entry, then we might mistakenly attribute menu changes from an increase in the price of tuna to competition from new restaurants. Lastly, the incumbent response to entry may be a function of characteristics of both the incumbent and the entrant: the same Italian restaurant could respond differently to the entry of a new sushi restaurant versus a new Italian restaurant.====Given the frequent entry and large number of firms in the New York City restaurant market, in most of our analysis we examine outcomes within very small sub-markets—our baseline analysis uses a radius of 500 m around an incumbent restaurant—and over short durations of 8, 12, and 16 weeks. At these levels of granularity in geography and time it is difficult to find cost shocks or other instruments for entry; in fact, little data of any kind is available at these scales. Therefore, to address the endogeneity issues above, we instead use a matching technique that exploits the unusual degree of product information in our dataset. We match “treated” incumbent restaurants facing competition from a new entrant with a “control” group of incumbent restaurants that have similar menus and are sited in locations with equal entry frequency, but in that period faced no changes to the competitive environment. The intuition for our identification strategy is that restaurant location choice across these small sub-markets and within these limited durations is unlikely to be completely deterministic. Many factors affect restaurant site decisions including zoning, rent, square footage, the existence of previous restaurant infrastructure (cooking equipment, ventilation, plumbing, restrooms–all of which can affect startup costs), utility costs, and lease lengths, see discussion in Robson (2011). Further, location options are limited; 2017 retail vacancy rates for the five boroughs range from 2.9% to 4.1% Marcus & Millichap (2017). Therefore the central assumption for our matching approach is that for two similar restaurants in two sub-markets, which market receives entry in a given short duration is essentially random. Note that variation in entry times is a crucial part of this strategy: over different periods of our data the same restaurant can serve as both a treated and control observation.====A key challenge in implementing this matching technique is how to determine the product similarity of two restaurants from the text of their menus. We employ a text processing technique from computer science called “cosine similarity” to calculate a scalar measure of the similarity of two restaurant menus, and use this as a metric for distance in product space. We compare this measure with a set of observable restaurant characteristics and find that it is a strong predictor of pairwise similarity in restaurants’ product features. Using this measure and additional location characteristics, we compile a set of treated and control observations and examine incumbent responses to entry in a number of channels and settings. We also use this measure to define treatment in terms of menu similarity, and thus an important contribution of our paper is to provide systematic evidence on spatial competition in two different dimensions.====Our results suggest that restaurants facing competition from a new entrant do ==== change their prices, products, or service differently from restaurants without new competition. We find no competitive response across different quantiles of restaurant prices, nor do we find a response at the item level, which controls for menu composition changes. Our results also show that restaurants are neither adding nor removing items in response to entry. Further, we find no evidence of restaurants responding along other margins, including food, order, or delivery quality, cuisine designations, or hours of operation. Our findings are consistent across a battery of specifications, including cases where the entrant’s menu is very similar to those of the incumbents, and where there are relatively few incumbent restaurants, making an additional restaurant a larger competitive shock. However, we do find a causal relationship between high intensity of nearby entry and a higher rate of exit, which suggests that competition does affect firm profit. Our data is not sufficient to estimate consumer preferences and validate one particular model of competition, but our results provide support for the weak strategic interaction assumption of aspatial monopolistic competition models, and are relevant for a variety of related subjects, including retail competition, firm clustering, and location choice.====This surprising result of no competitive response is consistent with a recent theoretical paper by Gabaix et al. (2016) showing that mark-ups in random utility models of monopolistic competition are often minimally affected by additional competition in markets with many competitors. In a different context, Arcidiacono et al. (2020), find that Walmart’s entry into a market has no effect on the prices of incumbent grocers, despite causing a 16% decline in revenue. Nonetheless, the restaurant industry is notoriously competitive and prices may be sticky (“menu costs”); it is natural to wonder if restaurants have the capacity to adjust menus in response to entry.==== In our sample restaurants change their menus with high frequency: the median duration between price changes is two weeks. Therefore it is worth emphasizing that our results show frequent menu changes but no ==== change in response to entry.====While our dataset allows us to observe detailed firm behavior, it also has several limitations. One limitation is that we only observe online menus and cannot observe changes to dine-in menus, if these differ from online menus, or changes to dine-in service (e.g., interior space improvements). A second limitation is that not all restaurants are on the Grubhub delivery platform and it is possible that those on Grubhub compete differently from those that are not, a selection issue. A third limitation is that we only observe restaurants in a single large city. We discuss the implications of these limitations in Section 7.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we discuss differences between spatial and aspatial competition in a conceptual framework to illustrate our empirical strategy, and then briefly review the empirical literature on imperfect competition in differentiated markets. Next, we describe our data, provide a definition of new competition, and present descriptive statistics. After, we discuss the potential endogeneity in our estimation and our implementation of a matching strategy to account for this. The strategy includes the construction of a measure of product distance from our menu data, which we denote “menu distance.” In Section 4 we present our main results on the causal response to entry in geographic space, evaluate the robustness of these findings, and examine potential heterogeneity. As an extension, we try an alternative identification strategy based on distance to the entrant, rather than matching. In Section 5 we estimate the response to entry in product (menu) space. Lastly, we estimate the effect of entry intensity on the likelihood of incumbent restaurant exit.

How do local pollutants affect child health?==== Does living within walking distance to a new transit stop improve labor market outcomes?==== How far do neighborhood shocks, such as foreclosures or new construction spread?==== A standard method of evaluating the effects of the treatment is to compare changes in outcomes for units that are close to treatment to those slightly further away – what I label the ‘ring method’ as illustrated in Fig. 1. This paper formalizes the assumptions required for identification in the ring method, highlighting potential pitfalls of the currently-used estimator, and proposes an improved estimator.====First, I formalize the necessary assumptions for unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect on the affected units.==== The first assumption is the well understood parallel trends assumption for the treated and control units. This requires that the ==== change in (counterfactual) untreated outcomes in the treated ring is equal to the ==== change in the control ring. The rings method is typically motivated by the fact that since the treated and control units are all very close in physical location, e.g. having access to the same labor market and consumptive amenities, shocks over time should be common across units in the neighborhood.====Instead of ==== leveraging the common neighborhood trends assumption that motivates the ring method, researchers rely on a second assumption which requires correct identification of how far treatment effects are experienced (the inner ring). This is a very strict assumption that when not satisfied, causes biased estimates of the treatment effect. If the treated ring is too narrow, then units in the control ring experience effects of treatment and the change among ‘control’ units no longer identifies the counterfactual trend. On the other hand, if the treated ring is too wide, then the zero treatment effect of some unaffected units are averaged into the change among ‘treated’ units. Therefore, results will be attenuated towards zero.====I propose an alternative estimator that fully leverages the ‘common neighborhood trends’ assumption using a nonparametric partitioning-based least square estimator (Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell, Feng, Cattaneo, Farrell, Feng). My proposed methodology estimates the treatment effect curve as a function of distance by using many rings rather than trying to estimate the average treatment effect with one inner ring. This method requires that treatment effects become zero somewhere between the distance of 0 and the outer ring ==== the need to specify the ==== distance at which it does. To do this, the estimator leverages the stronger ‘common neighborhood trends’ assumption that the counterfactual trend is constant across distance. This new assumption is more strict in that the standard method only requires that parallel trends holds ==== in each ring. However, researchers typically motivate the identification strategy by saying within a small distance from treatment that units are subject to a common set of shocks which implies the more strict assumption. While this assumption is not directly testable, my proposed estimator creates a set of point estimates of treatment effects that can be used to visually inspect the plausibility of the assumption. If after some distance, ‘treatment effects’ become centered at zero, this suggests that common trends hold, akin to the pre-trends test in event study regressions.====The nonparametric estimator provides many benefits. First, the estimator allows the researcher to get a more complete picture of how the intervention affects units at various distances rather than estimating an “overall effect”. For example, a new bus-stop potentially creates net costs to immediate neighbors while providing net benefits for homes slightly further away. Estimation of the treatment effect curve can illustrate these different effects that a single ring may average out to near-zero effects. Additionally, the proposed nonparametric estimator selects the rings in a ==== removing incentives for specification searching or ‘pre-testing’ the data to determine the ‘correct’ rings (McCloskey, Michaillat, Andrews, Kasy, 2019).====This paper contributes to the literature in many ways. First, I contribute to a literature that discuss identification using the rings method. Sullivan (2017) and Gerardi et al. (2015) discuss the identification assumption of identifying the maximum treatment distance. My paper formalizes all the necessary assumptions for identification in the ring method. Other researchers have recognized that estimating a single average treatment effect is less informative than a treatment effect curve, instead using multiple rings to estimate treatment effects at different distances (e.g. Alexander, Currie, Schnell, 2019, Casey, Schiman, Wachala, 2018, Di Tella, Schargrodsky, 2004). However, this approach selects multiple rings in an ad-hoc manner, requires treatment effects to become zero after the outer-most treatment ring, and is prone to problems of specification searching. The current study’s proposed estimator selects the number and location of rings in a data-driven way and does not require correct specification of where treatment effects become zero.====Diamond and McQuade (2019) propose an alternative nonparametric estimator aimed at estimating a treatment effect surface. Similar to this paper, they leverage the “common local trends” assumption to estimate a ==== treatment effect curve. Their procedure allows “location” fixed effects to differ along two-dimensions, latitude and longitude (e.g. the mean home price is higher in the north-west than the south-east) which in cross-sectional data can absorb more variation in the data yielding smaller standard errors than my method, though both are consistent. In the case of panel data, this does not matter since first-differencing removes this systematic variation. To produce noise estimates/standard errors, their method requires integrating over the 2D curve for arbitrarily chosen rings. In cases where researchers chose these aggregation ranges based on the results of the estimation procedure, standard inference tools are not valid even when bootstrapping the standard errors (Leeb and Ptscher, 2005). As discussed above, my proposed estimator provides valid inference after selection of aggregation regions and choses these aggregation regions in a data-driven manner.====This paper also contributes to a small literature on difference-in-differences estimators from a spatial lens (Butts, Clarke, 2017, Berg, Streitz, Verbitsky-Savitz, Raudenbush, 2012, Delgado, Florax, 2015). These papers address instances where treatment is well defined by administrative boundaries but spillovers cause problems of defining who is ‘treated’ and at what level of exposure. This paper contributes to this literature by considering the setting where treatment occurs at a point in space. Butts (2021) and Clarke (2017) both recommend a method of using many rings to estimate a treatment effect curve, but are not able to provide a data-driven way to select the rings. Since this paper focuses on local shocks where constant parallel trends are plausible, I am able to provide a data-driven approach to choosing rings.",JUE Insight: Difference-in-differences with geocoded microdata,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022000705,6 August 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

We propose a new approach to this challenge. For single-peaked wage distributions, if individuals left of the mode disproportionately select out of large city labor markets, the CDF evaluated at the mode shrinks as city size increases. Among college trained, white full-time US workers, evidence of selection is present even after conditioning on extensive observable attributes. Among individuals with a high school degree or less, selection is absent. Additional estimates indicate that for college trained workers, 3.5% is an upper bound on the modal worker's wage elasticity with respect to city size. For those with limited education we can be more precise: modal wage elasticity is 3.9% for men and 5.2% for married women.","Despite broad consensus that cities enhance productivity (see Rosenthal and Strange (2004, 2020) and Combes and Gobillon (2015) for reviews), the magnitude of this effect is difficult to confirm because unusually skilled workers may select into large city labor markets.==== Motivated by==== studies that draw on the shape of factor return distributions for identification (e.g. Saez, 2010; Combes et al, 2012; Eeckhout, Pinheiro and Schmidheiny, 2014; Kleven, 2016; Jales and Yu, 2017; and Jales 2018), we propose a new approach to test for whether selection is present and to estimate the effect of city size on a typical worker's wage. We show that for single-peaked wage distributions with a well-defined interior mode, if workers left of the mode disproportionately drop out of large city labor markets the CDF evaluated at the mode will shrink as city size increases, and sensitivity of modal wage to selection diminishes as the mode becomes more prominently shaped.====We highlight four populations in the U.S. that are likely to differ in their sensitivity to selection because of differences in labor force participation and mobility across MSAs.==== These include married women with a college degree or more, married women with a high school degree or less, and analogous samples for men (grouping married and single individuals together). For prime age individuals, labor supply is elastic for married women but inelastic for men (e.g. Heim, 2007; Blau and Kahn, 2007). Highly educated individuals may also be more willing to relocate across MSAs (e.g. Molloy et al, 2011; Balgova, 2022), in part because they are more likely to benefit from skill bias in large city labor markets that has become more prominent in recent decades (e.g. Autor, 2019). These mechanisms suggest that selection is most likely to be present for married college educated women and least relevant for men with limited education, priors that we consider empirically.====Throughout, our focus is on the effect of unobserved factors that affect wage as it is unobservables that drive concern about selection. Using individual level data from the 2000 U.S. census, we begin by creating relatively homogeneous samples with observations restricted to full-time working individuals, age 25-55, who are white, non-Hispanic and native born. For each of our four samples, log wage is regressed on age fixed effects, occupation fixed effects, industry fixed effects, years of schooling fixed effects (for the high school or less samples) and marital status (for men). The residuals from these regressions capture unobserved factors that affect wage and are used in all of the analysis that follows. To facilitate comparison of summary statistics across our four samples, we add the sample-specific raw log wage mean values to the residuals. This preserves sample means but has no effect on our primary estimates because the variance and shapes of the residual distributions are driven entirely by unobservables. Formed as above, the adjusted residuals are sometimes referred to as conditional wage or simply wage.====For each of our four samples, the conditional wage distributions are single peaked with prominent interior modes in small (less than 1 million) and large (more than 2.5 million) urban areas. This is evident in Fig. 1 which displays density plots having converted the log wage measures to wage levels. Plots are in separate panels for the four demographic groups highlighted above, each of which includes a separate density for small and large MSAs. If the underlying latent densities were not single peaked, then selection would be the primary driver of the single peaked shape of the densities in the figure. Although we cannot rule out that possibility – latent densities are unobserved – the pronounced interior mode for each of the densities in Fig. 1 suggests that the underlying latent densities are similarly shaped.====Bearing this in mind, in the simplest case, if only workers to the left of the mode drop out of large city labor markets, the mode does not shift. In more general cases, selection extends to the right of the mode. In that instance, for a linear, monotonic selection process, elasticity conditions developed later in the paper determine the extent of modal shift. Moreover, that shift shrinks to zero as the mode becomes increasingly sharp (as with a Laplace distribution). These principles point to three complementary regressions that we estimate. The first regresses the CDF of modal wage in the city on log city size. This regression serves as a diagnostic tool to discern whether selection is present. The second and third regressions replace the dependent variable with log modal wage in the city and log mean wage in the city, respectively. These regressions shed further light on how the mode can be used to evaluate the effect of city size on worker wage.====Results from the CDF regressions yield compelling evidence that among college trained workers, including both married women and men, selection contributes to higher wages in larger cities. Among individuals with a high school degree or less, evidence of selection is absent. These patterns are broadly consistent with our priors. They also echo patterns highlighted by Autor (2019). Autor documents the increase in skill bias in large U.S. cities in the last several decades, with a growing role for college trained, knowledge-oriented workers. He also shows that the nature of work for noncollege workers has shifted dramatically in large cities, becoming increasingly similar to work performed in small cities, and more reliant on generic as opposed to differentiated skill. These trends may be contributing to differences in selection that we estimate for college and noncollege workers.====Estimates from the mode and mean wage regressions are also revealing. For college educated workers, the elasticity of modal wage with respect to MSA size is roughly 3.5% for both married women and for men. Having confirmed that selection is present in both samples, that estimate should be interpreted as an upper bound on the effect of MSA size on wage for the typical (modal) worker.====For these same two samples, estimates based on log mean wage in an MSA are notably higher. The estimates are 5.78% and 5.47% for college educated married women and for men, respectively. The larger elasticities for mean wage could arise from two sources. One is selection. Given evidence of strongly single-peaked distributions with interior modes (in Fig. 1), selection likely pulls the mean up relative to the mode. A second mechanism is dilation which would occur if high performing individuals based on unobserved factors derive greater productivity boosts from operating in a larger MSA (e.g. Combes et al, 2012; Gaubert, 2018). This would also pull mean wage up relative to modal wage. Although we cannot confirm whether dilation is present in these samples (for reasons described later), our estimates suggest that selection is contributing to the spread between mode and mean wage effects.====The pattern for those with a high school degree or less is different. As noted above, for this group, evidence of selection is absent, both for married women and for men. The estimated elasticities of modal and mean wage with respect to MSA size are also quite similar, 5.23% and 5.26% respectively for married women and 3.94% and 4.00% for men.==== We show later that absence of selection effects and similar estimates of the wage elasticities at the mode and mean implies that dilation is not present. This allows us to be more definitive about city size effects: among workers with limited education, an approximate doubling of city size increases wage for the typical (modal) married woman by roughly 5% and among men by roughly 4%.====At face value, the wage elasticities above suggest that the urban premium for a modal noncollege worker is higher than for a modal college trained individual. This does not, however, necessarily indicate that workers with limited education derive a greater productivity boost from city size. Instead, as suggested by Autor (2019), if noncollege individuals are not notably more productive in large cities, they may require compensation to remain in large urban markets where they serve as complements to college trained workers. This is because large cities tend to be expensive.====Using the mode as above has limitations. Most prominently there must be a prior that the underlying latent density is single peaked with a well-defined interior mode. This is consistent with Fig. 1 and characteristic of considerable economic data. The modal individual or group must also be informative. For symmetric distributions, the mode is the same as the mean and the median. More generally, the mode represents the most common occurrence. In politics, this could sometimes be a candidate's “base” whose support is needed to secure a majority. In education, resource constrained schools may skew teaching and related opportunities towards students with more typical (modal) attributes. In such instances where the most common individual matters for policy or behavior, the mode will tend to be of intrinsic interest.====Several alternate approaches have been used to address possible selection of unusually skilled workers into larger cities, each with advantages and challenges. Eckert et al (2022), De la Roca (2017), De la Roca and Puga (2017), and Glaeser and Mare (2001) use large individual-level panel data files for Denmark, Spain, and the U.S., each of which allows the authors to control for person fixed effects and model movement into and away from large cities. Person fixed effects do much to capture unobserved skill of an individual, but this approach is not possible for widely accessible cross-sectional data. Pseudo-random experiments have also been used to help identify causal effects. Eckert et al (2022) document outcomes for refugees randomly assigned to different cities in Denmark; Ahlfeldt et al (2015) consider changes after the Berlin Wall came down, and Greenstone et al (2010) compare outcomes in locations selected by major companies as compared to runner-up locations that were nearly chosen. Pseudo random events are not always available, however, and are often idiosyncratic in ways that may limit generalization to other settings.

Instrument validity must still be defended, however, and instrument variation may not be sufficient in some locations (e.g. landslide hazard is similar throughout much of the U.S. Midwest). Gaubert (2018), Ahlfeldt et al (2015) and Baum-Snow and Pavan (2012) use structural methods to estimate productivity gains from agglomeration and proximity. These papers stand out for their successful integration of economic theory with estimation. Applying structural methods, however, is not straightforward as it requires careful balancing of parsimony that is needed to make the models tractable with enough generality to allow for robustness.====Different from the strategies above, our use of the mode is most similar to the approach adopted by Combes et al (2012), which is among the few studies in the agglomeration literature to draw on the shape of the factor return distribution.==== Combes et al (2012) divide French cities into those below versus those above median size. Focusing mostly on manufacturing plants, they minimize mean squared deviations between TFP quantiles for plants organized into the two groups of cities. Their model is designed in a manner that identifies parameters of the underlying city size productivity function, including a shift factor and dilation, in addition to a TFP threshold value below which companies select out of large city markets. An appealing feature of the Combes et al (2012) model is that it does not impose any structure on the underlying latent productivity distribution although it does embed a particular selection process in the estimation routine which makes their estimates potentially sensitive to departures from that structure. While our model based on the mode is not as general, it can be easily implemented for cross-sectional datasets, drawing on variation across many locations. This makes the mode an accessible diagnostic tool to test for the presence of selection when using cross-sectional data, and in some instances, a straightforward way to estimate the effect of city size.",JUE Insight: Using the mode to test for selection in city size wage premia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022000687,2 August 2022,2022,Research Article,25.0

To our knowledge, this is the first paper to fill in the gap and study the effect of COVID-19 on both the horizontal and vertical price gradients.====Using unit-level housing transactions from the largest online real estate agency in China, we analyze the impact of the pandemic on housing prices, and on the horizontal and vertical housing price gradients.

COVID-19 also changed both the horizontal and vertical housing price gradients. Results suggest that COVID-19 flattened the housing price gradient with respect to distance, as the prices of apartments closer to city centers experienced greater decreases. The virus has also affected the preference over vertical densities measured by building heights and floor levels within buildings, even after controlling for the changes in the horizontal price gradient. Specifically, we find that apartments in taller residential buildings suffered from a greater price decline during the pandemic and housing prices of apartments on higher floors experienced larger increases compared to those on lower floors.

Focusing on electricity, I find a 7.9% increase in residential consumption, and a 6.9% and 8.0% reduction in commercial and industrial usage, respectively, from a monthly panel of electric utilities. Natural gas consumption also shifted toward residential use, so that aggregate electricity and gas expenditure only fell by 1% on net during a period in which GDP fell by 5%. Hourly smart meter data from Texas reveal how daily routines changed during the pandemic, with residential electricity usage during weekdays closely resembling those of weekends. In total, residential energy expenditures were an estimated $13B higher during Q2-Q4 2020, with the largest increases occurring in areas with a greater propensity to work from home. I find that transportation fuel consumption declined about 16%, so that total energy consumption in the U.S. economy fell by 8%.","This paper estimates how energy consumption has changed in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on electricity. Accompanying the public health crisis has been a major economic shock—one that has affected both the level and composition of economic activity. The reduction in economic activity is clear in patterns of energy use in transportation, industry, and commercial businesses, while there has been a striking shift towards greater residential usage.====To reduce the risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, roughly one-third of the American labor force has been working from home (Bick, Blandin, Mertens, Brynjolfsson, Horton, Ozimek, Rock, Sharma, TuYe, Dingel, Neiman, 2020). Household expenditures also changed dramatically, reflecting both the loss of income and consumption opportunities, and a shift toward household production (Baker, Farrokhnia, Meyer, Pagel, Yannelis, Cox, Ganong, Noel, Vavra, Wong, Farrell, Greig, 2020). Whether under government orders to shelter-in-place, working remotely, or out of work and school, people are spending an inordinate amount of time at home (Chetty et al., 2020). Additional time and consumption at home requires significant increases in energy use. This represents an additional and essential expense at a time when many households are also experiencing severe economic hardship. On the other hand, the savings from reduced commuting in both time and energy are substantial (Barrero et al., 2020).====The COVID-19 economic shock is therefore unusual in the way it has shifted economic activity from workplaces to homes. Recent surveys find that U.S. employees are anticipating expanded work from home (WFH) opportunities post-pandemic (Bartik, Cullen, Glaeser, Luca, Stanton, Barrero, Bloom, Davis), up to 20% of working hours from 5% pre-pandemic. What are the implications of such a shift on energy usage? The energy consumption of a city based on in-person work is structured around transportation to an urban core, where co-location permits the economical use of energy for heating, cooling, lighting, food service, etc. Thermostats in residences are turned down as commercial buildings are filled with workers, and cafeterias substitute for individually pre-heated ovens and open refrigerators. With a WFH posture, transportation plays a more limited role in the city’s energy use profile, and co-location commands less of a premium. Energy consumption during the day shifts from businesses to homes, and the efficiency achieved through density falls, as space gains importance over proximity (Glaeser, Kahn, 2010, Glaeser, 2011).====I measure changes in energy consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), with varying degrees of spatial and temporal resolution, depending upon availability. For electricity, I evaluate changes in usage over time within utility service territories, and control for fluctuations in heating and cooling demands. I find that residential electricity consumption rose by about 8% on average during Q2-Q4 2020, while commercial and industrial usage fell by 7% and 8%, respectively. A similar analysis at the state level for natural gas also reveals a shift away from commercial and industrial natural gas usage, toward residential consumption, which rose over 4%. As a result, aggregate electricity and natural gas consumption fell by 1% and 2%, respectively, over a period in which total output was 5% lower than the previous year. In other words, use of these sources increased in intensity per unit of GDP as economic activity shifted away from workplaces.====This shift toward residential energy consumption occurred in tandem with a significant reduction in travel: aggregate consumption of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel fell by 15%, 5%, and 46%, respectively. In total, energy expenditure fell about 8% evaluated at 2019 prices, marginally larger than the fall in economic activity overall during this period.====I then evaluate the correlates of changes in electricity consumption, and find that residential electricity consumption rose more in areas more predisposed to work from home (WFH, Dingel and Neiman (2020)). This is especially true in warm climates. Higher unemployment is also associated with a shift toward residential electricity consumption, as are non-essential business closures during the pandemic. Highlighting the unusual nature of the COVID-19 shock, I show that an increase in residential electricity consumption is not a general feature of economic downturns—it did not occur during the Great Recession.====The shift from workplace to home energy usage is also a reallocation of financial burden, especially because residential retail rates tend to be higher. Tallying total expenditure changes over the nine-month period from April to December 2020, American households spent nearly $12B in excess residential electricity consumption and an additional $1B on natural gas. This increased expenditure reduces the net benefits of WFH associated with less commuting (Barrero, Bloom, Davis, Barrero, Bloom, Davis, Brodeur, Cook, Wright) and improved environmental quality (Cicala, Holland, Mansur, Muller, Yates, 2021, Gillingham, Knittel, Li, Ovaere, Reguant, 2020, Quéré, Jackson, Jones, Smith, Abernethy, Andrew, De-gol, Willis, Shan, Canadell, Friedlingstein, Creutzig, Peters, 2020). The reduction in transportation fuel was $60B at 2019 prices, but this is not broken down by sector.==== Electricity expenditures for commercial and industrial customers fell by $9B and $4B, respectively.====Finally, I evaluate hourly residential consumption from smart meters in Texas to reveal how usage has changed over the work week. I find that the patterns that used to distinguish work days from weekends have largely disappeared—residential electricity consumption during the pandemic rises later in the morning, and is 16% higher during weekday work hours, mirroring the pattern of weekend usage during normal times.====This paper also has important implications for the emergent literature that uses real-time electricity consumption to proxy for economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic (Cicala, Benedikt, Radulescu, Buechler, Powell, Sun, Zanocco, Astier, Bolorinos, Chen, Igan, Pierri, Presbitero, Fezzi, Fanghella, Figer, Jardim, Medeiros, International Association for Energy Economists, 2020, Leach, Rivers, Shaffer, 2020, Richter de Almeida, 2020). The appeal of electricity consumption as an economic indicator is based on its real-time availability, universal use in economic activity, and lack of substitutes. This allows one to learn about high-frequency changes in economic activity by monitoring electricity consumption—but the appropriate conversion factor between changes in electricity and economic activity is yet to be determined. This paper provides evidence that higher residential usage is masking significant declines in commercial and industrial consumption.====While total U.S. electricity consumption returned to normal levels by July 2020, industrial and commercial usage remained 5–10% below normal for the remainder of 2020. This deviation from normal for commercial and industrial usage is similar to that of the sluggish state of the economy in early 2010, following the Great Recession. While the rise in residential electricity consumption highlights the distinct nature of the COVID-19 economic shock, the persistent reduction in commercial and industrial consumption indicates significant weakness in the economy in spite of what appear to be nominal levels of total usage. A hybrid work posture with both higher levels of residential usage and reopened commercial spaces is likely to entail a net growth in electricity consumption overall. This would present a false signal of economic strength in electricity-based indices.====The paper is organized as follows: I first describe the data sources in Section 2, then the econometric methods I employ in Section 3. The fourth section presents the results, focusing on electricity, and the final section concludes.

Some aim to understand what factors determine the restrictiveness of land use regulations; others examine the effects of land use regulations on various outcomes such as local housing prices. Most of the stringency measures used in the literature are pragmatically constructed atheoretical indexes. For example, Levine (1999) counts the number of enacted local growth controls in California, and Gyourko et al. (2008) calculate a residential land use regulatory index for U.S. states and metropolitan areas.==== These measures do not have a theoretical explanation. More importantly, they do not properly take into account local conditions. Whereas a ten-story height limit can be very restrictive in Manhattan of New York City, it is unlikely to be binding in Manhattan, Kansas. Thus one would like a stringency measure to be defined relative to local conditions.====Three theoretically motivated measures of land use stringency have this desired property. The first is given by Fu and Somerville (2001). In a study of site density restrictions in China, they argue that “the marginal land value of development density... describes the extent to which density restrictions constrain development at any given site.” That is, the restriction is more stringent if a marginal relaxation increases land value by a larger amount. I will refer to this as the ==== measure of stringency. The second is proposed by Glaeser et al. (2005). Investigating the rising housing prices in New York City, Glaeser and coauthors define the regulatory tax as the difference between the market price of a housing unit and the marginal cost of that unit (if without regulations). They argue that a larger difference represents more restrictive regulations. Following their terminology, I will call this the ==== measure.==== The third measure is proposed by Brueckner et al. (2017). They argue that the stringency of a land use regulation should be measured as the ratio of the profit maximizing choice (in absence of the regulation) to the regulated level. I will refer to this ratio as the ==== measure of stringency because it shows the relative difference between the developer’s optimal choice and the government’s regulated level. Since this ratio is unobservable, Brueckner and coauthors propose to estimate the elasticity of land price to the regulated level of constraint, which they prove to be positively correlated with the relative gap measure of stringency.==== Tan et al. (2020) show that this relative gap measure is positively correlated with the share of land cost in housing value, thus they propose to measure land use stringency using estimated land share.====In this short paper, I propose an alternative theoretically attractive approach to measuring the stringency of land use regulation. Assume that the land developer maximizes profit subject to the constraint of a regulation. By the envelope theorem, the Lagrangian multiplier of this constrained optimization problem can be interpreted as the amount of profit loss resulting from a marginal increase in the tightness of the regulation. I argue that this Lagrangian multiplier can be used as a measure of land use stringency. By this measure, a regulation is more stringent if tightening it slightly leads to a larger profit loss for the developer. In other words, a regulation is more restrictive if the land developer has to pay a higher shadow price.====Although seemingly unrelated, the existing theory-based measures of stringency are either equivalents or variations of the shadow price measure. Under perfect competition among developers, the change in developer’s profit is fully reflected in the change in land price. Consequently, the marginal value measure is the same as the shadow price measure. The regulatory tax is exactly the extra profit a developer could make had regulations been relaxed to allow for the building of another unit of housing, thus it is essentially a shadow price paid by developers. As will be shown below, the elasticity estimated by Brueckner et al. (2017) and the land share estimated by Tan et al. (2020) are both monotonic transformations of the shadow price measure. My formulation therefore provides a unified framework for understanding a range of recent empirical studies on land use stringency.====This shadow price measure of land use stringency is appealing in several aspects. Most importantly, it can be extended to measure and compare the stringency of multiple regulations. This is feasible simply because the Lagrangian method is capable of dealing with optimization under multiple constraints. In my empirical exercise, using data from China, I measure and compare the stringency of two regulations on residential development, a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) restriction and a minimum green coverage ratio (GCR) requirement.",JUE Insight: Measuring the Stringency of Land Use Regulation Using a Shadow Price Approach,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119022000389,10 May 2022,2022,Research Article,29.0

We compare single-family housing price growth in OZs with price growth in areas that were eligible but not included in the program. We also compare OZs to their nearest geographic neighbors. Our most credible estimates rule out price impacts greater than 0.5 percentage points with 95% confidence, suggesting that, so far, home buyers don’t believe that this subsidy will generate major neighborhood change. OZ status reduces prices in areas with little employment, perhaps because buyers think that subsidizing new investment will increase housing supply. Mixed evidence suggests that OZs may have increased residential permitting.","Opportunity Zones (OZs), established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), arguably represent the U.S. government’s largest place-based policy innovation since Empowerment Zones were introduced in 1993. When capital gains are invested in OZs, taxes on the original gains are deferred and can be reduced; taxes on future gains from qualifying investments in OZs are largely eliminated. Will this significant tax-based subsidy lead to neighborhood improvements?====We test this hypothesis by examining whether areas that are designated as OZs subsequently experience an increase in residential real estate prices. If OZ designation is seen as a harbinger of future investment, then new buyers should presumably anticipate future neighborhood improvements and be willing to pay more for homes. If OZs are ineffective, or act primarily to generate more residential supply, then OZs will have little impact on price. Indeed, there is some empirical evidence that local housing prices respond to changes in neighborhood-level housing supply; see Asquith et al. (2019); Pennington (2021); Li (2019). It is too early to test the more interesting and important question of whether OZs impact people as well as place, and whether they positively impact the lives of neighborhood residents.==== Moreover, we only have price data available for 2018–2020, and the OZ tracts were designated by governors in the first few months of 2018 and officially posted in July.====A non-peer reviewed study of housing prices, done by Zillow (Casey, 2019), found a positive effect of OZs on prices when comparing OZ areas with areas that did not receive zone status, but there are two reasons to be cautious about this work. First, the pre-2017 trends in prices between their treatment and control samples do not appear to be parallel. They provide no tested pre-trends. Second, Casey (2019) results also do not control for changes in the quality of houses sold, since they include all arms’ length sales prices. Relatedly, another non-academic study by ATTOM Data Solutions (2020) observes that OZs found median home price increases, also using proprietary data. However, the study does not compare OZs to similar places without OZ designation, and thus its results cannot be interpreted causally. More recently, the CEA (2020) replicated our analysis from the working paper version of this paper (Chen et al., 2019).====We use the FHFA repeat sales-indices for single-family homes at the tract and ZIP code level to measure price changes (Bogin et al., 2019).==== We perform three different empirical exercises. First, we follow Casey (2019) and compare OZ areas with areas that were initially eligible for OZ status, but then not included as OZs, assuming and testing for parallel trends. Second, we use propensity-score weighting methods to include observed characteristics nonparametrically in the difference-in-difference design, making and testing a conditional parallel trends assumption. Third, we compare OZ areas with bordering areas. As many tracts have missing data, we perform the exercises at the ZIP code level in addition to at the tract level as well.====All exercises yield a similar result: OZs appear to have a negligible price impact that is statistically indistinct from zero. Our results are sufficiently precise that we can generally rule out a tract-level price impact of 1.5 percentage points or more annually. Our point estimates are typically between 0 and 0.5 percentage points. This finding suggests that buyers do not believe that OZ status will generate a significant change in the economic fortunes of the neighborhood. Alternatively, buyers could be myopic, but that seems unlikely if the zone status attracts professional investors. One possible explanation for our null result is that the overall treatment effect combines a positive shock to housing demand and a positive shock to housing supply, since OZ status provides financial incentives that could encourage more residential construction. To test this possibility, we compare ZIP codes in predominantly residential areas with ZIP codes that are predominantly commercial areas. We hypothesized that the positive impact of OZs on housing supply should be stronger in already residential areas, and so the impact of OZ status on housing prices should be lower in those areas.====With an interaction specification, we do find that the treatment effect of zone status is weakly positive in non-residential areas, and the interaction between OZ status and being predominantly residential is negative. Our point estimates do indeed suggest that OZs appear to have increased prices in less residential areas and reduced prices in more residential areas. Yet the estimated effects are small and our standard errors are too large to rule out a zero impact in either type of area.====We supplement our primary work on prices by examining the impact of OZs on building permits, which is our best measure of new housing supply. Since places are a much coarser geography, we present results using a simple difference-in-difference methodology. We do find a small positive impact of OZ on the number of permits, but not on the number of permits relative to the stock of housing in 2010. Our results are compatible with the view that OZ status encouraged some construction, especially in smaller places.====This work does not imply that OZs were a mistake or that there are no benefits from these zones. These tax subsidies may generate neighborhood change in the future that buyers do not anticipate today.==== The costs of these subsidies may end up being so small that they are offset by even tiny price gains. Nonetheless, the absence of a visible price effect does suggest the limits of place-based policies, especially those that focus on investment in physical rather than human capital.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the institutional context, policy details, and selection procedures for OZs. Section 3 discusses the various data sources used in our study. Section 4 introduces our three main empirical strategies. Section 5 discusses the empirical results. Section 7 concludes.

We leverage restricted-access microdata from the American ","There is a lack of clear evidence that the most prominent place-based policy – enterprise zones – has created jobs and raised incomes for the least-advantaged people in neighborhoods with high concentrations of low-income residents (see the review in Neumark and Simpson, 2015). Nonetheless, with strong encouragement from the Trump Administration, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created a new place-based policy: “Opportunity Zones.” Opportunity Zones are targeted at disadvantaged census tracts and are intended to spur economic development. The Opportunity Zone program allows deferral or avoidance of federal taxes on capital gains for those who invest in these zones.====In this paper, we provide early evidence on the impacts of Opportunity Zone designation on residents of zones, focusing in particular on employment, earnings, and poverty. We take advantage of restricted-access microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2013-2019 to explore the program's impacts at a geographically granular level. We estimate effects for tracts designated as Opportunity Zones using a control group of eligible, but not designated tracts matched on the basis of trends in outcomes prior to the program's introduction. With our data, we can study effects up to about one-and-a-half years after enactment of the zones.====Overall, we find limited evidence that Opportunity Zone designation has positive effects on the economic conditions of local residents. Our preferred estimates based on an inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach point to effects of Opportunity Zone designation that are economically small and generally statistically indistinguishable from zero. Specifically, we estimate that following Opportunity Zone designation, employment rates of residents do not change, with statistically insignificant yet fairly precise estimates that are very near zero. We can rule out increases in employment rates larger than 0.2 percentage point with 95% confidence. Estimated effects on average earnings of employed residents of designated tracts are positive, but are economically small and not consistently statistically significant. We additionally find that, if anything, zone designation is associated with a slight increase in local poverty rates, although the evidence is largely consistent with no effect.====Notably, a difference-in-differences approach that ignores differential pre-designation trends implies positive effects on zone resident employment rates and reductions in poverty rates, with effects that are both statistically significant and economically meaningful. The problem of differential pre-designation trends is also apparent from an event-study analysis. Hence, an approach that assumes that zone selection was orthogonal to tracts’ economic trajectories gives the misleading impression of substantial positive effects of zone designation on residents.====Given that Opportunity Zone designations were first announced in 2018, we are at the beginning of research on the impacts of the program.==== In recent work, Arefeva et al. (2021) leverage establishment-level data (the Your-economy Time Series) and find that Opportunity Zone designation increased employment growth relative to comparable (eligible, but not chosen) tracts significantly (by 3.0 to 4.5 percentage points), with the growth spread across industries. Atkins et al. (2021) study Opportunity Zone effects on job postings (from Burning Glass) by zip code, distinguished by whether the zip code contains at least one Opportunity Zone tract or not. They find only limited evidence of any effects of zone designation on job postings or posted salaries.====Other recent work has studied the effects of Opportunity Zone designations on investment and real estate markets. While Corinth and Feldman (2021) find no impacts of zone designation on commercial investments, Sage et al. (2021) document significant positive effects on the prices of some types of commercial properties. Frank et al. (2020) also find positive effects of Opportunity Zone designation on commercial real estate transactions, building permits, and construction employment. However, Chen et al. (2019) find little effect of Opportunity Zone designation on residential property prices.====The main contribution of our paper is that we identify the impacts of the Opportunity Zone program on zone residents as opposed to businesses, workers, or property values. To the extent that a major motivation for the Opportunity Zone program was improving outcomes for residents of distressed communities – as evidenced by the criteria for designating Opportunity Zones being based largely on the economic circumstances of residents – the impacts of the program on residents is of paramount importance. Past work on place-based policies suggests that even those programs that are effective at creating jobs may not deliver benefits to residents of targeted places (Busso et al., 2013; Freedman, 2015; Reynolds and Rohlin, 2015). The institutional structure of the Opportunity Zone program raises concerns that any job creation or investment spurred by the program may have limited benefits for local residents (Gelfond and Looney, 2018; Eastman and Kaeding, 2019). Our data on the economic conditions of those living in Opportunity Zones allow us to speak directly to the program's benefits for residents. By examining impacts on residents, we also provide evidence comparable to that for enterprise zones and other place-based policies (e.g., Freedman, 2012; Busso et al., 2013; Neumark and Young, 2019).====An additional contribution of our evaluation is the use of rich, granular demographic and economic information available in the confidential ACS together with alternative empirical approaches based on selecting suitable sets of comparison groups. We first leverage our detailed data to establish that tracts designated as Opportunity Zones were on different trajectories, particularly with respect to employment and poverty rates, than tracts eligible but not designated. These differential trends undermine a simple difference-in-differences approach to estimating the causal effects of Opportunity Zone designation using eligible but not designated tracts as a control group. We therefore use a refined comparison group, assigning weights to control tracts to better match the evolution of outcomes for treated tracts prior to Opportunity Zone designation. By addressing differences in underlying trends in outcomes across designated and non-designated (but eligible) tracts, our matching approach delivers more credible estimates of the program's effects on residents of targeted areas.",JUE Insight: The Impacts of Opportunity Zones on Zone Residents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000899,31 October 2021,2021,Research Article,34.0

First, I use address history data to identify 52,000 residents of new multifamily buildings in large cities, their previous address, the current residents of those addresses, and so on for six rounds. The sequence quickly reaches units in below-median income neighborhoods, which account for nearly 40 percent of the sixth round, and similar patterns appear for neighborhoods in the bottom quintile of income or percent white. Next, I use a simple simulation model to roughly quantify these migratory connections under a range of assumptions. Constructing a new market-rate building that houses 100 people ultimately leads 45 to 70 people to move out of below-median income neighborhoods, with most of the effect occurring within three years. These results suggest that the migration ripple effects of new housing will affect a wide spectrum of neighborhoods and loosen the low-income housing market.","There are a variety of approaches to affordable housing policy. Many government interventions, such as constructing affordable units or requiring income-restricted units in new developments, directly add to the stock of affordable housing. Another set of strategies encourage market-rate housing construction through relaxed land-use regulation or subsidies. Because most new construction is expensive, the latter approach only indirectly affects the stock of affordable housing. These indirect “filtering” effects are nuanced and difficult to observe, but they are crucial for understanding the relative merits of the two approaches and formulating optimal housing policy.====A long, largely theoretical literature has considered filtering in a variety of models (Sweeney, 1974, Braid, 1981, Nathanson). In the long run, new housing can depreciate and gradually become affordable, as shown empirically by Weicher et al. (2010); Rosenthal (2014), and Liu et al. (2020). In the short run, new housing can affect existing units by causing a reallocation of people across submarkets.==== Households who would have otherwise occupied cheaper units move into new units, reducing demand and prices for the housing they leave vacant. The process iterates when a second round of households moves into the units the first round left vacant, creating what is sometimes called a migration or vacancy chain. There is little empirical evidence on this short-run reallocation, although it is crucially important to policymakers seeking quick relief to declining housing affordability.====In this paper, I help fill this gap in the literature by using new data on individual address histories to directly study the migration chains started by new housing. My main exercises leverage this data to compute descriptive statistics that provide new insights into this long-hypothesized but empirically elusive mechanism. I then use a stylized simulation model to provide ballpark estimates of how these chains affect the low-income housing market. The paper also adds to scholarship on land-use regulation (reviewed by Gyourko and Molloy, 2015) by studying migration mechanisms and using a new empirical approach.====My primary contribution is to document the sequences of moves sparked by new housing construction. I use address history data from Infutor Data Solutions to identify 686 large new market-rate multifamily buildings in 12 large central cities and track 52,000 of their current residents to their previous building of residence. I then find the tenants currently living in those buildings and track them to their previous residence (reweighting accordingly) and iterate for six rounds. When computing statistics about each round, I include only chains I can track to that round and, to prevent contamination from demographic differences across metros, only migrants from the same metropolitan area.====New building residents largely originate from nearby high-income areas. Sixty-seven percent arrive from within the same metro, and only 20% of those within-metro arrivals originate in below-median income tracts. However, the proportion from low-income areas rises steadily to 40% in round six, and similar patterns emerge for other neighborhood income or demographic thresholds. The chains also diffuse geographically—the sixth round has about the same suburban share as the metropolitan area as a whole. This exercise suggests that the reallocation resulting from new housing construction spans a diverse set of neighborhoods and is likely to loosen a wide spectrum of housing submarkets.====My second contribution is a set of simulation estimates of how new high-end construction affects the low- and middle-income housing markets. The simulation is similar in spirit to the previous exercise but adds two key factors. First, instead of constructing the next round of a chain based on a household’s origin unit, I use a calibrated estimate of where the household would have lived in a counterfactual world with no construction. For example, consider empty-nesters who moved from a suburb to a new building, but would have moved to some part of the city anyway. The next round of chain is the unit they would have moved to otherwise, not the suburban origin unit. Second, a chain can end if, for example, new construction induces household formation or migration from outside the metro.====Because these factors are unobservable and difficult to estimate, I run the simulation under a range of calibrations. The baseline, best suited to a marginal increase in supply, is the following. First, had the new buildings not been constructed, households would have lived in a neighborhood that is one decile higher in the metropolitan income distribution than their origin, but similar on other characteristics. Second, chains end due to unfilled vacancies resulting from matching frictions or landlord market power (proxied by neighborhood average vacancy rates), but there is no endogenous increase in out-of-metro migration or household formation in response to the new construction.====In the baseline, seventy percent of migration chains started by a new high-end unit reach a below-median income neighborhood before ending, implying that building 100 new units reduces demand for these areas by 70. Assuming that reducing demand and increasing supply have symmetric price effects, this can be interpreted as equivalent to adding 70 depreciated units in below-median income areas. In a more conservative specification that allows for some endogenous household formation and out-of-metro migration, more accurately capturing the effects of a larger supply increase, the percent of chains reaching below-median income areas falls to 45. For bottom-quintile income neighborhoods, these two calibrations return estimates of 40% and 17%. These estimates provide important context to the descriptive results—the observed migratory connectivity is strong enough that chains frequently reach low-income areas even under conservative assumptions. Moreover, the simulation implies that nearly all of the effect occurs within five years.====Finally, my third contribution is documenting migratory connectivity across neighborhoods more generally. Migration between neighborhoods with moderately different characteristics is quite common—for example, individuals originating in the fifth income decile frequently move to the fourth or seventh decile, but rarely the tenth or first. This helps reinforce the migration chain results, and it also suggests that other spatially concentrated shocks may diffuse across very different neighborhoods through a short series of common moves. This adds a new measure of connectivity within cities to a growing literature that has previously considered housing search (Piazzesi et al., 2020) and social networks (Bailey et al., 2020).====Together, these results suggest that new market-rate housing construction loosens the market for middle- and low-income housing, even in the short run, pointing to an important role for policies that increase construction. However, I do not estimate price effects, which are particularly unclear in neighborhoods where rents are already close to operating costs, leaving little room for reduced demand to lower them further. In addition, the endogenous response of out-of-metro migration and household formation may strengthen over time, moderating affordability effects in the long run.",JUE Insight: The effect of new market-rate housing construction on the low-income housing market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000656,27 July 2021,2021,Research Article,35.0

Because multi-plant firms tend cluster their establishments in space, industry agglomeration could in part be driven by forces internal to the firm rather than across-firm ====. We propose and implement a decomposition of the industry agglomeration measures into within and across-firm components using U.S. census microdata. The within-firm component makes a small contribution to observed industry agglomeration for most industries and spatial scales, but accounts for 20% or more of observed agglomeration at short spatial scales for a subset of industries.","Measures of industry agglomeration are crucial spatial statistics, in part because they suggest the strength of the agglomeration forces that generate them. Recent studies on the spatial structure of firms finds that firms cluster their constituent establishments more closely than the typical group of establishments in that industry (Behrens and Sharunova 2015; Bartelme and Ziv 2020). This finding raises the possibility that measured industry-level agglomeration may reflect within-firm establishment clustering as well as industry-level clustering of unrelated establishments. Existing measures do not account for the role of within-firm clustering in industry agglomeration (e.g. (Ellison and Glaeser 1997; Duranton and Overman 2005)).====The distinction between within-firm clustering and across-firm clustering is relevant for understanding both the causes of industry agglomeration and the implications for optimal policy. The literature typically explains industry-level agglomeration by a mix of exogenous local characteristics and endogenous outcomes of concentrated economic activity, such as thick local markets for specialized labor and other inputs, or localized knowledge flows (see Ellison et al., 2010; Rosenthal and Strange 2004). The strength of these endogenous agglomeration forces may vary depending on whether they occur within or across firms; for example, “thick input markets” explanations presuppose the presence of many firms, while knowledge may flow more easily within firms than across. Hence knowing whether observed agglomeration is within or across firm is informative for explaining its ultimate causes. Furthermore, the optimal policy depends on whether these endogenous agglomeration forces are internal or external to firms. To the extent that observed agglomerations reflect across-firm forces there may be policy-relevant externalities; to the extent that they reflect within-firm agglomeration forces, they are already internalized by the firms when making their location decisions.====This paper proposes and implements a decomposition of the (employment-weighted) density of bilateral plant distances introduced by (Duranton and Overman 2005) into within and across-firm components. Differences between total industry agglomeration and across-firm agglomeration at any spatial scale can be attributed to a combination of a) differences between the within and across firm distributions at that scale, and b) the relative weight of each distribution in the overall density. Using this decomposition, we propose two measures to quantify the contribution of within-firm agglomeration to the overall level of agglomeration in an industry at different spatial scales. We then implement this decomposition using confidential US Census microdata on the location and firm structure of manufacturing establishments in 2012, with industries measured at the 4-digit NAICS level.====We find that on average the within-firm density is much higher than the across-firm density at short spatial scales, in line with the findings in (Behrens and Sharunova 2015) and (Bartelme and Ziv 2020). For example, in the median industry two employees selected at random from a single firm are about 5 times more likely to be within 20 miles of each other than two randomly selected employees at different firms, with the difference rising to about 17 at the 90th percentile for manufacturing and about 37 for services. Nevertheless, the overall contribution of the within-firm component to total industry agglomeration is modest (around 2% at the median) for most industries at most spatial scales, because the overall proportion of within-firm bilateral pairs (which determines the weight on the within-firm component of the distribution) is low for most industries. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For industries at the 90th percentile, between 16% (manufacturing) and 22% (services) of bilateral pairs within 20 miles of one another are within-firm. We provide a list of the most industries for which the within-firm component is most significant, which includes some classic examples of highly agglomerated industries such as textiles, auto manufacturing and several IT and financial industries. We conclude that within-firm location patterns are usually not important for explaining industry agglomeration, but can significantly affect industry agglomeration measures at short distances in a subset of industries.====Our paper contributes to the sizable literature on measuring industry agglomeration, e.g. (Ellison and Glaeser 1997; Marcon and Puech 2003, 2017; Duranton and Overman 2005; Delgado et al., 2015; Buzard et al., 2017; Kopczewska et al., 2019). Our contribution to this literature is to introduce a new decomposition of industry agglomeration into within and across-firm components and document the relative importance of each in U.S. manufacturing data. Our paper also contributes to the literature that attempts to explain the sources of industry agglomeration (e.g. (Rosenthal and Strange 2001; Ellison et al., 2010; Alfaro and Chen 2014; Billings and Johnson 2016)) as well as the correlation between agglomeration and economic outcomes (e.g. (Porter 2000; Holmes and Stevens 2002; Henderson 2003; Kerr and Kominers 2015; Alfaro et al., 2019)) and a growing literature on the geography of multi-establishment firms (Behrens and Sharunova 2015; Bartelme and Ziv 2020; Lan 2019; Hsieh and Rossi-Hansberg 2019; Oberfield et al., 2020). The relationship between agglomeration and outcomes is typically conceived as resulting from the causal impact of agglomeration forces that are external to the firm, or from selection. Our paper raises the possibility that the internal geographic structure of multi-unit firms also partly accounts for both the observed levels of industry agglomeration and their correlations with economic outcomes. In practice we find that this channel is unlikely to be a major driver of agglomeration patterns in most industries.",JUE Insight: Firms and industry agglomeration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000541,30 June 2021,2021,Research Article,36.0

Improvement in domestic transportation infrastructure reduces trade costs between inner regions and international markets while leaving coastal regions’ ,"Developing countries face substantial internal trade costs.==== Meanwhile, these developing countries have become increasingly integrated with global trade in recent decades. To the extent that the interior parts of a country access the world markets through shipping goods via the coastal ports, an improvement in domestic transportation infrastructure not only increases domestic trade, but also improves inner region’s global market access. However, most research on transportation infrastructure focuses on a closed economy framework and ignores the role of better international market access due to reductions in domestic trade costs.====In the meantime, the interior parts of a large country benefit little from international trade liberalizations due to large shipping costs to coastal ports.==== Therefore, better domestic transportation infrastructure also improves inner region’s access to coastal ports and, therefore, mitigates the distributional consequences of trade liberalization.==== Recent quantitative work on trade, however, has paid little attention to the welfare implications of improved access to ports for inner regions.====Therefore, in this paper, we use a quantitative framework that features regional differences in access to coastal ports to quantify the aggregate and distributional effects of domestic or international trade cost reductions. In contrast to the existing literature, we explore the welfare gains from improvements in international market access through better domestic transportation infrastructure. Specifically, we answer the following questions. First, given that inner regions get access to global markets via coastal ports, to what extent does improvement in transportation infrastructure generate additional benefits to inner regions, and what are the implications for the distribution of welfare gains across space? Second, do the answers to the first question depend on the fact that inner regions participate in global trade via coastal ports?====We begin with a one-sector model that analyzes the welfare effects of trade cost reductions in a two-country three-region hub economy. The home country has two regions, the coastal and inner regions, and the inner region accesses the foreign country via the international ports at the coastal region. An improvement in domestic transportation infrastructure reduces domestic trade costs. Meanwhile, it decreases the inner region’s trade costs with the foreign country while leaving the coastal region’s international trade costs unaffected. Hence the improvement in domestic transportation infrastructure implies an asymmetric international trade cost reduction in favor of the inner region. We use this setup to capture the fact that in a large developing country, most international trade occurs via coastal ports, and inner regions do not have direct access to the seas.====We derive two theoretical results. First, we illustrate that the inner region benefits more from international trade due to domestic trade cost reductions. Second, the inner region benefits ==== from international trade cost reductions when the domestic trade costs are ====. The reason is that lower ==== trade costs makes it easier for the inner region to access international markets via the coastal region, which amplifies the welfare gains from both reductions in domestic and international trade costs. These theoretical results have two implications. First, easier access to international markets for inner regions amplifies the aggregate welfare impacts of an improvement in domestic transportation infrastructure. Second, while coastal regions have easier access to foreign markets than inner regions, an improvement in domestic transportation infrastructure mitigates the distributional effects of international trade.====To assess the quantitative importance of the welfare gains from improved access to ports, we build a two-country multi-region two-sector trade model with input-output linkages ==== la Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Caliendo and Parro (2015). We apply this quantitative framework to China with 30 provinces. China has experienced both large reductions in tariffs following its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 and decreases in domestic transportation costs because of the construction of the National Trunk Highway System.====We estimate the reductions in domestic trade costs from the changes in travel time between capital cities of each province from 2000 to 2013. To relate the unobserved trade costs to travel time, we first use a gravity equation of trade to back out the model-implied trade costs, and then regress the changes of these model-implied trade costs on the changes in travel time. We find that an hour reduction in travel time between capital cities reduces domestic trade costs by 1–1.2%.====We calibrate the initial equilibrium for the Chinese economy in 2000. We carry out counterfactual exercises by applying the observed changes in travel time or tariff rates to the initial equilibrium. To quantify the welfare implications of improved access to ports, we apply the same shocks to a restricted framework in which reductions in domestic travel time do not influence international trade costs for the inner regions, whereas transportation infrastructure improvement reduces the inner regions’ trade costs with the foreign market in our baseline framework. The difference in the welfare changes under both frameworks represent the welfare consequences of improvement in access to ports.====We find that for inner regions, the welfare gains from improved access to ports are 0.2% on average, which accounts for 16% of the overall welfare gains from travel time reductions. Furthermore, a thousand-kilometer increase in distance to international gateways amplifies the welfare gains from improved access to ports by 0.45%, which is 31% of the inner regions’ average increase in welfare from travel time reductions. In terms of the spatial distribution of welfare gains, the inner regions gain 65% more than the coastal regions, while the number drops to 41% if we do not take into account the welfare consequences of improved access to ports. These results indicate that inner regions benefit from better domestic transportation infrastructure due to the enhanced access to global trade, which magnifies the aggregate welfare gains and helps reduce spatial inequality across the coastal and inner regions.====We also find that the welfare gains from observed tariff reductions are larger by 23% for inner regions if the travel time to coastal ports is reduced from year 2000 to year 2013 levels. By contrast, if we shut down the channel of improved access to ports for inner regions, then the welfare gains from tariff reductions vary little despite of the reductions in domestic travel time. The results from these counterfactual exercises highlight the importance of spatial features of trade in evaluating the welfare effects of domestic or international market integration.====This paper is related to the recent studies that quantify the welfare effects of improvements in domestic transportation infrastructure, mostly in a ==== economy setting (Allen, Arkolakis, 2014, Pérez-Cervantes, 2014, Donaldson, Hornbeck, 2016, Donaldson, 2018). Mostly closely related are the work by Van Leemput (2016) and Fan et al. (2020), who focus on using international trade flows to estimate domestic trade costs, and evaluate the welfare effects from domestic transportation infrastructure in the presence of international trade. Our paper complements these studies by pointing out that one reason to bring in international trade is that the inner regions benefit from better access to ports, and we show that this channel matters quantitatively when evaluating the welfare effects from an improvement in domestic transportation infrastructure.====Our work also contributes to the literature that explores the spatial impacts of transportation infrastructure projects (Baum-Snow, Brandt, Henderson, Turner, Zhang, 2017, Baum-Snow, Henderson, Turner, Zhang, Brandt, 2020, Banerjee, Duflo, Qian, 2020, Bird, Straub, 2015, Bosker, Deichmann, Roberts, 2018, Duranton, Turner, 2012, Faber, 2014, Lin, 2017, Michaels, 2008, Roberts, Deichmann, Fingleton, Shi, 2012, Storeygard, 2016, Zheng, Kahn, 2013). While this line of research provides micro-evidences on how domestic transportation projects affect population distribution and urban growth, our quantitative approach explores the heterogeneous real wage gains across locations in an open economy setup. Moreover, by considering the spatial structure of international trade whereby inner regions access foreign markets through domestic shipping to the nearest coastal ports, our counterfactual exercises reveal that improvement in domestic transportation infrastructure can help reduce spatial inequalities through the channel of better access to ports for inner regions.====More generally, this paper relates to the literature that studies the impacts of international trade on economies with domestic frictions. This includes works that studies regional specialization (Coşar and Fajgelbaum, 2016), within-country economic geography (Behrens, Gaigné, Ottaviano, Thisse, 2007, Behrens, 2011, Redding, 2016), cross-country income differences (Ramondo et al., 2016), and structural transformation (Fajgelbaum and Redding, 2018) with domestic trade costs. For studies with a focus on migration frictions in China (Zi, 2017, Fan, 2019, Ma, Tang, 2019, Tombe, Zhu, 2019), Fan (2019) and Zi (2017) illustrate that the abolishment of the Hukou system, an institutional policy that limits within-country migration in China, may alleviate the distributional effects of trade. Our paper complements these studies by showing that improvement in access to ports works as another force to mitigate the distributional effects of trade.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 documents the changes in tariff rates and domestic travel time in China between 2000 and 2013. Section 3 uses a one-sector trade model to derive the welfare effects from changes in trade costs. Section 4 extends the one-sector model to a quantifiable multi-sector multi-region general equilibrium framework, calibrates it to the Chinese economy and relates travel time to domestic trade costs. Section 5 conducts counterfactual experiments to quantify the welfare implications from improvement in access to coastal ports. Section 6 extends the framework by incorporating labor mobility or increasing returns to scale in production. It shows that the welfare gains from improved access to ports remain quantitatively relevant.

In contrast to extant research, our model is fully micro-founded with respect to the urban sector and the agglomeration mechanism as well as the modeling of pollution and pollution abatement. We derive two key insights. First, if the national government implements a permit system (equivalently, pollution taxes) that allow for emissions as in the first-best, cities chosen by local governments are too small. Second, if no emission scheme is implemented, or if emission policies are too lax, cities steered by local governments may become too large. The tractability of the model also allows us to uncover the determinants of optimal city sizes, emissions, emission intensities and determinants of locally chosen city sizes, as well as to address the second-best emission policy and extensions to city asymmetries, a fiscal externality, local pollution, generalized commuting costs and further pollution sources.","Are cities too small or too big? It is often voiced in the public debate that the world's large cities are oversized and prone to sprawl further. A classic line of economic reasoning indeed holds that free migration of people causes cities to become inefficiently big. This argument has been challenged by an influential recent line of research which points out that cities may actually be too small (e.g. Albouy et al., 2019; Au and Henderson, 2006; Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg, 2013; Hsieh and Moretti, 2019). A central argument in these analyses is that mobility restrictions imposed by local governments may keep city sizes too small so that countries forego large welfare benefits.====This paper contributes to this debate by establishing theoretical arguments why city sizes may be distorted away from the optimum (where city dwellers’ utility is maximized). The circumstances highlighted in this paper arise when activities in cities are associated with emissions that cause environmental pollution on the national (‘global’) level, the key example being CO====-emissions and global warming.==== First, if the national government implements a permit system (equivalently, pollution taxes) that allow for emissions as in the first-best, cities chosen by local governments are too small. Second, if no such national emission policy is implemented, or if the policy is too lax, as is quite likely the case in practice for political economy reasons, cities steered by local governments may become ====, and their overall number is too small.====We develop a parsimonious, yet rich, theoretical framework and impose a number of simplifications to make the analysis tractable and transparent. The key assumption is to build on Henderson's (1974) city systems model with an ==== number of cities. We build on a canonical version of this model with micro-foundations in the form of monocentric cities and agglomeration economies due to the sharing of inputs produced by intermediate firms under increasing returns and monopolistic competition with a constant elasticity of substitution across varieties (Duranton and Puga, 2004, 2014). We extend this model with a micro-founded pollution process with emission abatement as in Copeland and Taylor (1994, 2003). For the sake of tractability, we focus on two important sources of pollution in the main analysis, emissions associated with production and commuting.==== Emissions are controlled with permits or, equivalently in this model, with emission taxes. Key properties of the canonical city-systems model remain valid under this extension. In particular, the micro-foundations of agglomeration economies, on net, create no inefficiencies (see Section 2 for details). This allows us to highlight the interplay between mechanisms and policies to address urban agglomeration economies and environmental externalities.====We focus on comparing the social planner allocation (as implemented by a benevolent national government) with the allocation chosen by local governments. Of course, the evolution of cities and urban systems is shaped by various forces. Mobile people are attracted to locations that satisfy their pecuniary and non-pecuniary needs best, and local and national governments directly and indirectly influence cities and city sizes. However, there is a growing perception, if not a consensus, that local governments are the crucial actors in determining city sizes today.==== A further reason for this focus is that it allows us to highlight the interplay between policies chosen by local governments and by a (benevolent) national government.==== It is important to recall as a backdrop for the following, that local governments are able to establish optimal city sizes in the canonical version of the model (i.e. the model without polluting emissions). This is so because local governments, as ‘large agents’, are able to overcome the coordination failure resulting from locally increasing returns at small city sizes which leads to over-sized cities under free migration, and because the assumed redistribution of land rents acts as a Pigouvian subsidy which internalizes the urban agglomeration externality (e.g. Duranton and Puga, 2004).====The key results of our paper, the mentioned city biases that arise in the micro-founded model with an endogenous location number and with pollution abatement under global environmental pollution, reveal a surprising discrepancy. Cities are too small when the national government fixes emissions at a level as in the first-best, but may become too large when such an emission policy is absent or too lax. The first result is due to a positive externality associated with city size on global pollution. Global pollution depends on the product of emissions of a city and the number of cities. Increasing city size reduces their number and, hence, global pollution. The benevolent planner addresses the global environmental externality, and hence takes this link between city size (and hence their number) and global pollution into account. Apart from choosing an optimal emission policy, the social planner also determines optimal city size, and in doing so, economizes on the creation of new cities. Local governments, in contrast, maximize city dwellers per-capita income without regard to global pollution. By ignoring the (negative) global environmental externality, they ignore the mentioned positive externality in choosing city size. The second result follows from the fact that emissions, apart from harming consumers, also have a positive effect on productivity and wages so that local governments’ choice of city size depends on the emission level set by the national emission scheme. If national governments do not regulate emissions properly, city sizes may easily grow beyond the optimal level.====In addition to deriving these key results, we use the micro-founded model to uncover the determinants of optimal city sizes, emissions and emission intensities as well as the determinants of locally chosen city sizes. We also address a second-best policy and extensions of the analysis to a general utility function, to multiple city outputs and city asymmetries, to a fiscal externality which arises when the proceeds from the national emission scheme are wasted, to local rather than global pollution, and to generalized commuting costs, and we discuss how further pollution sources fit into the analysis.==== Our analysis relates to the theoretical research on the optimal distribution of population across cities and to research which has started to explore the nexus between city size and the environment. The former research grounds on the insight that cities become too big under self-organization due to a coordination failure that results from local increasing returns at small city size (Henderson, 1974). Efficiency can be restored by competitive land-developers or by local governments which act on behalf of the atomistic agents (Henderson, 1974; Becker and Henderson, 2000; Abdel-Rahman and Anas, 2004). Albouy et al. (2019) show that inefficiently small city sizes arise in the presence of positive fiscal externalities or when sites are heterogeneous (due to Ricardian differences in land, amenities). We add to this literature by identifying novel reasons why city sizes may be distorted away from the optimum which arise under (global) environmental pollution, as explained above.====Even though it is widely recognized that environmental pollution, global warming in particular, is one of the key problems for humanity, the interrelation between city size and pollution has only rarely and recently been addressed. This research, largely inspired by Glaeser's (2011) hypothesis that large cities may make us not only richer, smarter and more productive, but also greener (see also Kahn and Walsh, 2015; Kahn, 2006), has an empirical and a theoretical strand. Glaeser and Kahn (2010), the seminal study in the empirical literature, looks at carbon dioxide emissions by households in American metro areas, and finds that denser cities have lower emissions. Blaudin de Thé et al. (2020) address household fuel consumption and car emissions in France. They obtain a bell-shaped relationship between the metropolitan population and per-household car emissions and they find, that the design of cities matters, i.e. not only the large but also small cities turn out to be environmentally-friendly. These two studies exemplify that the jury is still out on the relationship between per capita emissions and city size.==== The theoretical research on Glaeser's hypothesis sheds light on the mechanisms which (may) underlie the empirical ambiguities. Gaigné et al. (2012) set up a new economic geography oligopoly model to show that the hypothesis needs to be qualified when intra- and intercity interactions (longer commutes and the transport of goods between cities) are taken into account. Borck and Pflüger (2019) go a step further and allow for variable lot sizes, a key mechanism in favor of less intensive energy consumption in dense cities (Glaeser, 2011). Numerical analyses with their core-periphery model yields the result that per capita emissions are lower under dispersion, however, reinforcing the qualification stressed by Gaigné et al. (2012). The role of building heights, mobility frictions and various policies (e.g. transport policies, congestion policies, spatial policies) have been addressed in related research.====Bridging the literatures, Borck and Tabuchi (2019) develop a city systems model with black-box mechanisms for agglomeration and pollution which are assumed to be separate iso-elastic functions of city size. The lack of micro-foundations and this separation stand in sharp contrast to our model. As a result, the city economy in their model works independently of the pollution process, whilst emissions (and their abatement) are key for productivity, wages, commuting, emission intensities, and per-capita emissions in our model. While we identify microeconomic determinants and the emission policy as drivers of per-capita emissions, they simply assume that per-capita emissions either rise or fall with city size. One implication of this agnostic treatment of the pollution process in Borck and Tabuchi (2019) is that the deviation of city size from the optimum in the symmetric city system may go either way under global pollution.==== Moreover, there is no room for an emission policy distinct from the choice of city size in their model. This rules out the possibility that city sizes may become too big when the national emission policy is too lax, our second key result. Our micro-founded model also allows us to scrutinize further dimensions of the interplay between policies chosen by local governments and policies by a national government, notably a second-best emission policy, and political economy circumstances where the proceeds from an emission policy are wasted. It should also be pointed out that we extend our analysis to a setting with trade across cities (see Section 4) whereas there is no trade across cities in Albouy et al. (2019) and Borck and Tabuchi (2019).====The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 compares the social planner solution with the allocation chosen by local governments when environmental pollution is global.

Chin Mark J.,"Harvard University, 1350 Massachusetts Avenue, Suite 350, Cambridge, MA 02138, United States of America","Received 20 May 2021, Revised 3 September 2021, Available online 10 September 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2021.103389,Cited by (4),In this paper I study the impact of court-mandated school desegregation by race on student suspensions and ==== classification. Simple ==== by race.,"A rich literature shows that the desegregation of K-12 schools by race can improve the educational and adulthood outcomes of Black students without any negative consequence for White youth (====, Guryan, 2004; Johnson, 2011). But levels of Black-White isolation across schools have at best stagnated after decades of efforts to integrate (Reardon and Owens, 2014). Positive effects also appear to stem from the more equitable distribution of school resources (Johnson, 2011; Reber, 2011), which can be directly achieved through other policies (====, school finance reforms) that arguably face fewer social, political, and judicial barriers. Furthermore, Black communities often carry a disproportionate burden during efforts to reduce racial isolation in schools–Black teachers lose jobs, Black schools are closed, and Black students are the ones bused to desegregated schools (Schofield, 1991; Thompson, 2020). To maximize integration's positive contributions towards equity, school district leaders should thus fully understand and attempt to mitigate potential negative consequences of integrating when doing so.====In this study, I investigate how court-ordered school integration impacts two outcomes that have been understudied in this literature but contribute to observed educational inequalities in the present day: student suspensions and special education identification. I focus on a set of the largest districts in the country that were mandated by courts to racially desegregate schools following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ==== (1954), and I analyze data on outcomes directly reported by these districts from the 1970s and 1980s. To recover causal effects, I use difference-in-differences (DiD) and explore the changes in suspension and special education rates between Black and White students in desegregating districts to those in a set of comparison districts that are never under a court order.====My analyses contribute three main findings. First, I show that though suspension rates are rising for all students in the period of court-mandated school integration following ==== during the 1970s and 1980s,==== rates increase faster in desegregating districts relative to comparison districts. Notably, changes in suspension rates for Black students are over double those of their White peers. Because I employ a quasi-experimental strategy and identify statistically significant differences, this study provides the first causal evidence that certain populations are negatively affected on this key educational measure—school suspensions—that contributes to worse outcomes in adulthood (====, Bacher-Hicks et al., 2020). Exploratory descriptive analyses suggest my results do not directly contradict prior research showing overall positive effects of historic court-mandated integration for Black youth. However, educational leaders pushing more contemporary efforts to desegregate schools should be cautious of the potential for increased categorical inequality as a result.====Second, I find that relative to students in comparison districts, students in desegregating districts are classified as having an intellectual disability at higher rates, with impacts again being concentrated for Black students in particular. These results, however, are less robust than those for suspension rates, and effects are smaller in absolute terms. This study thus yields some evidence that integration leads to differences in the special education identification for Black and White students and provides support for conclusions from the one prior study that I am aware of that investigates this topic causally. Bergman (2018) specifically shows that a more recent cohort of minority students participating in an inter-district integration program are substantially more likely to be classified as needing special education services.====Third, I successfully replicate results from prior work investigating the impact of court-mandated desegregation on levels of school integration (====, Reber, 2005; Welch and Light, 1987) but use a more robust identification strategy. These previous studies similarly use DiD to recover causal effects, but specifically rely on comparing levels of racial isolation between only those districts that are mandated by courts to integrate at different times. Recent advances in econometric theory on approaches that leverage staggered treatment timing for quasi-experimental variation have argued that DiD estimates may be biased if treatment effects change monotonically over time and/or if effects vary across the observations that experience treatment at different times (Baker et al., 2021; Callaway and Sant'Anna, 2020; Goodman-Bacon, 2018). By using a stacked DiD approach (see also Cengiz et al., 2019, Deshpande and Li, 2019), I compare integrating districts to only those never under court mandate and avoid these sources of bias. Reassuringly, I continue to find that court orders substantially equalize the racial composition of schools within a district and increase the exposure of White students to Black students.====My results speak specifically to two larger bodies of research. First, as noted earlier, prior work shows that school integration following ==== decreased the dropout rates of Black students (Guryan, 2004) and improved their labor market and health outcomes (Johnson, 2011). My study is the first to causally identify how student suspensions and special education classification changed during this period when schooling across the U.S. was radically altered. My study also builds on extant literature investigating how schools reproduce inequality by creating and sorting students into different categories, as seen by the disproportionate receipt of school discipline and special education by race (Domina et al., 2017; Shores et al., 2020). Research shows, for example, that Black students are suspended 1.5 times more often than their White peers—even after accounting for key confounding covariates, including racial disparities in income (Shores et al., 2020). Receipt of special education also exhibits disproportionality by race, and inequalities for both have existed for decades (Fish, 2019; Gordon, 2018).====School discipline and special education classification might affect students’ outcomes following school desegregation through several pathways. These countervailing factors may lead to overall positive effects of integration (====, Guryan, 2004, Johnson 2011) even if suspension and special education classification rates only negatively impact Black youth. For example, integration might create opportunities for positive interaction between Black and White youth in schools. Social scientists in support of the Supreme Court's decision in ==== hoped that the ruling would ultimately improve outgroup racial attitudes, which the contact theory of psychology (Allport, 1954) predicts can happen when Black and White individuals more frequently interact with one another. Indeed, one recent study on school resegregation found evidence in support of this hypothesis (Billings et al., 2021). Addressing individuals’ prejudices and biases—particularly those held by White Americans towards Blacks—can subsequently increase racial equity in schools as well in society more broadly (Charles and Guryan, 2008). If, however, Black and White students in “integrated” settings continue to be separated—for example, if students are suspended from school and/or if they are sorted into different classrooms within schools based on programmatic needs resulting from students’ special education classification—Black-White contact would be less pervasive than predicted, and the theoretical benefits of intergroup interaction would be less likely to accrue.====Youth who are disciplined may also be negatively impacted in the long-term if being suspended or expelled results in being labeled as delinquent and increases exposure to other at-risk peers or to the criminal justice system (====, the school-to-prison pipeline, Bacher-Hicks et al., 2020). Others in the classroom, however, may benefit if discipline removes disruptive students and increases perceptions of school safety. The potential consequences of being classified as needing special education is similarly uncertain. On the one hand, classification may provide students with supports necessary to learn in schools. Hanushek et al. (2002) provide some evidence for this, finding that special education classification increases students’ achievement. On the other hand, the stigma of classification, in addition to the isolation from other students and higher quality teachers or curricular materials often associated with special education receipt (Fish, 2019), may lead to negative outcomes in the long run. Furthermore, significant heterogeneity in the different categories of educational disabilities combined with racial differences in categorization may compound existing inequalities. Being identified as having an emotional disturbance or intellectual disability, for example, may lead to even more acute exclusion and stigma for students (Fish, 2019).====There are several reasons to believe that reducing racial isolation in schools through integration could lead to changes in student suspensions and special education classification. Given data limitations, testing the mechanisms behind any observed effects is beyond the scope of this paper. But it is worth highlighting that several case studies conducted after ==== found greater disparities for these outcomes in districts after integration (Children’s Defense Fund, 1975; Eyler et al., 1982; Larkin, 1979; Schofield, 1989; Thornton and Trent, 1988). The potential for these observational results to reflect discriminatory behaviors may have contributed to the expansion by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in their school district data collection efforts to include measures of school discipline and special education classification, which contribute to “second generation” segregation (Eyler et al., 1982; Office of Civil Rights, 1982). Some groups seeing the suggestive evidence of racial disparities during the period of court-mandated integration called for more federal involvement to remedy them (Children’s Defense Fund, 1975) but, as noted earlier, Black-White differences in suspension and special education rates persist to this day, and one investigation finds that the OCR responds to only a minority of complaints related to discriminatory discipline (Perera, 2021). Finally, more contemporary empirical research shows larger Black-White disciplinary inequalities in segregated contexts (Shores et al., 2020) and that Black students are overidentified for special education in schools with more White students (Elder et al., 2021), especially for categories of disability that confer “lower status” (Fish, 2019). With respect to special education receipt, these authors argue that classification may increase in integrated schools because Black students are more distinct from their peers.====School desegregation could relate to school discipline and special education classification through several other channels. First, if predominantly Black schools are underfunded relative to their White counterparts, special education rates might be lower because fewer resources are available to spend on necessary programming. Suspension rates might be higher if Black students and their parents feel disenfranchised by institutional efforts to isolate them (Reardon and Owens, 2014). But theoretically, inequalities may also arise because of integration. Following ====, many Black teachers lost their jobs when schools integrated (Thompson, 2020), and we know that Black students receive exclusionary discipline at lower rates when they are taught by Black teachers (Lindsay and Hart, 2017).==== This “race-match” effect may be potentially due to Black teachers having weaker negative implicit and explicit racial attitudes and prejudices towards Blacks overall (Chin et al., 2020). Racial biases might not just influence how educators perceive students’ behaviors when choosing to discipline (Ferguson, 2000; Skiba et al., 2002); they also might affect the evaluation of student work and change expectations such that Black students are overidentified for needing special education programming (Elder et al., 2021; Papageorge et al., 2020; Quinn, 2020).====A more pernicious mechanism than those relying on unconscious processes like implicit racial bias is that educational stakeholders—whether they be teachers, system leaders, or White families—actively push for more exclusionary policies when schools integrate to ensure White students’ access to limited resources (Ferri and Connor, 2005; Fish, 2019). This perspective aligns with the racial threat hypothesis (Key, 1949), which posits that as the relative size of the Black population grows, so does the use of different forms of social control over Black individuals. Some evidence highlights how states and districts in the U.S. South with stronger preferences for school segregation took longer to integrate and were more likely to do so only after court mandate (Cascio et al., 2008). Forced integration in similarly resistant contexts might thus lead to increased suspension and special education classification rates for Black students.====In summary, much research has investigated the impacts of school desegregation. But very few studies provide direct causal evidence on whether reducing racial isolation between schools impacts the key outcomes of student suspension and special education classification, even though prior empirical work and theory put forth myriad reasons for why integration and exclusionary school policies may be linked. In the following text, I first describe the data, sample, and empirical strategy I use to fill this gap in the literature. I then share results from my investigation of the impact of school desegregation following ==== on Black-White disparities in school suspension and special education classification rates before concluding.",JUE Insight: Desegregated but still separated?

To date, the existing literature provides no evidence that these laws are effective at deterring gun crime, a conclusion that has prompted the National Rifle Association to assert that such regulations are “unnecessary” and “ineffective.” Using data from the FBI's ==== for the period 1985–2013, we find that child access prevention (CAP) laws are associated with a 17 percent reduction in firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles. The estimated effect is stronger among whites than nonwhites and is driven by states enforcing the strictest safe-storage standard. We find no evidence that CAP laws are associated with firearm-related homicides committed by adults or with non-firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles, suggesting that the observed relationship between CAP laws and juvenile firearm-related homicides is causal.","One of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history recently intensified public discussion over the safe storage of firearms after it was learned that the guns were taken from the shooter's home and belonged to his father (Coaston 2018; Mann 2018).==== This comes at a time of rising youth gun violence and increasing public support for gun restrictions.==== For instance, a 2017 U.S. survey found that approximately 60 percent of gun owners backed safe-storage requirements for guns in households with children (Barry et al., 2018).==== As states grapple with decisions on gun control, Americans prefer child access prevention (CAP) laws to more divisive policies such as bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines (Ingraham 2018).====CAP laws encourage the safe storage of firearms by imposing liability on adults who allow children unsupervised access to guns (Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence 2018a). Gun safety advocates support CAP laws as a way to limit firearm-related homicides, as well as a way to decrease unintentional shootings and suicides among minors (Jones 2017; Iannelli 2018). On the other hand, critics argue that safe-storage requirements impede a person's ability to defend their home and family during a violent intrusion, and that these laws may actually increase incidences of murders, rapes, robberies, and other forms of violent crime (Kopel et al., 2000).====As public calls for safe storage grow louder, it is likely that an increasing number of state legislatures will come under pressure to pass CAP laws or toughen their existing CAP requirements. In fact, New York lawmakers passed a bill in March 2019 to require “gun owners who live with someone under 16, or who know that someone under that age could access their gun, to lock up their firearm when it is not in use” (Wang 2019, para. 4). One of the few municipal-level ordinances requiring the safe storage of firearms passed in Seattle, Washington on July 9, 2018 (Norimine 2018).==== Recent estimates suggest that 7 percent of U.S. children (≈ 4.6 million) live in homes with an unlocked and loaded firearm (Azrael et al., 2018).====Uniformly, the existing literature finds no statistically significant evidence that CAP laws reduce violent crime (Cummings et al., 1997; Lott and Whitley 2001; Lott 2003; DeSimone et al., 2013; Anderson and Sabia 2018).==== Referencing Lott and Whitley (2001), the National Rifle Association has claimed that CAP laws are “unnecessary, ineffective, and endanger law-abiding gun owners” (Mortensen 2017, para. 2). We challenge this claim by providing evidence that CAP laws effectively deter gun crime among juveniles.====Using the FBI's ==== (SHR), this study is the first to explore the relationship between CAP laws and homicides committed by juveniles where a firearm was used in the commission of the crime. We focus on homicides, rather than other forms of violent crime, because information on the offender's age is available and the laws are intended to affect households where one or more juveniles are present. Examining the period 1985–2013, a span when 26 states and the District of Columbia adopted CAP legislation, our estimates suggest that CAP laws are associated with a 17 percent reduction in the expected number of firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles, and this effect is driven by states enforcing a “negligent storage” standard, the strictest form of CAP legislation. Furthermore, we find that CAP laws are not associated with firearm-related homicides committed by adults nor are they associated with non-firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles, providing evidence that the relationship between CAP laws and juvenile firearm-related homicides is causal.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide background on CAP laws and review the literature; in Section 3, we describe our data and methods; and in Section 4 we report our results and explore a potential mechanism through which CAP laws may affect juvenile firearm-related homicides, namely gun ownership.

We then explore how the routine intensity of jobs affects the urban wage premium. We find that the urban wage premium is higher for workers performing non-routine tasks, particularly analytic tasks, while it is absent for workers in routine task intensive jobs. These findings also hold ","Mainly through automation, the asymmetric impact of technological developments in labour markets – known as Routine-Biased Technological Change (RBTC) (Autor et al., 2003) – has led to an increase in employment in analytic and manual task intensive occupations, and to a decrease in those occupations requiring routine tasks. Workers performing analytic tasks, in addition to enjoying a comparative advantage in adapting to new technologies, benefit from higher returns to analytic tasks (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018). Following Acemoglu and Autor (2011), in this paper, tasks are defined as a unit of work activity required to produce certain outputs, while skills refer to a formal degree of education obtained by a worker.====The complementarity between analytic tasks and technological change is likely to further disadvantage workers undertaking routine tasks once the location of economic activity is taken into account. This occurs because denser areas, which provide a large supply of specialised, high-skilled workers, offer relatively fewer jobs that are routine task intensive (see Autor, 2019, Davis, Mengus, Michalski, 2020, on the geography of polarisation in the U.S. and in France, respectively). Michaels et al. (2016), for example, show that non-routine occupations are much more likely to be performed in metro areas in 2000 in the U.S (which is confirmed by Ehrl, Monteiro Monasterio, 2016, Ehrl, Monteiro Monasterio, 2016 for Brazil and by Grujovic, 2018, Grujovic, 2018 for Germany). Similar to Michaels et al. (2016) and others, in this study, we confirm a clear negative relationship between employment density and routine task intensity of occupations in the Netherlands. In our analysis, the least routine task intensive occupations, ==== professional services managers and teaching professionals, are exclusively those requiring ==== – encompassing analysing data, thinking creatively, interpretation of information for others and requiring complex personal interactions. By contrast, the most routine task intensive occupations are those that require repetitive and routine tasks such as vehicle and laundry cleaning workers or textile machine operators.====There are three main reasons why occupations and firms that require analytic tasks, in particular, are concentrated in dense urban areas. First, workers that are able to perform analytic tasks may sort themselves into cities. Combes et al. (2008) show that a large part of the variation in spatial wages can be explained by worker characteristics. Davis, Dingel, 2019, Davis, Dingel, 2020 show that larger cities are skill-abundant with greater specialisation in skill-intensive activities. Davis et al. (2020) further show that larger cities have a higher share of highly paid jobs, which at the same time are often more analytic. Second, more productive entrepreneurs and firms may self-select into cities. Behrens et al. (2014) argue that entrepreneurial profit increases with city size; hence, more productive less routine task intensive firms sort themselves into urban areas. Moreover Combes et al. (2012) show that in cities competition is tougher, allowing only the most productive firms to survive. Third, agglomeration economies may foster new idea generation and complementarity among resources, implying that occupations in cities are more task-diverse and less routine task intensive (Bacolod, Blum, Strange, 2009, Lin, 2011, Davis, Dingel, 2019). This relates to the literature which shows that particularly diverse cities are engines of innovation and entrepreneurial activities (Glaeser, Kallal, Scheinkman, Shleifer, 1992, Henderson, Kuncoro, Turner, 1995, Duranton, Puga, 2001, Davis, Dingel, 2020).====In line with the descriptive evidence that urban areas attract more non-routine, particularly analytical workers, we aim to investigate the ====.==== We hypothesise that cities should offer higher returns to analytic task intensive jobs through higher wages and better employment opportunities. Specifically, we argue that the urban wage premia should be heterogeneous across different levels of the routine task intensity index. This is because learning is faster and matching is better among non-routine task intensive jobs. Although our analysis is static in nature, it benefits from the works of Violante (2002) and Beaudry et al. (2016) to explain the firms’ and workers’ potential pace of adaptation to technological change. They argue that with the technological advances taking place, workers at varying levels of task complexity are expected to adapt to the technological improvements at a different pace. The reason for the level of technology adaptation to be variable across jobs is due to the fact that not every firm is at the same level of technology, even though they may be producing similar goods and services. These productivity differentials should then lead to a variation in wage returns as workers undertaking analytic task intensive jobs are more likely to adapt to the technological advances quicker.====Our main contributions are as follows. First and foremost, we combine the literature on agglomeration economies with the literature on routine-biased technological change. Accordingly, we construct a routine task intensity index by using rich linked employer-employee data (LEED) from the Netherlands in 2006–2012. Following Autor and Dorn (2013), Goos et al. (2014), but adapting the O*NET based task measure from SOC to ISCO classification in the Netherlands, we work with a very refined routine task intensity index at the ==== ISCO level.==== Using semi-parametric estimation techniques, we then let agglomeration economies depend on the routine task intensity of jobs.====Second, by using the aggregate distribution of commuting times in the Netherlands, we calculate the number of jobs within the relevant commuting time from the home location of the workers and hence construct a commuting time-weighted employment density measure. The standard measures of density have the disadvantage of being commonly defined on the basis of some legal demarcation rather than labour market dynamics and are subject to the modifiable-areal unit problem (see Briant et al., 2010).====Third, we improve on the identification of agglomeration effects by identifying the effects within labour market areas and controlling for historic sorting of high-skilled workers more than century ago into certain areas within the labour markets. Furthermore, using fine-grained data on the skill composition of jobs in 1909, we determine the share of high-skilled, medium-skilled and low-skilled workers within commuting distance in 1909 and include those as extra controls in the regressions. To investigate whether any remaining ability bias is an issue, we utilise a unique parent-child linkage dataset and hence focus on siblings in our sample to mitigate the issue of unobserved innate ability of workers. This enables us to identify agglomeration effects on the basis of siblings by employment density.====We find that controlling for sorting and mitigating endogeneity issues, there is a sizeable negative effect of employment density on the routine task intensity of jobs, meaning agglomeration economies reduce the routine task intensity of jobs, ==== through creating complex tasks while also expanding new combinations of existing tasks, hence leading to a strong spatial concentration of complex tasks in denser areas. This aligns with the literature arguing that cities are places where new ideas are created and innovations take place (see ==== Davis, Dingel, 2020, Duranton, Puga, 2001, Duranton, Puga, 2004, Lin, 2011). We show that, depending on the complexity of the tasks performed, there is a large variation in the urban wage premium. For example, the wage-density elasticity is approximately 0.15 for workers that are in non-routine jobs, while it is essentially zero for workers in routine task intensive jobs. Moreover, observationally similar workers performing analytic tasks receive a much higher urban wage premium, regardless of their education level. This suggests that only using skills to explain differences in urban premia will be inadequate.====To explain these findings, we provide suggestive evidence on the potential channels, such as better skills matching (==== skills to jobs) and the enhanced learning opportunities cities offer (==== through work experience in the (local) labour market). We show that better matching is only relevant for workers performing analytic tasks. Moreover, learning externalities accrue only to workers in non-routine task intensive jobs with more years of experience in the local labour market. We interpret the latter as circumstantial evidence that learning effects are important in explaining why mostly workers in non-routine task intensive occupations receive density premia.==== Our paper first ties into a vast literature on agglomeration economies, that assumes higher productivity and wages in dense places (Ciccone, Hall, 1996, Ciccone, 2002, Combes, Duranton, Gobillon, 2008, Melo, Graham, Noland, 2009). Traditionally, the density premium is assumed to percolate across all skill groups proportional to city size, hence independent of workers’ skill or tasks they perform.==== This proposition suggests that the urban wage premium will homogeneously increase in talent with city size and predicts a spatially ==== skill premium (Behrens, Robert-Nicoud, 2015, Davis, Dingel, 2019). This traditional framework commonly uses the observed degree of education as an approximation of unobserved skills (==== a degree premium), rather than a premium that directly relates to the market value of the skills the worker possesses. However, widening wage and skill inequalities within occupational groups – even between observationally similar workers ==== urban areas – warrant further scrutiny to understand the heterogeneity in the urban wage premium, as well as to revisit whether the approximation of workers’ talent with skills sufficiently explains this heterogeneity.====Davis and Dingel (2019) rightfully argue that the canonical spatial-equilibrium model falls short as talent-homogeneous cities cannot rationalise the spatial variation in skill premia. Similarly Black et al. (2009) show that only with homothetic preferences, skill premia can be location-invariant, while with more realistic non-homothetic preferences, skill premia are lower in cities with higher house price. Deviating from the canonical spatial-equilibrium model Davis and Dingel (2019) instead distinguish between tradables and non-tradables producing workers. Tradables producers gain from learning externalities through frequent local interactions (==== idea exchanges). The resulting spatial sorting of tradables producers and their productivity-increasing idea exchanges in cities provide a strong basis for the polarisation of economic activity across space and higher skill premia observed in denser areas. Note that their model differentiates itself from the earlier spatial equilibrium models by not defining skills by a level of ability linked to an educational degree. This theoretical framework implicitly supports studying ==== rather than skills to analyse heterogeneous productivity gains and is therefore consistent with our findings that the urban wage premium only exists for non-routine task workers.====Our paper is further related to the works of Bacolod et al. (2009) and Grujovic (2018) that have explicitly tested whether agglomeration economies vary with the task content of jobs. Bacolod et al. (2009) find that large cities host more complex jobs than small cities, but only to a modest degree. Unfortunately, their definition of skills required to perform certain tasks is, due to data restrictions, somewhat aggregate. Grujovic (2018) estimates heterogeneous urban wage premium for task content of jobs and ranks the wage returns to tasks on the basis of their complexity.====Another strand of literature that aligns strongly with our findings above is the literature on RBTC, which tries to explain the changing wage structure between skill groups. It focuses on two major sources: ==== automation that led to a hollowing out of the employment in middle-skilled occupations through routine-biased technical change (see Adermon and Gustavsson, 2015, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2015, Autor, Acemoglu, 2011, Goos et al., 2014, Oesch, 2013); and ==== skill-biased technological change (SBTC) that assumes an advantage for high-skilled workers through a strong complementarity between skills and technology (see Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). The so-called canonical model, which does not make an explicit distinction between skills and tasks, implies that the improvements in technology should naturally increase the demand for skilled workers. In recent decades, though, there has been a strong polarisation of jobs through the growth in the share of employment in high and low skilled occupations leading to an increased wage dispersion between and within skill groups. Autor (2019) further refines the implications of job polarisation on the reshaping of work in urban areas: ==== cities have always been more intensive in high-skilled work; ==== although the share of low-skilled work is typically lower in cities, in the last two decades its employment share increased considerably in the densest areas (==== in the U.S. and many other developed countries); ==== since the early 80s there has been a sharp attenuation in the fraction of middle-skilled work in the densest areas. Looking at these patterns in detail, the compositional shift within education groups indicates a profound reallocation of medium-skilled workers from middle to low-skilled work such as services, transportation and labourer occupations, but only in the ====.====Recently, Van der Velde (2017) shows that occupations where tasks performed complement newer technologies exhibit higher wage dispersion. When focused only on the skill levels of workers as opposed to the tasks they perform, the relative differences between wages across occupations remain largely unexplained by the observables, despite controlling for education. This is at odds with the empirical evidence since the technology has impacted the skill groups variably across time and space, leading to job polarisation.====These changes in the structure of work have ==== implications for our paper. Firstly, as Autor (2019) suggests, the link between polarisation, the changing structure of work and wages across geographic locations is to be explored within a framework that allows for the uneven folding of occupational structure in the labour market across locations. Secondly, the downward pressure exerted due to polarisation between occupational skill groups, particularly from the middle to the bottom of the occupational distribution likely gives rise to skills mismatch (Beaudry et al., 2016).====Indeed the empirical studies (Autor, Acemoglu, 2011, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2015) that adopt a task approach to analyse the work content of jobs inevitably allows larger variation in worker productivity, hence leading to a larger wage dispersion, such that even for observationally identical workers wages can vary significantly due to the tasks they perform. We confirm this in our paper as predominantly workers in non-routine task-intensive jobs profit from urban density, regardless of their skill level (==== their formal education).====Given the implications of the literature on RBTC, we try to understand the mechanisms why agglomeration externalities may be task-specific. Duranton and Puga (2004) distinguish between three mechanisms why agglomeration economies arise: learning, matching and sharing.==== We, therefore, expect learning opportunities to be greater in cities (in line with Davis and Dingel, 2019, and RBTC), even more so for non-routine workers due to the diffusion of technologies creating demand for non-routine tasks. However, De la Roca and Puga (2017) show that learning externalities may not be instantaneous but may increase with experience (==== proxied by the time spent in large cities). We will show in Section 4 that agglomeration economies are absent for inexperienced workers even if they are performing analytic intensive tasks. We interpret this as suggestive evidence that time spent in the labour market or in cities is important to exploit learning effects.====Furthermore, as the literature suggests, a better matching of jobs-skills is another externality workers can benefit from in urban areas (Boualam, 2014, Berlingieri, 2019). Since non-routine task-intensive jobs and workers are more clustered in denser areas, we expect cities to provide better matching opportunities, particularly for non-routine workers. To investigate this, in line with Beaudry et al. (2016), we consider two dimensions of skills mismatch, namely vertical mismatch (==== overqualification) and horizontal mismatch.====We measure matching through overqualification due to the potential of technological change to increase overqualification.==== It is argued that due to automation and offshoring hollowing out certain types of jobs (regardless of skill level though mostly those in the middle-skilled occupations), overqualification is likely to increase. This is because the qualified workers who lose their jobs or have fewer employment opportunities and also have less opportunity to upskill instantaneously, either exit the labour market or go down the occupational ladder. For instance, Autor (2019) points out that the compositional shift within education groups indicates a profound reallocation of middle-skilled workers in urban metros from middle to work requiring low skills, such as services, transportation and labourer occupations in the ====. This downward pressure exerted by higher-skilled occupation workers towards lower skilled ones is a likely mechanism to increase the overqualification in labour markets.==== Given the compelling nature of routinisation towards rising skills mismatch, we analyse statically whether thick urban labour markets help improve matching. The effect of employment density on overqualification is indeed negative, suggesting better skills-jobs matching in cities, but only for non-routine workers.====RBTC implies that the wage gap between non-routine and routine task intensive jobs become wider once technological change is taken into account. We show that this effect will be reinforced in cities, and will be most pronounced for workers performing analytic jobs through a density premium. This wage-density premium may be explained by better skills-to-jobs matching and learning externalities for workers in non-routine task intensive jobs. Hence, wage inequalities seem to be wider in cities due to routine task intensity of jobs. Therefore, the heterogeneous effect of agglomeration economies does not necessarily operate through skill levels, but more so via task complexity.====The paper continues as follows. In Section 2 we outline our research framework, including a discussion on the data used, descriptive statistics, and the econometric framework. Section 3 reports the results, while Section 4 studies the mechanisms why the urban wage premium only pertains to workers in non routine task intensive jobs.

This event involved expulsion of ethnic Germans and an almost complete depopulation of an area of a country and its rapid resettlement by 2 million Czech inhabitants. Results based on a ==== show a highly persistent higher population churn and thus a lower attachment of residents to their region in resettled areas. Descriptive evidence also indicates that resettled settlements still have fewer local club memberships, less frequently organize local social events and had lower turnout in municipal elections until the 1990s. This thus suggests persistently lower levels of local social capital. This finding is consistent with recent theoretical models that suggest a highly persistent impact of the destruction of local social capital on residential migration.","A growing body of economic and political science research documents that the disruption of social structures caused by forced mass emigration has long-lasting and sizeable effects on the political attitudes (Acemoglu, Hassan, Robinson, 2011, Grosfeld, Rodnyansky, Zhuravskaya, 2013), institutional, economic and educational outcomes (Acemoglu, Hassan, Robinson, 2011, Akbulut-Yuksel, Yuksel, 2015, Pascali, 2016, Bharadwaj, Khwaja, Mian, 2008, Testa, 2020) and scientific achievements (Waldinger, 2010, Waldinger, 2011) of the affected regions as well as on the forced migrants and their descendants (Becker et al., 2020). This literature (see: Becker and Ferrara, 2019, for a survey) suggests that these impacts are substantially more long-lasting and sizeable than those found in the related literature on the destruction of physical capital (Brakman, Garretsen, Schramm, 2004, Waldinger, 2016). The long-run demographic impact of mass emigration has so far been much less analyzed. Among the exceptions Schumann (2014) focuses on population growth in a receiving region to provide evidence of a highly persistent demographic impact of the mass immigration to West Germany after World War II. The current paper adds to this literature by using the post-WWII mass expulsion of ethnic Germans from the area of today’s Czech Republic (the so-called Sudetenland) to study the long-term impact of the subsequent resettlement on migration to and from the resettled regions.====This focus may be interesting because migration is generally seen as a behavioural measure of the attractiveness of a region as a place of residence and the attachment of its population to the region (see e.g.: Greenwood et al., 1991). It may, also be interesting because the expulsion and subsequent resettlement we study resulted in an almost complete destruction of the social structures and networks in the affected region. Recent theoretical contributions to the social capital literature (see e.g., David, Janiak, Wasmer, 2010, Bräuninger, Tolciu, 2011) suggest that such large shocks may have highly persistent effects on the attachment of residents to the region. In these models there are typically two stable long-run equilibria: One with low and one with high local social capital. Furthermore, since individuals derive utility from income and social capital they may forego financially profitable mobility to enjoy their social contacts in the region of residence. As a consequence, the high local social capital equilibrium is associated with low mobility, and the low local social capital equilibrium with high mobility. A sufficiently large shock to local social capital can move regions from one of these equilibria to the other, thereby causing a persistent change in migration rates from and to a region that goes hand in hand with persistent shift in local social capital levels.====The empirical part of this literature confirms this strong impact of current and previous social contacts for mobility and suggests that in particular local contacts are an impediment to mobility, while contacts to other regions enhance it. For example Kan (2007) and Belot and Ermisch (2009) show that people with contacts in their region of residence are less inclined to move elsewhere, while Büchel et al. (2020) show that mobile individuals prefer to live in places with more nearby contacts. This literature, however, considers the contemporaneous correlation between social capital and migration (i.e. the short-run). Yet recent evidence by Costa et al. (2018) also indicates a persistent long-run impact impact of social contacts on individual’s location decisions, as civil war veterans serving in the same military unit tend to live close to each other in the long-run. We therefore add to this literature by analyzing the long-run impact of the resettlement of the Sudetenland, which caused an almost complete destruction of the social structures and networks, on mobility and presenting additional descriptive evidence on the long-run development of local social capital levels in the resettled municipalities.====The resettlement of the Sudetenland is particularly well suited to identify such long-run impacts due to the size of the population exchange, the extraordinary speed with which ethnic Germans had to leave and the rapid resettlement that occurred in the follow-up. In the municipalities we study at least 90% of the population were ethnic Germans, who were subjected to expulsion and by and large completely replaced by Czech speaking settlers within five years. With the exodus of the German speakers also all local social networks and contacts of the resident population were destroyed and the newly arriving population had to re-establish all social contacts anew. This provides for large scale and credibly exogenous shock to local social capital in the affected region. In addition the fleeing population had to leave behind all of their belongings as well as all physical capital, and was rapidly replaced by settlers, who mostly came from other parts of the Czech Republic and took possession of the belongings and physical capital left behind. This limits the role of some potential explanations such as physical capital destruction or cultural or institutional differences, which have been emphasized as alternative sources for long-term differences in regional development in previous research (Grosfeld, Rodnyansky, Zhuravskaya, 2013, Becker, Boeckh, Hainz, Woessmann, 2015, Dell, 2010, Alesina, Giuliano, 2015).====Finally, this paper also contributes to the still rather scant literature on the resettlement of the Sudetenland (see e.g., Daněk, 1995, Testa, 2020). Earlier work on this resettlement (Daněk, 1995) used descriptive evidence on the district level to show that districts of the Czech Republic that were at least partially located in the Sudetenland, still have a younger, less well educated, more secularized and ethnically more diverse population than other districts of today’s Czech Republic. More recently, Testa (2020), in the paper most closely related to this one, uses municipality level data and a spatial regression discontinuity design based on the borders drawn by the Munich Agreement, to show that former German municipalities still had a lower population density, higher rates of unemployment, less skill-intensive industries, and lower levels of education in 2011. He argues that a lack of agglomeration economies and the erosion of property rights caused by resettlement are potential mechanisms that may have caused these differences. We augment these findings by a detailed analysis of the impact of resettlement on migration and by proposing an additional causal mechanism that may have contributed to these very long-run impacts.====We combine a unique municipality-level administrative data set that includes all permanent residence changes in the years 1971 to 2015 with pre-WWII municipality-level data on the ethnic composition of municipalities in 1930. This allows us to identify the causal effects of resettlement on residential migration by comparing the most strongly affected municipalities with more than 90% ethnic Germans in 1930 (which we refer to as ====) to municipalities with less than 10% ethnic German residents in 1930 (referred to as ====). We use a regression discontinuity (RD) design identification strategy where the inference is based on a precise definition of the border between ethnic German- and Czech-dominated areas before WWII. The results indicate that resettlement led to a long-lasting increase in residential migration to and from the resettled municipalities that survived such important institutional changes as the transition from a planned to a market economy, the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and accession to the European Union, and the many economic changes that occurred in the Czech Republic in that period. Even at the end of our observation period, in 2015 (i.e., 70 years after the resettlement), emigration and immigration rates in resettled municipalities were still substantially (by around 20%) higher than among not resettled municipalities. In addition, at the beginning of the period studied the effects of resettlement on emigration dominate over those on immigration, such that net emigration from resettled municipalities initially increased as well. This effect, however, levels off to zero after the mid-1980s, and is also less robust than the effect on gross-emigration and immigration rates. This suggests that—consistent with theoretical predictions—resettlement mainly resulted in a very long-run reduction in the attachment of the population to the affected regions.====To provide additional descriptive evidence on the potential causal mechanisms for this long-run impact we analyze auxiliary data sets. We explore two mechanisms. The first one assumes that the original settlers moving into the Sudetenland belonged to the more mobile groups of the population at the time of resettlement and may have transferred their values related to mobility to their children, who are the migrants we study at the end of our observation period. The second is based on the assumption that resettlement led to a persistent large scale reduction in local social capital of the resettled territory, and thus moved these regions from the high social capital, low mobility to the low local social capital, high mobility equilibrium suggested by the theoretical literature.====These analyses show that the population in the resettled and not resettled municipalities share similar mobility related values and also do not differ in terms of their behaviour with respect to proxy variables for social capital that is not clearly bound to the locality (such as their inclination to give donations to national organisations, as well as their willingness to attend social events and to participate in voluntary work potentially outside their region of residence). We, however, find evidence that resettled municipalities had lower turnout rates in municipal elections up to the 1990s and have fewer local activities and clubs as well as lower membership levels in local clubs to this day. This suggests that local social capital is less well developed in the resettled regions. While therefore we cannot fully preclude some role for the parental transmission mechanism in explaining the long run impact of resettlement on migration decisions, we argue that—consistent with many of the descriptions of these municipalities by historians (Čapka et al., 2005, Glassheim, 2006, Matějka, 2008, Spurný, 2011, Vaněk, 1996) and with theoretical models of the impact of local social capital on migration decisions—persistently lower local social capital in resettled municipalities is likely to have at least contributed to the persistently higher residential in- and out-migration in these municipalities.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

This is highlighted by the $800,000+ average house values reported by the ==== (====) in the San Francisco and San Jose metropolitan areas in 2019, which many highly-skilled and well-remunerated workers cannot afford based on standard lending guidelines that limit price-to-income ratios below four in the absence of substantial down payments.====Previous research has investigated the role of supply-side constraints on the ability to deliver additional housing units to the market in accounting for high prices (e.g., see Glaeser and Gyourko, (2018) for a recent example). In this paper, we present new estimates of the impact of restrictive residential land use regulation on single family housing land prices across major markets in the United States. Conceptually, our approach is similar to that used in previous work, in the sense that the impact of regulatory strictness is measured by the gap between the extensive and intensive margin values of land used for single-family home development. The idea is that in a completely unregulated market, there should be no difference in the value that an existing homeowner or homebuilder places on an extra square foot of land. That is, if the value an existing homeowner puts on having a bit more land (i.e., the intensive margin value) is less than that a builder places on the same amount of land with the right to build on it (the value of land on the extensive margin), then the owner-occupier should subdivide and sell out to the builder. Unless there are regulations preventing that increase in density, there should be no gap between land values on the intensive and extensive margins. This arbitrage condition holds regardless of the forces that might be driving up the prices developers are willing to pay on the extensive margin for vacant land with the right to build single-family product on it. However, if there are binding limits on the ability of existing owners to subdivide and sell to those paying more per square foot on the extensive margin, then there would be a gap between extensive and intensive margin values. In that case, land prices on the extensive margin would be bid up until there were no unexploited profit opportunities left for builders in the more strictly regulated housing markets.==== This gap between extensive and intensive margin land values has been called the ‘zoning tax’ in previous research (Glaeser and Gyourko, 2003, 2018).====Our new and updated estimates of zoning taxes rely on proprietary vacant land parcel transactions purchased from CoStar, a well-known data provider to the real estate industry. Its data has been used in other work, so it is known to the urban research community.==== However, its data have not been used for our specific purpose. This source provides direct observation of prices paid for individual parcels of vacant land purchased with the intention of supplying single family housing units, something that has not been available in previous work on this topic. This provides two important benefits. As we discuss more fully in the next section, not only does this reduce measurement error associated with computing the zoning tax, but the specific location of each parcel is known so that we can investigate spatial variation in price effects within a metropolitan area for the first time. Another benefit is that the data, which are from the 2013 to 2018 time period, provide the most recent picture of the impact on supply constraints on land values in the literature.====We report zoning taxes in 24 major metropolitan areas across the United States. The typical gap between extensive and intensive margin land values of a quarter acre plot of land is about $400,000 in the San Francisco metro, ranges between $150,000 and $200,000 in three other large coastal markets (Los Angeles, New York City and Seattle), and is over $100,000 in the San Jose metro area. These amounts are from 1 to 4 times the relatively high typical household incomes in these markets, so the likely impact on housing affordability is meaningful. Smaller gaps between extensive and intensive margin land values of $60,000–$80,000 are found in Chicago, Philadelphia, Portland (OR) and Washington, DC. The zoning tax in the Boston market area is just under $50,000 for a standardized quarter acre lot. Differences of $35,000–$40,000 per quarter acre lot are estimated for the Miami (FL) and Riverside-San Bernardino markets.==== There is no evidence of an economically meaningful zoning tax for the median observation in a wide range of other markets spread throughout the interior of the United States. Almost none of these latter markets is on a coast, but many are quite large and have experienced strong growth in demand (e.g., Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Deltona (FL), Denver, Nashville, Orlando and Phoenix). Hence, the absence of meaningful zoning taxes is not restricted to declining markets in the Rust Belt (e.g., Cincinnati and Detroit).====Our findings are qualitatively consistent with previous research that also finds the largest gaps between extensive and intensive margin land values in the nation's major coastal markets. Especially big effects in west coast markets are consistent with newly available indexes of regulatory strictness (Gyourko et al, 2019). Later in the paper, we explore this new measure of regulatory restrictiveness which shows the San Francisco area housing market to be the most strictly regulated in the country, while Atlanta's is slightly below average in terms of restrictiveness. That metric, the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index for 2018 (WRLURI2018), is increasing in the degree of supply side constraint imposed. WRLURI2018 is strongly positively correlated with house prices as documented in Fig. 1’s plot of house prices from the 2017 ==== for the 24 major markets that we study below against each market's 2018 regulatory index value. The fitted OLS linear regression line implies that a 1.3-unit increase in regulatory index value (which equals a 1.3 standard deviation difference in regulatory strictness in San Francisco versus Atlanta in their data) is associated with just over a $400,000 gap in prices between San Francisco and Atlanta. Nothing causal is implied by this simple bivariate regression, of course.====However, the basic price theory underlying the gap between extensive and intensive margin prices suggests that the magnitude of our zoning tax estimates should be increasing with the actual degree of regulatory strictness in the market. We document this to be the case by showing that our estimated zoning taxes are strongly positively correlated with WRLURI2018 index values, too (see Fig. 7 below). This relationship is not mechanically driven as the regulatory index is created from survey data that does not use land or house prices in any way in its construction. This suggests there actually is a causal relationship plotted in Fig. 1, with the pathway running from binding supply-side restrictions to a higher price of residential land paid by builders who supply costlier homes to higher market-wide house prices.====Our new analysis of the spatial variation within markets helps highlight how different and unique are the three large west coast markets of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. For this part of the analysis, we divided each CBSA into three zones: (a) near-in, which includes all parcels within 15 miles of the metro urban core; (b) middle, which includes all parcels within 15–30 miles of the metro core; and (c) farther-out, which includes all parcels more than 30 miles out from the metro core. Land is expensive everywhere within these three labor market areas, with there being little difference in the typical zoning tax among ‘near-in’ versus ‘farther-out’ parcels. What makes the other two markets of New York City and San Jose that also had very high median zoning taxes of at least $100,000 per quarter acre different is that it is possible to find parcels farther out from their metro cores with zoning tax amounts that are fractions of, not multiples of, typical household income. No other metro area approaches the three large west coast markets in this regard.====The plan of the paper is as follows. Section II outlines a simple model underpinning our interpretation of a gap between extensive and intensive margin land valuations as evidence of binding supply side regulation. This section also describes the different data sources used in our estimations. Section III then reports our baseline results, and documents heterogeneity by distance from the urban core within each metropolitan area. This section ends by relating our zoning tax estimates to the measure of regulatory restrictiveness from the new Wharton index. Section IV discusses the broader implications of our results for the future study of how housing markets likely are changed by the presence of zoning taxes.",The impact of local residential land use restrictions on land values across and within single family housing markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000565,1 July 2021,2021,Research Article,44.0

In this paper, we use the 2000 Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) to value climate amenities using both methods. We compare estimates of marginal ==== (MWTP), allowing preferences for climate amenities to vary by location. We find that mean MWTP for warmer winters is about twice as large using the discrete choice approach as with the hedonic approach; mean MWTP for cooler summers is approximately the same. The two approaches differ, however, in their estimates of MWTP by location. These disparities lead to significant differences in estimates of ==== to avoid the A2 and B1 SRES scenarios in 2020–2050 using the two approaches.","To value amenities that vary across cities, researchers have typically followed one of two approaches. They have used either hedonic models of wages and housing prices (Roback 1982; Blomquist et al., 1988; Albouy et al., 2016) or discrete models of location choice (Cragg and Kahn 1997; Bayer et al., 2009; Fan et al., 2016; Sinha et al., 2018b). The former approach infers willingness to pay for amenities by estimating hedonic price functions for wages and housing costs as a function of location-specific attributes; the second, by estimating the probability that consumers choose a city in which to live as a function of wages, housing prices, and location-specific attributes.====Cragg and Kahn (1997), Bayer et al. (2009), and Sinha et al. (2018b) note that the discrete choice approach typically produces estimates of amenity values that are very different from estimates produced by the continuous hedonic approach. In a discrete choice model where households choose the US state in which to reside, Cragg and Kahn (1997) find the marginal willingness to pay for July and February temperatures exceeds the marginal prices implied by hedonic price functions. Bayer et al. (2009) estimate marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) to reduce air pollution using a discrete choice approach and find MWTP is three times greater than values capitalized into per capita incomes and property values. In their discrete choice model, Sinha et al. (2018b) estimate higher damages associated with projected climate changes in US cities under the A2 scenario in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios than comparable estimates from Albouy et al. (2016) hedonic model.====In this paper, we use the same dataset to value climate amenities—specifically, winter and summer temperature—using hedonic and discrete choice methods. We compare estimates from each approach, allowing preferences for climate amenities to vary by location. Similar to Albouy (2012), our hedonic models regress the weighted sum of wage and housing price indices on climate amenities and various city characteristics using metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) as the geographic unit. Wage and housing price indices are estimated, following Albouy et al. (2016), assuming national labor and housing markets. We construct a weighted sum of wage and housing price indices for each MSA using the same weights as in Albouy et al. (2016) and, alternately, using a traditional set of weights (Roback 1982). We capture preference heterogeneity by allowing the marginal price of climate amenities to vary by city using local linear regressions, in the spirit of Bajari and Benkard (2005) and Bajari and Kahn (2005).====In discrete location choice models, consumers choose among MSAs based on predicted wages and housing costs, moving costs from birthplace, and the same set of location-specific amenities as used in the hedonic models. To capture heterogeneity in preferences, we estimate random parameter logit models and calculate the distribution of each household's tastes for climate conditional on the city in which they live. This allows us to estimate mean MWTP for climate amenities by city.====We focus on prime-aged households when comparing the two approaches. Because the hedonic approach assumes that amenities are capitalized into wages, and because a significant fraction of older households have no wage income, Albouy et al. (2016) focus on workers aged 25–55. We have estimated discrete location choice models for various age groups (Sinha et al., 2018b) and find that preferences for climate amenities vary by the age of the household head; however, we focus on households with heads between 25 and 55 when comparing discrete choice with hedonic estimates.====We find that the two approaches produce different estimates of mean MWTP for winter and summer temperature and different estimates of MWTP by location when we allow preferences to vary across cities. Although both approaches find that households have positive MWTP for warmer winters and cooler summers, mean estimates of MWTP for winter temperature produced by the discrete choice approach are about twice as large as estimates produced by the hedonic approach. Moreover, the two approaches produce different variation in MWTP by city. The discrete choice model finds that households living in warmer areas have a higher MWTP for winter temperature: there is a strong positive correlation between winter temperature and MWTP for warmer winters. The discrete choice model thus projects that under most climate scenarios, the parts of the country that will benefit from warmer winters (the Northeast and Midwest) value this less than the average US household. When we use the two sets of MWTP estimates to value the A2 and B1 SRES climate scenarios in 2020–2050 we find that the value of avoiding each scenario is about twice as high using the hedonic than using the discrete choice approach.====We also explore why estimates produced by the two approaches vary. One reason is that the hedonic and discrete choice models as typically applied differ in their underlying assumptions about consumer mobility. The hedonic approach as characterized by Roback (1982) assumes perfect mobility, whereas moving costs are more easily incorporated in discrete models of location choice. As Bayer et al. (2009) note, moving costs—both psychological and out-of-pocket—may prevent amenities from being fully capitalized into wages and housing values. When we estimate the discrete choice model without moving costs, the value of climate amenities falls significantly. It is also the case that moving costs, which vary by household and city, help identify variation in MWTP across cities in the discrete choice model (Berry and Haile 2010). When they are removed, the ordering of MWTP by city is (incorrectly) reversed.====A related reason for differences in the two sets of estimates is the way in which data on wages and housing prices are used. The hedonic model assumes a single national labor market and a single housing market. The data are used to estimate price indices for each MSA, assuming that the returns to human capital and marginal prices of housing characteristics are the same everywhere. The discrete choice model assumes that each MSA constitutes a separate labor and a separate housing market. It is the variation in wage income and housing costs across MSAs, as well as the variation in moving costs across MSAs, that identifies household preferences in the discrete choice model. This suggests that differences in how the two models use information on housing and labor markets may account in part for the difference in estimates.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the hedonic model of amenity valuation as originally developed by Roback (1982) and modified by Albouy (2012) and Albouy et al. (2016). We present the discrete location choice model that we estimate in Section 3 and discuss similarities and differences between the two approaches at the end of this section. In Section 4 we describe our data and empirical specifications. Section 5 presents the results of both modeling approaches.

Masera Federico,"University of New South Wales, Australia","Received 18 November 2019, Revised 20 May 2021, Available online 1 June 2021, Version of Record 12 June 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2021.103365,Cited by (4),"The debate over police use of military equipment often revolves around the supposed tradeoff between increasing police safety and reducing killings by the police. In this paper, I rely on institutional features that exogenously determine the distribution of military equipment to US police departments to show that, contrary to previous evidence, there is no such tradeoff: police militarization increases killings by the police and ==== police safety. Each year police militarization results in 64 additional killings by the police, 12,440 police officer assaults, and 2653 police officer injuries.","Over 1000 people in the US are killed by law enforcement agents each year, with per capita rates that are over 15 times higher than those found in most Western countries.==== These killings are responsible for approximately 8% of all homicides with adult male victims and are especially concentrated in central urban areas (Edwards et al., 2018). In 2014, after a series of high-profile killings by the police, the Obama Administration and Congress started reviewing the equipment and practices used by police departments.==== As a result, President Obama signed an executive order reducing the ability of police departments to acquire and use military equipment. In July 2016, the death of 8 police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge reignited the debate on police militarization, with critics of President Obama’s executive order claiming that militarization is needed for police safety. In line with this argument, President Trump revoked President Obama’s executive order in August 2017.==== In 2020, nationwide protests against the use of force by the police have sparked a reexamination of police militarization.====The extensive policy debate surrounding the supposed tradeoff between police safety and killings by the police when making police militarization decisions has recently sparked substantial academic interest. One strand of the literature intends to estimate the effects of militarization by exploiting the panel structure of the data to control for time-invariant unobservables. Carriere and Encinosa (2017) shows that US states that received more military equipment experienced a decrease in assaults on the police and that this relationship goes in the opposite direction when studying operational militarized items (e.g., sonar or radar). Delehanty et al. (2017) at the county level and Lawson (2018) at the police department level both find a positive relationship between killings by the police and military equipment transferred by federal programs. Mummolo (2018) compares law enforcement agencies before and after receiving a special weapons and tactics team and finds no relationship with officer safety. While controlling for time-invariant characteristics, these studies may still produce biased estimates if militarization decisions are not random. For example, this may be due to police departments getting militarized in response to changes in crime (Ramey and Steidley, 2018).====To solve this issue, another strand of the literature uses an instrumental variable approach that attempts to eliminate biases caused by unobservables that vary over time within a county. Among other results, Bove and Gavrilova (2017) show that counties that tend to receive more military aid experienced no changes in either police safety or the use of deadly force by the police. Harris et al. (2017) show instead show that militarization has no effect on killings by the police and that it increases police safety. Gunderson et al. (2020) using new data at the police department level did not manage to replicate some of the results found in the aforementioned studies. These differences may be due to an ecological fallacy caused by the difference between the treated unit (i.e., police department) and the level at which the analysis was conducted (i.e., county). Steidley and Ramey (2019) express similar concerns regarding Bove and Gavrilova (2017) and Harris et al. (2017), stating that “the effect of military equipment is weak and causality remains questionable.”====I contribute to this debate by improving on previous instrumental variable estimations in three major dimensions. First, I show that previous estimates may be contaminated by factors that simultaneously determine killings by the police, police safety, and militarization decisions. I then propose a new identification strategy to overcome this problem. Second, in order to avoid the ecological fallacy highlighted by Gunderson et al. (2020), I employ data at the police department level. Third, I build a new dataset on killings by the police based on non-governmental information to bypass some well-known problems with official data. Each of these innovations has important implications for the estimated signs and magnitudes of the effects of militarization on police safety and killings by the police. Upon incorporating all of these innovations, I show that police militarization increases killings by the police and reduces police safety.====To estimate the effects of militarization on police safety and police killings I rely on exogenous differences in police militarization determined by institutional features of the 1033 Program; the main federal program that redistributes military equipment to police departments across the US.==== Although this program was created in 1996, it was practically inactive until 2009. Withdrawal from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2010 led to the arrival of vast quantities of military equipment in the US. Much of this equipment, now unused by the military, has been redistributed to police departments via the 1033 Program.====Similar to Harris et al. (2017), I notice that military equipment redistributed by the 1033 Program is made available at storage facilities located at certain military bases. While police departments do not have to pay for the items themselves, because of various institutional features, the effective cost of an item increases with distance to the storage facility housing it. Due to these costs, I expect that, when items became available after withdrawal from the aforementioned wars, police departments closer to these storage facilities became more militarized.====I use this differential change in militarization, combined with the fact that only some military bases were selected as storage facilities, to exogenously predict militarization. I use this as a first stage in an instrumental variable setting to then estimate the effects of militarization. With this identification strategy I compare changes in the outcomes of police departments equally distant to a military base, but that differ in terms of their distance from a 1033 Program storage facility. This identification strategy has been previously used in Masera (2021) to study the effects of the militarization of the police through the 1033 Program on violent crime. The identifying assumption is that changes in the outcomes of interest between police departments close to a military base with or without a 1033 Program storage facility would have been the same had it not been for their differential militarization. In this regard, I show that for the purposes of the instrumental variable estimation, the selection of military bases can be considered as good as random. More specifically, I demonstrate that police departments close to 1033 Program storage facilities and those close to other military bases were similar in terms of levels and trends of many observables before the withdrawal from the wars.====I then construct a new panel dataset on killings by the police at the police department level using the Fatal Encounters database (====). This information allows me to solve the non-random reporting and systematic underrepresentation of this phenomenon observed in official datasets. I use this information to show that militarization increases killings by the police with a firearm, while it does not affect other types of killings. The estimates indicate that after 2010, 8.4% of the killings by firearm were due to the militarization of the police, which is, equivalent to an additional 64 killings by the police each year. The effects of militarization on killings by the police estimated here are in line with the arguments proposed by Lawson (2018) and Delehanty et al. (2017), who claim that militarization may increase killings by the police by making errors committed by the police more likely to be fatal and by generating a more aggressive culture within police departments.====I then use the FBI’s “Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted” (LEOKA) dataset to show that the militarization of the police has reduced the safety of police officers. The estimates imply that, since the start of the withdrawal from the wars, militarization has caused 15.9% of the assaults and 12.8% of the injuries of police officers. In this period, militarization resulted in an extra 12,440 assaults and 2653 injuries each year. Additionally, I show that police militarization has increased the probability of an officer being killed by 5.3%. In line with the evidence that military equipment is often being used in disputes with armed and barricaded suspects (Kraska, 2007) and in drug raids (American Civil Liberties Union, 2014), I find that militarization only has a negative effect on the safety of police officers when they are answering a disturbance call, stopping a robbery or burglary, or engaging in a drug raid.====These results contribute to the literature on the effects of police militarization that go beyond police safety and killings by the police. Another focus of the literature has been the study of the crime-reducing effect of police militarization. For example, Bove and Gavrilova (2017) and Harris et al. (2017) show that militarization reduces many types of crime. Masera (2021) confirms these results and finds that while violent crime decreases in areas that become militarized, part of this reduction is due to the relocation of crime to neighboring areas. With this paper, I highlight that the gains from crime reduction can come at the cost of reduced police safety and an increase in killings by the police. Thus, policy makers’ decisions regarding the use of military equipment by the police should be informed by this tradeoff.","Police safety, killings by the police, and the militarization of US law enforcement",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000474,1 June 2021,2021,Research Article,46.0

Using Danish administrative employer-employee matched data, we document four novel results regarding the internal spatial organization of firms. First, the average number of establishments per firm increased by 21%. Second, the average distance of establishments and workers from their headquarters about doubled. Third, firms achieved this fragmentation by concentrating managers at headquarters locations and decentralizing jobs in production and business services occupations. Fourth, the ratio of managers to production and clerical workers within firms increased by 80%, driven particularly by headquarters and establishments located in the largest cities These facts imply that firms are not simply becoming more spatially dispersed; instead, they are fragmenting into functions.","In 1890, Alfred Marshall documented that cities and regions often specialize by sector. He argued that labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers lead to specialization and the rise of agglomeration economies (Marshall, 1890).==== More recently, Duranton and Puga (2005) document that the pattern of specialization is shifting from sectoral to functional by showing an increasing concentration of managerial occupations in large relative to small cities, relative to production occupations. They contend that changes in the organization of firms—led by decreases in the costs of remote management—could be behind this transformation. Furthermore, the changing spatial organization of activities within firms is sufficiently large to explain changes in occupational structure and wage dispersion across space (Spanos, Acosta, Lyngemark, 2020).====In this paper, we study how the location and labor composition of different establishments within firms have changed in the last four decades. Understanding these facts is relevant, given the importance of multi-establishment (ME) firms in the aggregate economy. Even though only 7% of all private firms in Denmark have more than one establishment, these firms account for around 47% of all private sector employment and 54% of total output revenue.==== Studying the changes in the spatial organization of these firms is necessary before addressing questions concerning the causes and consequences of these changes.====We study these spatial organizational patterns using Danish administrative employer- employee matched data between 1981 and 2016. Since the data have unique firm, establishment, and worker identifiers, we can determine whether a firm has one or multiple establishments and characterize each establishment based on its workers’ characteristics. Moreover, we observe the location of establishments at the traffic zone level, which are areas significantly smaller than municipalities. These detailed locations allow us to compute precise measures of firm decentralization without making strong assumptions regarding the location of establishments within a municipality or a county, as has been common in the literature.====We lay out four facts that describe the evolution of the spatial organization of firms since 1981. These facts are new in the literature and represent the main contribution of this paper. First, the average number of establishments within a firm increased by 21% between 1981 and 2016. This increase in firm fragmentation holds for all four aggregate sectors in our sample: manufacturing; finance, insurance, and real estate; business services; and transportation. Second, the spatial decentralization within firms has increased over time. Specifically, the average distance between firms’ establishments and their headquarters (HQ) about doubled during the last four decades. This increase primarily comes because firms’ new establishments have opened farther from HQ. Moreover, firms have reallocated jobs from HQ to more distant establishments.====Third, the increase in the distance to HQ has not been uniform across all occupations. In particular, increases in the average distance of workers in production, engineering, and business services occupations to their HQ account for 70% of the total increase in distance. On the other hand, increases in the average distance of managerial occupations to their HQ have been small (4%), while the use of managers has increased. These results point the existence of within establishment complementarities between some high-skilled occupations. Fourth, the ratio of managers to production and clerical workers increased by 12 percentage points (or 80%). This increase has been particularly large in HQ and establishments located in Copenhagen and Aarhus. Finally, our results suggest that the location and labor demand decisions of ME firms account for 51% of the increase in functional specialization observed in the data.====All of these facts show that while firms are becoming more spatially dispersed and their geographic span of control broader, the degree of decentralization is not the same across all of the firm’s activities. In particular, this decentralization is happening mostly for production and business services activities, while there is an increasing relative concentration of managerial activities around the firms’ central offices. Thus, these facts imply that firms are fragmenting into functions. Furthermore, given the deepening connection between geography and the internal organization of firms, our results suggest that the study of spatial and urban phenomena and the economics of organizations would be increasingly incomplete if they do not take each other into consideration. For instance, as ME firms are more likely to locate their HQ in larger cities, cities that retain them will be increasingly dominated by high-skilled, high-paid workers, which has clear implications for economic inequality and the operation of local labor markets.====This paper relates to the literature that studies the location decisions of ME firms and the agglomeration of HQ (Aarland, Davis, Henderson, Ono, 2007, Davis, Henderson, 2008, Henderson, Ono, 2008, Strauss-Kahn, Vives, 2009, Mota, Brandão, 2013, Alcácer, Delgado, 2016, Bartelme, Ziv, Oberfield, Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, Trachter, 2020). In particular, Henderson and Ono (2008) suggest that, a new location has to offer something beneficial for the firm, such as a larger variety of business services, to outweigh the higher communication and coordination costs. Most of these papers study firms’ location choices—and some of their determinants—by comparing firms in the cross-section. Our paper contributes to this literature by being the first one to study changes in firm fragmentation and spatial decentralization over a long period.====To our knowledge, our paper is the first to empirically study changes in the internal spatial organization of firms along the extensive margin (location of the firm’s establishments) and the intensive margin (distribution of workers across establishments). This allows us to understand the structure of firms and their possible effects on local economies in a more holistic way. In this regard, our paper also relates to research on the labor composition across different establishments within firms (Charnoz, Lelarge, Trevien, 2018, Cestone, Fumagalli, Kramarz, Pica, Antoni, Gumpert, Steimer, Acosta, Lyngemark, 2020).====This paper also contributes to the literature studying firm organization and its relation to communication costs (Becker, Murphy, 1992, Garicano, 2000). Our paper adds to this literature by highlighting the potential importance of geography in determining firm organization and corporate decisions, in line with Antrás et al. (2006), Landier et al. (2009), Kalnins and Lafontaine (2013), Antoni et al. (2019) and Spanos (2019). Moreover, we contribute to the literature in management sciences studying multi-unit corporations and the role of corporate HQ, such as Chandler (1969), Fligstein (1985), Collis et al. (2007) and Menz et al. (2015). This research tends to use qualitative methods or data for a few large firms, while our data cover the universe of firms within a country.====The location of establishments and firms has been studied in other fields within economics. First, in the international trade literature through the study of multinational enterprises (Antràs and Yeaple, 2014). We consider a firm’s decision to become a multinational to be a specific case of the firm fragmentation process. Second, in industrial organization through the study of market entry (Holmes, 2011, Aguirregabiria, Suzuki, 2016). Among others, Atalay et al. (2014) study vertical integration and outsourcing. Even though we consider these to be important margins of firm fragmentation, we take the boundaries of the firm as given due to data limitations.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

This paper estimates the effect of violent crime in municipalities of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala on the irregular emigration of children to the United States. It studies the full universe of 178,825 unaccompanied child migrants from those countries apprehended in the U.S. from 2011 to 2016. In the average municipality, generalized insecurity that produces 10 additional homicides in the origin city caused between three and six cumulative additional child-migrant apprehensions in the U.S.—a measure of irregular migration. Diffusion of migration experience through peer and family networks produces self-reinforcing, city-specific waves of migration that can rise even after violence subsides.","Does violence lead to flight from cities in the developing world? Violent crime severely affects urban economies, such as by reducing human capital investment and labor force participation (Sharkey, Torrats-Espinosa, 2017, Lacoe, Bostic, Acolin, 2018, Velásquez, 2020). Another mechanism—the effect of violent crime on emigration decisions—is relatively less studied. The literature on links between crime and migration usually considers the reverse direction of causation, the effect of immigration on violence (Ousey and Kubrin, 2018). Studying the effect of violence on emigration from migrant-origin cities is difficult because such effects are difficult to separate from the economic drivers of migration. Moreover, the relative effect of violence can be obscured by social multipliers that produce waves of migration, continuing to rise even if violence subsides.====This paper estimates the impact of violent crime surges in Central American cities on the emigration of children to the United States, in contrast with economic drivers of migration. It studies the full universe of 178,825 children who were born in the ‘Northern Triangle’ countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who emigrated to the United States without authorization and without an adult, and who were apprehended by the U.S. government between 2011 and 2016. The government’s term for a person thus apprehended during this period was Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC). This analysis measures the relationship between origin-city homicide rates and irregular migration the United States by children—as estimated by UAC apprehension rates—in a six-year panel of 893 municipalities. It tests the relative influence of new violence and social multipliers from past migration by building and estimating a continuous-time discrete choice search model of migration diffusion through social networks.====The results imply that in a Northern Triangle city, generalized insecurity producing a sustained increase of one homicide per year in all six years caused between 0.5 and 0.9 additional annual UAC apprehensions in the United States ==== between 2011 and 2016. This corresponds to between three and six cumulative additional UAC apprehensions per ten additional homicides across the entire period. Since homicides correlate closely with other manifestations of violence and insecurity, such as kidnapping and extortion, these estimates must be interpreted as the effect of broader insecurity that correlates with a given number of homicides—rather than the effect of homicides ====.====The lower and most conservative estimate controls for both municipality fixed effects and country-by-year fixed effects, thus identifying the effect only from municipality-specific increases in violence—discarding any effects of persistently high violence within municipalities or any time-trends affecting the entire country. The estimated effect of violence is robust to controlling for department (state)-level changes in labor-market drivers of migration. Estimation of the diffusion model shows that inertia from past UAC movement explains about one third of the relationship between more recent violence and current UAC flows. The findings are broadly robust to controlling for flexible unobserved time trends with arbitrarily spatially-correlated effects, to higher levels of saturation including department-by-year fixed effects, and to alternative functional forms.====The contribution of this study is to estimate the effect of violence on an important channel of emigration from Central American cities separate from the effects of economic conditions, network dynamics, and a range of potential unobserved confounders. The most closely related study, by Orozco-Aleman and Gonzalez-Lozano (2018), finds a positive effect of homicides in Mexican municipalities on Mexico-U.S. migration 2007–2012.==== Shrestha (2017) studies the reponse of international migration to political violence in a panel of towns in Nepal, and Boustan (2007) and Spitzer (2016) find a link between historical Eastern European pogroms and Jewish emigration to the New World. Prior research has shown an association between violence and emigration in national-level data (Shellman, Stewart, 2007, Amuedo-Dorantes, Puttitanun, 2016, Tobia, 2017) and a high prevalence of individual-level exposure to violence among prospective or actual emigrants (Jones, 1989, Wood, Gibson, Ribeiro, Hamsho-Diaz, 2010, Flores-Yeffal, Pren, 2018, Roth, Hartnett, 2018). Engel and Ibáñez (2007) and Ibáñez and Vélez (2008) find a causal link between rural violence and rural-urban migration. The present work is one of a very small number of quantitative studies on the drivers of child migration specifically (e.g. Donato, Sisk, 2015, Amuedo-Dorantes, Puttitanun, 2016).====The paper begins by proposing in Section 2 a simple theoretical framework to structure confounding of the violence-emigration relationship by economic or network drivers of migration. Sections 3 and 4 describe the empirical setting and data. Section 5 presents the core empirical results and several robustness tests, and Section 6 tests for confounding by economic drivers.

Matching data on state ministers’ place of residence and state government employment data for the universe of western German municipalities for 1994–2013, we show within a difference-in-differences framework that municipalities that are the residence of a minister experience a higher annual growth rate in state government employment if they retain this status for more than one legislative term. Thus, our results suggest that appointed cabinet members engage in hometown favoritism. We discuss several potential mechanisms for this behavior.","One of the main tasks of government is the allocation of public resources across space (Musgrave, 1997, Oates, 2005). What determines this allocation? On the one hand, governments may aim to maximize aggregate welfare. For example, an influential strand of literature in urban economics suggests that place-based policies can correct for spatial misallocations and market failures (Glaeser, Gottlieb, 2008, Kline, Moretti, 2014, Duranton, Venables, 2018). On the other hand, policymakers may also allocate public resources according to criteria unrelated to such economic considerations. In particular, they might favor certain localities over others for their own parochial reasons.====In this paper, we study whether this is the case for appointed cabinet members using the federal states of Germany as institutional laboratory. Each German state has a government with appointed members, called state ministers, as heads of executive departments. State ministers should act impartially and in the common interest of all citizens. Yet, their powerful positions award them ample influence to allocate public resources according to their parochial preferences.====We investigate whether German state ministers favor their hometowns, i.e., the municipality in which they reside, in the allocation of state government employment. For this purpose, we combine data on the growth rate of state government employment in a municipality – e.g., police officers, teachers, administrative personnel – over the period 1994 through 2013 with hand-collected data on the hometown of state ministers for all (non-city) states in western Germany. Relying on a difference-in-differences approach, we compare state government employment growth in treated and control municipalities, leveraging over-time and between-municipalities variation in treatment.====Our results indicate that ministers’ hometowns – henceforth, ==== – experience an average 1.7 percentage points higher annual growth rate in state government employment if they retain this status for longer than one legislative period.==== A 1.7 percentage points higher annual growth rate translates to 190 additional state government employees per minister during a five years legislature for the population-weighted average municipality in our sample. As each cabinet comprises ten to twenty ministers, the aggregate effect is even larger, conferring practical relevance to our finding.====With regards to mechanisms, we can reasonably rule out that state ministers favor their hometowns to increase the likelihood of reappointment after the following election. Given the proportional electoral systems in the German states, where the overall vote share across the entire state determines the election outcome, targeting small constituencies is not a viable electoral strategy for ministers or their parties. Other similarly narrow personal political incentives, such as winning a local office in their hometown or higher offices at the federal or European level, are also unlikely given typical career progression in German politics. Several of our findings also render improbable the possibility that state ministers favor their hometowns due to more diffuse political motivations, such as helping the local party branch win local elections. We also fail to find evidence that ministers favor their hometowns because they want to kickstart a career outside politics.====Rather than such narrow personal incentives, our findings suggest broader parochial motivations as a more plausible mechanism for ministers’ hometown favoritism. State ministers might have an inherent preference to benefit (certain members of) their communities, with no (or only diffuse) personal rewards. This preference could encompass a desire to improve public goods provision in their hometowns, to help “friends and family”, to reward their party’s local members, but also the inability to resist co-residents’ demands for jobs.====Overall, we show that appointed cabinet members engage in targeted redistribution in the form of hometown favoritism. This finding is relevant for the urban economics literature on the effectiveness of place-based policies. Theoretical contributions to this literature suggest that place-based policies can be welfare-enhancing if implemented to capitalize on agglomeration economies or to address market imperfections (Duranton, Venables, 2018, Kline, Moretti, 2014). However, existing empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these policies is mixed (Glaeser, Gottlieb, 2008, Neumark, Simpson, 2015). Our results indicate that one reason for this empirical ambiguity may lie in policymakers’ motivations when deciding on such policies. If allocative efficiency is only of secondary importance for the spatial distribution of public resources, estimates of place-based policies’ effectiveness might be biased downwards.====Our paper is also related to the political-economy literature on spatial distortions in public spending. In line with the neoclassical model of politics, this literature highlights that some political constituencies are electorally more important than others (Weingast, Shepsle, Johnsen, 1981, Cox, McCubbins, 1986, Cox, 2009). Empirical evidence confirming the importance of distributive politics exists for directly elected members of the legislative and executive branches (see, e.g., Berry et al. (2010), Brollo and Nannicini (2012) and Albouy (2013)). However, to our knowledge, no evidence exists for appointed public officials, notably for cabinet members, even though they head departments responsible for implementing a broad range of public projects and thus, ultimately, for the spatial distribution of public resources (Berry et al., 2010).====Our paper also contributes to the literature on political selection (Besley, 2005), particularly to the branch discussing the optimal allocation of policy tasks between elected and appointed officials. Existing evidence shows that elected officials have stronger incentives than those appointed to engage in distributive politics (see, e.g., Besley and Coate (2003), Enikolopov (2014), or Whaley (2013)).==== Under this premise, the literature proceeds to give guidance on the allocation of policy tasks to these two types of officials (Alesina, Tabellini, 2007, Alesina, Tabellini, 2008, Besley, Coate, 2003, Maskin, Tirole, 2004). Our results suggest that this literature should consider that appointed officials, too, may have biases and may engage in targeted redistribution.====Finally, our paper is also related to the literature on regional, ethnic, and similar identity-based explanations of favoritism (Pande, 2003, Franck, Rainer, 2012, Burgess, Jedwab, Miguel, Morjaria, Padró i Miquel, 2015, De Luca, Hodler, Raschky, Valsecchi, 2018, Besley, Pande, Rao, 2011, Hodler, Raschky, 2014, Do, Nguyen, Tran, 2017). This literature typically focuses on non-democratic settings. To our knowledge, only two studies find policymakers without narrowly defined personal electoral incentives engaging in hometown favoritism in democratic settings. First, Carozzi and Repetto (2016) find a birth town bias in the allocation of central government transfers by Italian members of parliament not born within their current electoral district. Second, Fiva and Halse (2016) show a hometown bias in public road construction by regional governments in Norway. These papers, however, study directly elected politicians while we focus on appointed officeholders. Institutional constraints, as well as political and personal incentives, plausibly differ for appointed officials, and in particular for cabinet members.",Appointed public officials and local favoritism: Evidence from the German states,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009411902100036X,6 May 2021,2021,Research Article,49.0

I analyse the labour market effects of light rail in four US metros. I propose a new ==== to overcome endogeneity in transit station location, enabling causal identification of neighbourhood effects. Light rail stations are found to drastically improve employment outcomes in the surrounding neighbourhood. To incorporate endogenous sorting by workers, I estimate a structural neighbourhood choice model. Light rail systems tend to raise rents in accessible locations, displacing lower skilled workers to isolated neighbourhoods, which reduces aggregate metropolitan employment in equilibrium.","US cities have made significant investments in Light Rail Transit (LRT) in recent years. A common justification for LRT is that transit infrastructure will improve urban commuting networks by providing spatial connections between workers and jobs. I test the contention that LRT improves labour market outcomes. First, I estimate the neighbourhood level effects of LRT stations. I introduce a new instrumental variable that establishes orthogonality between station location and pretreatment local economic conditions. I find that gaining a LRT station increases the local employment rate. Second, I estimate a structural neighbourhood choice model to uncover the mechanisms that generate neighbourhood employment changes and estimate aggregate effects. The analysis spans four US cities over the 2000–2015 period.====LRT has become a popular form of transit due to low construction costs relative to subway systems and large perceived economic benefits. LRT systems are typically built along existing roads, removing the need for expensive tunnelling or elevated infrastructure. While LRT shares road space with vehicles and pedestrians, portions of routes are given traffic priority, enabling faster speeds and fewer delays than experienced by buses. In contrast to bus transit, the need for rails, an overhead power source and station platforms ensures that LRT represents a long term local investment.====Transit is not allocated randomly within a city, but is directed toward neighbourhoods with specific characteristics. Comparing the economic outcomes of areas with transit to those without will not provide causal estimates of project impacts due to the effect of differing pretreatment conditions and economic trends. An inclination among transportation planners to extend light rail to the airport provides a natural experiment that introduces an element of randomness to station location. Neighbourhoods between downtown and the airport were much more likely to receive a LRT station than similar neighbourhoods located elsewhere in the metro. I exploit a preference for airport connections to estimate local effects. The endogeneity of transit location is a well known issue from prior literature (Baum-Snow, Kahn, 2000, Holzer, Quigley, Raphael, 2003, Ihlanfeldt, Sjoquist, 1998). For example, affluent neighbourhoods have been found to resist rail infrastructure due to concerns that transit may lead to a rise in local crime (Kahn, 2007). After correcting for endogenous transit allocation, I find LRT stations generate large improvements in ==== employment outcomes.====Using neighbourhood change estimates as model inputs, I propose and estimate a structural neighbourhood choice model and conclude that LRT systems fail to raise ==== employment. In addition to facilitating commutes, LRT stations are valuable local consumption amenities that increase demand for local housing, raising rents. LRT is typically built in accessible, central locations. As a result, low skilled workers are displaced from central locations by rising prices. As employment status is more elastic among the low skilled, the mechanism leads to an aggregate decrease in metropolitan employment. LRT may, counterintuitively, exacerbate the spatial isolation of low skilled workers through a process of household displacement. The ability of local amenities to drive up land values and alter a neighbourhood’s composition is a familiar mechanism from literature on place based urban policies (Hanson, 2009, Kline, 2010, Kline, Moretti, 2014). This mechanism has been known to undermine spatially targeted policies. I show that the same mechanism is relevant to LRT projects. Structural estimation results show that LRT stations represent a valuable local amenity. I also find LRT is effective at raising aggregate transit use, as it appeals to higher skilled workers who would be unlikely to take other forms of public transit while low skilled workers remain captive transit users.====Poor spatial access to job opportunities can hinder employment outcomes due to high commuting costs (Kain, 1968). Numerous studies have expanded upon the ==== hypothesis to explain heterogeneity in urban labour market outcomes and particularly to explain the lagging outcomes of racial minorities and youth (Andersson, Haltiwanger, Kutzbach, Pollakowski, Weinberg, 2018, Gobillon, Selod, Zenou, 2007, Holzer, Quigley, Raphael, 2003, Sanchez, Shen, Peng, 2004, Stoll, 1999, Tyndall, 2017). Past research has found that unemployed and poor workers tend to live in places that are isolated from relevant job opportunities. However, the literature has not shown conclusively whether the relationship between accessibility and employment is the result of unemployed workers self-selecting into isolated neighbourhoods, or if there is a causal effect of neighbourhood connectivity on individual employment outcomes. If the effect is causal, transit infrastructure expansion may raise equilibrium employment by reducing spatial isolation.====There is strong evidence that proximity to transit is an important consideration in household location choice (Glaeser et al., 2008). LeRoy and Sonstelie (1983) provided a dynamic model of transportation induced urban change. Wasmer, Zenou, 2002, Wasmer, Zenou, 2006 propose a general urban commuting model that leads to unemployed workers voluntarily occupying inaccessible areas due to infrequent travel. I extend the intuition of these models by incorporating a polycentric city, which generates more complex patterns of neighbourhood sorting.====Some prominent papers have directly analysed local effects of rail stations (Baum-Snow, Kahn, 2000, Kahn, 2007). Results pointed towards localized increases in home values and increased transit use. Few studies have attempted to estimate the neighbourhood effects of LRT stations specifically. Cao and Schoner (2014) studied ridership effects of LRT in Minneapolis. Residents moving towards new transit were found to be less likely to use LRT than the original residents, suggesting a gentrification effect. Heilmann (2018) found evidence of rising incomes in Dallas neighbourhoods that gained a rail station. Contrastingly, Delmelle and Nilsson (2018) analyzed rail projects across the US and found little evidence that stations cause displacement among low income residents. Recent work by Severen (2018) investigates the effect of LRT construction in Los Angeles, finding that LRT has a positive effect on labour supply. The literature provides limited guidance on the overall effects of LRT systems on labour markets, which is striking given the rapid propagation of such systems in the US.====I contribute to the literature in a number of ways. First, I provide policy relevant estimates of the labour market effects of LRT. Second, I supply a new instrumental variable for endogenous station location. Third, I add to the discrete neighbourhood choice literature by developing a structural sorting model that includes preference parameters for transit.====The paper will proceed as follows. Section 2 summarizes the LRT projects under analysis. Section 3 introduces data sources. Section 4 estimates the neighbourhood effects of new LRT stations.

Key stylized facts are documented and compared to findings from a previous survey (Gyourko, Saiz, Summers, 2008). We are able to observe how the local regulatory environment has changed in over 800 communities in both samples. This represents the first consistent nationwide data documenting changes in residential ==== at the local jurisdictional level. Finally, we discuss how these changes can and should broaden the research questions for housing and urban economists investigating the local residential land use environment.","High house prices, especially in America's larger coastal markets, have spawned growing concerns about housing affordability for middle class, not just low income, households. The potential role of local residential land use restrictions in helping to generate such high prices is an issue of growing importance in the public and academic spheres. In the public arena, this led to a host of policy responses on both sides of the aisle, including a 2019 Presidential Executive Order establishing a White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing and the Biden Administration's plans to eliminate local regulations.==== Regionally, this has been a topic of public debate in California especially, with recently proposed legislation that would have restricted localities from stopping residential construction in certain circumstances. In addition, the rise of a Yes In My Back Yard (YIMBY) political movement is a relatively new development in various parts of the country ranging from California and Oregon to Minnesota.==== The academic literature on the topic also has grown substantially in recent years.====There are many challenges to producing convincing analysis of the impact of the local regulatory environment, but such research always starts with measuring restrictiveness.==== In this paper, we report results from a new survey of the residential land use regulatory environment in nearly 2,500 primarily suburban jurisdictions across a wide array of metropolitan areas throughout the country.==== We construct a measure of regulatory restrictiveness called the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index (WRLURI), utilizing the same methodology as for the first Wharton regulatory index to facilitate comparison over time. To distinguish the new index from the first Wharton survey conducted over a decade ago, we refer to the new measure as WRLURI2018 and the previous index as WRLURI2006.====Our index methodology provides a convenient way to rank individual communities and markets in terms of their regulatory restrictiveness. The index is standardized so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, where a higher value implies more regulation. However, the index does not reveal the actual regulatory policies and practices of different places. To provide a translation from index values to characteristics of regulatory environments on the ground, we group communities by their rank in the overall distribution of WRLURI2018 values. More specifically, we consider those in the bottom quartile of the WRLURI2018 distribution to be lightly regulated, those in the top quartile to be highly-regulated, and those in the interquartile range to have an average level of regulation.====Being relatively lightly regulated by our metric does not imply that the jurisdiction is unregulated or characterized by a near absence of residential land use controls. Among this subset of communities, two entities (usually a local planning commission and a local council) typically are required to approve any project that needs rezoning. Even for projects not requiring a variance to the zoning code, it is not uncommon for lightly-regulated communities to require the approval of two local entities in order for the development to proceed. Density restrictions are omnipresent, too. Ninety-four percent of the communities in the ==== quartile of the WRLURI2018 distribution have some type of minimum lot size requirement in at least one of their neighborhoods, with the typical minimum being less than one-half acre. It also takes a meaningful amount of time to get a proposal through the approval process in these relatively lightly-regulated communities. The average time span between submitting a project for approval and receiving a decision is 3.7 months, which amounts to 111 days assuming thirty days per month.====As was the case with the 2006 survey, the new data show that highly-regulated places tend to be more so on multiple dimensions. Thus, they are in the top quartile of the rankings not because they are extremely restrictive in only a few facets of regulation. These places tend to have at least three different entities that must approve (and, thus, can veto) a project. Density restrictions are more severe on average, as the modal community among this group reports a 2+ acre minimum lot size restriction in at least one of its neighborhoods. In addition, there is a more intense level of involvement in the regulatory process reported on the part of public and local officials in the places we rate as the most highly regulated. These jurisdictions are also more likely to have open space requirements and exaction fee programs imposed on builders. Project review delay times are more than double those found in the lightly-regulated areas, with the average being 8.4 months.====The average regulatory environment looks like the mean of the lightly- and highly-regulated ones. Hence, there is no place (on average) where residential development is simple and quick in the sense that projects are reviewed quickly by a single entity that has final approval rights.====A stricter regulatory regime at the jurisdiction level is associated with higher house values, higher incomes and a larger share of college graduates. In contrast, other local traits such as race and housing unit permitting intensity are not strongly correlated with our regulatory measure. These patterns appear to be robust over time, too, as lagged house values, incomes and level of educational achievement also predict current WRLURI2018 values, but neither lagged racial composition nor permitting intensity do so.==== Thus, more restrictive residential land use regulation appears bundled together with high human capital, high incomes and expensive homes, both in the cross section and over time.====To the extent that metropolitan area-wide housing markets themselves differ along these lines, there should be spatial variation visible at that more aggregate level.  This is documented using data from 44 metropolitan areas (technically, core-based statistical areas or CBSAs) in which there were at least ten communities responding to our survey. With 10 or more respondents, we felt comfortable creating market-wide regulatory index values, which reflect the simple means of the individual communities’ WRLURI2018 values. The San Francisco and New York City CBSAs are the most highly regulated markets in the country, with each having a WRLURI2018 value that is more than one standard deviation above the national average.====In addition, there is a clear regional pattern to the CBSA-level results (see Fig. 1 and Table 4 below).  Nine of the top 10 markets in terms of measured regulatory strictness are situated along either the northeast coast (from Boston down through Washington, D.C.) or the west coast of the country (Seattle, Portland (OR), San Francisco and Los Angeles).  The most lightly-regulated among the group of larger metropolitan areas tend to be declining markets in the Rust Belt region (e.g., Cleveland, OH, Grand Rapids, MI, Cincinnati, OH, Detroit, MI, and St. Louis, MO).  These markets tend to have WRLURI2018 values that are about one-quarter to one-third of a standard deviation below the national mean.====  The interquartile range of this group contains a wide array of markets across the rest of the country.  Markets around the national average (WRLURI2018 index values within one-tenth of a standard deviation from zero) include Houston, TX, Columbus, OH, San Antonio, TX, and Pittsburgh, PA.  A simple fixed effects regression of jurisdiction-level WRLURI2018 values on CBSA dummies generates a R=====0.45.  A separate bivariate regression on census division dummies has much less explanatory power (R=====0.09), so housing market-level effects are stronger.  Even so, the bulk of the variation in regulatory index value is across places within a metropolitan area.  On average, the locality itself clearly matters in determining its regulatory environment.====The 2018 survey allows us to paint a broad picture of the current regulatory environment.  However, the cross section cannot tell us how the regulatory environment changed over time—either in aggregate or for certain markets or regions.  To document changes, we exploit data from the 2006 Wharton survey (Gyourko et al. (2008)) and measure changes in communities’ responses across the two sets of responses.  In an online appendix, we detail changes from both the repeated cross-sections (all 2,720 respondent communities in 2006 versus all 2,825 in 2018) and the panel of 890 communities that responded to both survey waves.==== We believe this is the first consistent nationwide data to document changes in residential land use regulation at the local jurisdiction level.====In the text below, we focus on a small number of changes that we believe are especially relevant for future research.  The first is not a change at all, but the absence of change.  More specifically, restrictive local land use environments seem highly resistant to weakening.  At the metropolitan area level, there is no case of a highly regulated market as of 2006 becoming substantially (or even modestly) less regulated over time. To the extent there is change, it is to strengthen the control regime.  Now that we can measure change (or its absence) over time, a key question for future research is to pin down why.====This is not to imply that the nature of the local regulatory environment has been static since the mid-2000s.  One trend involves the spread of density controls.  Minimum lot size restrictions are not new, but they have become very popular and are now almost omnipresent across nearly every locality in every type of metropolitan area.  Moreover, it is no longer uncommon to see a 1-acre+ minimum in the suburbs of virtually any housing market.  This is not the case for other controls such as exaction fees (which declined in usage between the two surveys), open space requirements, or housing affordability requirements.  Future research needs to use this variation to model and better understand why the local regulatory environment looks the way it does.  A start on this issue would involve determining why the benefit-cost ratio of imposing higher minimum lot sizes seemed so much more favorable to many localities compared to the other regulations they could have imposed.====A third interesting stylized fact involves changes over time in the share of highly-regulated communities with a metropolitan area.  Among CBSAs that we categorize as highly-regulated metropolitan housing markets, the share of highly-regulated jurisdictions within them rose over time.  In contrast, among CBSAs that we categorize as lightly-regulated, it is nearly equally likely that the share of high-regulated communities within them fell (not rose) over time.  As is documented below, this change is making it harder than it was only a decade ago for a prospective home buyer in the San Francisco Bay Area to find a lightly-regulated community.  However, it remains easy, and became easier, to find such a community in more lightly-regulated regions such as Pittsburgh, Chicago and Atlanta.  The change in the Bay Area (and other markets like it) has potentially vital implications for affordability conditions and the nature of the housing market itself when a middle class household cannot easily substitute away from a restrictive supply side environment almost anywhere within the local labor market area.====A fourth and final change that we think will help drive future research is the ongoing rise in the arduousness of navigating the regulatory environment from the homebuilder's perspective.  This is best evinced by the increase over time in the number of regulatory bodies that must approve, and thus have veto rights, over any development project requiring a variance to the local zoning code.  This change is widespread and is not confined to the most highly regulated markets in the 2018 survey.  Why this is so and what it accomplishes for individual communities should be on the research agenda of those interested in understanding local government behavior.====Note that none of these changes directly involves how regulation affects housing prices, which has been the most studied issue in this area. That topic certainly will not go away and the ability to use differences in the regulatory environment over time will help make that research more credible. However, there clearly are new and different aspects of the political economy of local government and their housing markets that can be addressed with the new survey data complementing the old.====The plan of the paper is as follows. The next section describes how we construct the aggregate regulatory index for each place. Section III then reports results. This section describes the distribution across individual communities throughout the nation and then reports on market-wide variation. We also translate what the index numbers mean in terms of actual regulations in place. Section IV describes how the regulatory environment has changed over time.

On the one hand, by limiting the ability of the central government to redistribute resources towards regions in financial needs, decentralization hardens ==== and enhances fiscal discipline (see, e.g., Qian and Roland, 1998). On the other hand, by triggering tax competition over mobile tax bases, decentralized systems may widen interregional disparities. This distributional issue has been highlighted by Rémy Prud’homme in an influential essay: under decentralization, richer regions may exploit large tax bases to attract mobile factors and, ultimately, provide more local public goods than poorer regions. In that sense, ==== (Prudhomme, 1995, p. 203).====We develop a model that formalizes this trade-off balancing equity and efficiency and, through those lenses, we shed light on the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization. Our model economy is composed of two regions. Each region has an immobile risk-neutral resident, who owns a fixed endowment of capital. Regions are heterogeneous across capital endowments, and we refer to the “rich” (“poor”) region as the one with the largest (smallest) amount of capital. Capital serves as the only input to produce a private good through a linear technology. Residents are free to choose in which region to invest their capital, but investing outside the domestic region incurs convex mobility costs. Apart from the private good, residents also derive utility from a discrete local public good (or project). Providing a local project requires an initiation cost in terms of the private good, and may require an additional round of refinancing to be completed. Only completed projects yield social benefit to the local resident.====The model economy features a central government, and regional governments. The latter have the authority and resources to initiate local projects, but need additional revenue if projects are to be refinanced. Due to this feature, local governments have different incentives to spend, depending on whether refinancing decisions occur at the central or at the regional level.====We concentrate on whether taxation authority should be decentralized or not, and study two polar institutional regimes: ==== and ====. Under the former, each regional government decides upon continuing projects in financial needs by raising local capital taxes, in a context of tax competition. Under tax centralization, instead, the central government decides if incomplete projects should be bailed out by means of a uniform national capital tax. Importantly, public expenditure is already decentralized in both regimes.==== This is consistent with the fact that, in most countries, local governments have much more autonomy over spending than over local taxation (see, e.g., OECD/KIPF, 2016).====Our model formalizes the aforementioned trade-off between interregional inequality and efficiency of subnational spending. Namely, tax centralization dampens regional disparities, but can lead to overprovision of local projects. Tax decentralization, in contrast, amplifies the gap between the rich and the poor region, but eliminates excessive local spending. Additionally, our model singles out other types of inefficiencies emerging from the decentralized regime. That is, local projects can in fact be underprovided with respect to the first best, and initiated projects are subject to refinancing distortions and deadweight losses associated with tax competition. The optimal institutional regime is the one that maximizes a flexible social welfare metric, which allows for aversion to interregional inequalities.====The choice of the optimal regime is shaped by the interplay of three fundamentals: the difference in initial capital endowments across regions, the social aversion to interregional inequalities, and the probability that regions experience a refinancing shock. The first two parameters drive, respectively, the degree of ex ante interregional disparities, and the social welfare weight on regional convergence. The third parameter determines the expected completion time of a project and, thus, the likelihood with which centralization and decentralization generate different outcomes ex post.====We start by characterizing the optimal regime under a utilitarian criterion, and over the entire range of refinancing shock probabilities. Two major results are drawn. First, small initial disparities can ==== tax decentralization. Essentially, a higher capital endowment in the hands of the rich region allows it to lower tax distortions in its jurisdiction, thanks to a larger tax base. We show that, for low levels of regional heterogeneity, this effect is first-order relative to other distortions, and makes expected welfare under tax decentralization increasing in the degree of regional disparities. Second, large disparities do not necessarily make decentralization suboptimal. We pin down a necessary and sufficient condition for that to be the case, which is tied to the relative net expected return on initiated projects under each regime in the poor region.====Next, we evaluate the optimal regime choice under different social preferences. Since tax centralization reduces ex ante inequalities, higher social aversion for interregional disparities typically favors tax centralization over decentralization (all else equal). But somewhat paradoxically, even a Rawlsian planner would adopt the decentralized regime under some conditions. More precisely, as long as regions are relatively homogeneous and the refinancing probability is high enough, tax decentralization dominates for ==== welfare criterion, including one which only weights the welfare of the poorest region in the economy.====The reason for this result is twofold. First, a high probability of refinancing brings down the net expected return of a local project. Hence, overinvestment inefficiencies under centralization are severe relative to underinvestment issues under decentralization. Second, when regions are sufficiently homogeneous, the poor region would need to fund a large fraction of central bailouts, while facing small tax competition distortions (as regions levy similar tax rates). Therefore, small disparities also favor the decentralized regime from the perspective of the poor.====In short, our findings indicate that that initial inequality across regions should not be regarded as an obstacle for tax decentralization reforms. Particularly: (i) small disparities can actually favor decentralization, (ii) decentralized taxation might be preferred under extreme regional inequality, and (iii) as long as existing regional disparities are not too large, fiscal decentralization can still be optimal under Rawlsian social preferences. In turn, the inherent inefficiencies of centralization may dwarf one of the key “dangers” of decentralization articulated by Prudhomme (1995).====We close the paper with an empirical analysis, where we examine whether real-world policies align—to a certain extent—with the prescriptions of the normative model. As a first step, we revisit the empirical relationship between tax decentralization and regional disparities across countries. Differently from previous works, we test for a non-monotonic relationship, and employ a recent and comprehensive dataset on regional inequality (built by Lessmann and Seidel, 2017) which relies on nighttime luminosity data. We find that conditional on regional disparities being small (large), tax decentralization is positively (negatively) correlated with regional inequality. This empirical pattern can be compatible with the recommendations of our model, provided that social aversion for interregional inequality is sufficiently low. Accordingly, our estimations partially support the hypothesis that regional inequality should not be regarded as an obstacle for tax decentralization reforms.==== Our paper contributes to the vast theoretical literature on optimal fiscal federalism initiated by Musgrave (1959) and Oates (1972) (see Oates, 1999 for a survey). An important strand of the literature on optimal fiscal federalism has studied the trade-off between centralization and decentralization within political economy frameworks (Lockwood, 2006 provides a survey). Notably, Besley and Coate (2003) (BC) study an environment with heterogeneous citizens, and highlight the role of interregional spillovers in shaping decentralization outcomes.====Relative to BC, we concentrate on a different trade-off between centralization and decentralization. In BC’s model, decentralized decision making substitutes political economy distortions for inefficiencies due to public goods spillovers. In our model, decentralization substitutes fiscal externalities due to uniform taxation for inefficient tax competition and larger disparities across regions. Relatedly, BC and our paper highlight inefficiencies arising from two different types of delegation: ==== decentralization in BC, and ==== decentralization in our paper. This distinct focus leads to key differences between our modeling choices and BC’s. Most significantly, the institutional regimes we compare are not the same as those in BC, the types of interregional heterogeneity and externalities are fundamentally different across papers, and the normative criterion in our work is more general than the one in BC.====Technically, our model builds on Bellofatto and Besfamille (2018), where we study the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization in the presence of regional state capacity imperfections. Two key differences from that paper are that we introduce interregional heterogeneity, and that we consider a richer normative criteria that explicitly accounts for equity considerations. More generally, the present paper also relates to the literature on the optimality of soft- vs. hard-budget constraints in federations, including Qian and Roland (1998), Köthenbürger (2004), and Besfamille and Lockwood (2008), among others. All of those works focus on environments with identical regions.====In addition, our paper connects with the literature on asymmetric capital tax competition, following the line of the seminal contributions of Bucovetsky (1991) and Wilson (1991) (a thorough survey of the tax competition literature can be found in Wilson, 1999). A central result in those papers is the so-called “advantage of smallness.” Namely, “small” regions levy lower taxes than “large” regions in equilibrium, which ultimately leads to higher welfare for the residents of the small region. One notable difference with Bucovetsky (1991) and Wilson (1991) is that regional asymmetries in those works come from differences in population sizes, and not from differences in capital endowments per capita as in this paper (for this reason, we prefer employing the “rich-poor” rather than the “large-small” taxonomy).==== In that sense, our paper relates to DePater and Myers (1994) and Peralta and van Ypersele (2005), who analyze capital tax competition environments in which regions not only differ across population sizes, but also across capital endowments per resident. A central feature of these models is the presence of a “pecuniary externality” (or “terms of trade effect”), through which regions can manipulate the price of capital. In our environment, though, such pecuniary externality is absent because the marginal productivity of capital is constant.====Another key difference with the bulk of the literature on tax competition is that, in our framework, public expenditure does not adjust residually. Rather, the level of public spending is ==== at the tax competition stage. Hence, when regions engage in tax competition in our model, the poor region ends up setting a higher tax rate than the rich, simply because the tax base of the latter is larger. This rationalizes the mechanism hypothesized by Prudhomme (1995), which goes against the “advantage of smallness” result.====Our framework thus highlights the role of inefficient tax competition in aggravating regional disparities.==== Similarly, Cai and Treisman (2005) show that regional competition (over infrastructure spending and taxes) to attract mobile capital can exacerbate initial disparities across regions. Janeba and Todtenhaupt (2018) evaluate how such polarization effect is influenced by the levels of initial government debt. Unlike those papers, we compare the relative merits of centralized and decentralized regimes.====Finally, our paper relates to the empirical literature on the determinants of fiscal decentralization, dating back to at least Pryor (1968) (see Letelier, 2005 for a survey). Despite the vast number of works within this line of research, few papers have emphasized the potential impact of regional disparities on tax decentralization.==== Two notable exceptions are the works of Stegarescu (2009) and Sacchi and Salotti (2014), who find that regional income differences negatively affect tax decentralization in OECD countries. Relative to those authors, we consider a larger sample (comprising not only developed countries), and test for a non-monotonic relationship between tax decentralization and regional disparities.====Other relevant works estimate the influence of alternative dimensions of regional heterogeneity—beyond regional income differences—on fiscal decentralization. The results of those analyses are mixed. Panizza (1999), for example, finds a positive relationship between ethnolinguistic regional diversity and fiscal decentralization, but Arzaghi and Henderson (2005) conclude the opposite.==== The layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Sections 3 and 4 focus on the tax centralization and the tax decentralization regimes, respectively, by analyzing equilibrium outcomes and inefficiencies under each regime. Section 5 characterizes the optimal regime, Section 6 presents the empirical analysis, and Section 7 concludes. Most proofs are relegated to the Appendix. An Online Appendix contains numerical simulations of the model, as well as further details and robustness checks on the empirical analysis.",Tax decentralization notwithstanding regional disparities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000280,24 March 2021,2021,Research Article,53.0

Thus, recent models of QSE and one of the oldest location choice models can rationalize the same change in equilibrium following shocks to economic fundamentals. However, their welfare implications—even conditional on the same change in equilibrium—may differ, depending on the specification of preferences and on the type of shocks we consider.","Perhaps the defining characteristic of spatial economics is that agents choose their location endogenously. There are two different approaches to modeling endogenous location decisions. One is to assume free mobility of homogeneous workers as in the new economic geography models by Krugman (1991) and Helpman (1998). The other is to allow heterogeneous workers, who have idiosyncratic preferences over different locations, to choose the most preferred one, building on the conditional logit model by McFadden (1974).====These seminal approaches have paved the way for quantitative spatial economics (QSE). As stated by Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017), QSE requires a structural model that combines various components such as preferences, production technology, and frictions for the movement of goods, people, and ideas. Despite the long literature on endogenous location decisions, how the specifications of these components affect spatial equilibria and their welfare implications has not been systematically explored.====In this paper, we start with one component of first-order importance, namely, preferences, holding the specifications of other components fixed. As in workhorse models of QSE, we assume that regional wages and price indices are determined in ==== such that the labor market clears in each region and the good market clears for each product. Those market clearing conditions depend on a regional distribution of population, which is determined in ==== such that no one has an incentive to relocate. In what follows, we call a situation, in which a regional population distribution is in spatial equilibrium ==== in which regional wages and price indices are in general equilibrium, simply an ====.====We show that the McFadden (1974) model of idiosyncratic preferences, together with the condition that the individual choice probability of a region equals the population share of that region, can generate the spatial equilibrium condition in the Helpman (1998) model of common preferences.==== Thus, the two models, which differ by the specification of preferences, can yield the same spatial equilibrium. The intuition is that these models have isomorphic dispersion forces, i.e., for any given total population, a larger regional population exacerbates congestion in the Helpman (1998) model, whereas it requires more people who are less willing to choose that region in the McFadden (1974) model. The same spatial equilibrium, together with our assumption that the specifications of components other than preferences are held fixed, implies that the two models generate the same regional wages and price indices in general equilibrium. As a result, these two models yield the same equilibrium. Furthermore, a shock to fixed costs, trade costs, or total population leads to the same change in equilibrium in both models. We show that these results also hold for more recent models of QSE.====Hence, as long as we consider the change in the equilibrium allocation, we can focus on the preferences in the McFadden (1974) model, i.e., one of the oldest models used for location choice, thereby reducing the number of spatial economic models that have to be quantified.==== This result is useful since, as illustrated by Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017), there are too many combinations of different components to quantify each of all possible models of QSE. It also allows us to sharpen the quantitative analysis by indicating when different models of QSE yield the same quantitative change in the equilibrium allocation.====Interestingly, however, the welfare implications may differ across models, depending on the type of shocks we consider. To clarify which type of shocks generates different welfare conclusions, we distinguish two cases: the impacts of a change in total population on welfare; and the impacts of a spatial reallocation of population on welfare, holding total population constant.====First, we consider a change in total population due to immigration, emigration, births or deaths. In this case, we show that even when a change in total population induces the same change in the equilibrium allocation in both the McFadden (1974) model of idiosyncratic preferences and the Helpman (1998) model of common preferences, the associated welfare change in the former model includes an additional effect that is positive (negative) when the total population increases (decreases). Thus, the welfare consequences of a change in the total population are sensitive to underlying model specifications, even when those specifications rationalize the same observed change in the equilibrium allocation.====In a nutshell, we obtain different welfare changes in spite of the same change in equilibrium when that change in equilibrium is driven by a change in total population. The intuition for this result is that an increase in total population exacerbates congestion in the Helpman (1998) model of common preferences, whereas it amounts to having more people who get new i.i.d. preference draws in the McFadden (1974) model of idiosyncratic preferences (and thus it does not require more people who are less willing to choose that region unlike the case with a fixed total population).====Second, to see the impact of a spatial reallocation of population, holding total population constant, we consider a change in regional subsidies as in Kline and Moretti (2014). In this case, welfare changes in the workhorse models of QSE we analyze in this paper are isomorphic, conditional on the same change in the equilibrium allocation. We also show that this result can be generalized to other shocks or policy interventions that leave the total population unchanged.====Thus, except for the case with the change in total population, our result is similar to that in Arkolakis et al. (2012), namely that different trade models lead to the same formula for welfare gains, conditional on the same change in the domestic expenditure share.====Our work is closely related to the literature on product differentiation showing that discrete choice models with heterogeneous agents can generate the same aggregate demand as representative agent models (see Anderson, de Palma, Thisse, 1992, Thisse, Ushchev, 2016). Yet, our paper on location choice is different from the existing work on product choice in at least two respects. First, in their aggregate demand analysis, representative agents consume all available varieties, whereas heterogeneous agents choose only one variety. In our paper, both representative and heterogeneous consumers choose only one location. Second, in their aggregate demand analysis, representative agents consume the same set of varieties, whereas heterogeneous agents consume a different variety. In contrast, in our location choice analysis, even ex ante identical consumers can end up choosing different locations.====To see more clearly the difference between product choice in Anderson et al. (1992) and location choice in our paper, consider the following thought experiment. If the result from the aggregate demand analysis in Anderson et al. (1992) were directly applied to our spatial setting, each (ex ante identical) agent in the Helpman (1998) model would choose to locate in all locations by splitting his/her time endowment. This case is largely irrelevant because location choice is typically described as a discrete choice problem even for homogeneous agents. Accordingly, one cannot readily apply their result on product choice to a location choice setting.====Our paper is also related to the literature establishing the relationship between different location choice models. For instance, as shown in Schmidheiny and Brülhart (2011), conditional logit and Poisson models predict differently the gains and losses in regional population, even when these two models return identical coefficient estimates. In particular, the former implies a ‘zero-sum’ world (i.e., one region’s gain is the other region’s loss) and the latter a ‘positive-sum’ world (i.e., one region’s gain is no other region’s loss). Our result has a similar flavor: even when the McFadden (1974) model and the Helpman (1998) model predict the same gains and losses in regional population following some shock to total population in the economy, they will have different welfare consequences.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model of common preferences and that of idiosyncratic preferences. In Section 3, we compare these two models. We derive our main results on the equilibrium allocation and on welfare in Section 3.1 and in Section 3.2, respectively. Section 4 illustrates our main results by distinguishing the welfare impacts of a change in total population from those of a change in regional subsidies. Section 5 turns to the related literature, where we consider other models of QSE with the Armington assumption or Fréchet draws and discuss the case with continuous space.

Exploiting the staggered rollout of the company across cities, our research applies a difference-in-differences design and an ==== specification using quarterly panel data from 2011 to 2016. Our results indicate that Uber’s introduction reduced by roughly 10% and 17%, respectively, traffic fatality and hospitalization rates in Brazilian cities. The results are robust to different specifications and falsification tests, and to the best of our knowledge, are the first estimates of this effect in a developing country.","New technologies are transforming urban services in metropolitan areas worldwide and are challenging urban planning and policymakers. Given their potential for affecting different dimensions of urban life, such as traffic conditions (Greenwood, Wattal, 2017, Brazil, Kirk, 2016, Hall, Palsson, Price, 2018, Barrios, Hochberg, Yi, 2018), health services (Moskatel and Slusky, 2019), and the labor market (Berger et al., 2018), using new technologies for processing spatial information associated with urban mobility of cities has become a particularly interesting field of study. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the introduction of the Uber ride-hailing service on overall traffic-related fatality and hospitalization rates in Brazil, exploiting the staggered rollout of the service across Brazilian cities using difference-in-differences and event study approaches.====Mostly based on aggregated-level data, the available evidence about the effect of ride-hailing apps on traffic safety comes from investigations of US cities. It indicates that the introduction of Uber has reduced the number of traffic deaths associated with alcohol drinking (Greenwood, Wattal, 2017, Dills, Mulholland, 2018) but increased overall traffic fatalities through an increase in use of automobiles resulting from substitution of public transportation by Uber and Liyft rides (Barrios et al., 2018). Recent evidence based on individual-level data provided by Zhou (2020) indicates that Uber’s entry positively affects binge drinking, but not drunk driving. However, given the marked institutional and socioeconomic differences between cities in the US and developing countries, it is questionable whether these results can be applied to the latter environments (Bryan et al., 2019). For example, differences associated with levels and inequality of income, degree of motorization, urban infrastructure, and traffic regulations and enforcement (Kutzbach, 2009, Gakenheimer, 1999) can bring very different possibilities and incentives for substitution of public or private transport to Uber ride-hailing services. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of ride-hailing apps on traffic safety in developing countries remains an open question.====Three main reasons make the Brazilian context particularly appealing to shed light on this gap in the literature. The first is the too high traffic-related fatality rates observed in the country. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, the rate of traffic deaths in Brazil (around 19.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) was not only much higher than the rates observed for developed countries like the US, Canada, and Germany (respectively, 12.4, 5.8, 4.1) but also higher than those observed for other Latin American countries, such as Argentina (14), Chile (12.5) and Colombia (18.5) in 2016 (WHO, 2018). Also, in Brazil, as in other developing countries, the number of private vehicles continues have high growth rates (Vasconcellos, 2005).====For instance, from 2000 to 2012, the number of vehicles jumped from 19.9 million to 40 million. This context highlights the relevance of studying urban transportation interventions in Brazil. The second reason that makes the Brazilian case interesting is that the country is Ubers second-largest market globally, only behind the US, with over 600 thousand Uber drivers and 22 million users in 2018, reaching one billion trips the same year, according to the companys website. In 2016, the largest Brazilian capital, So Paulo, was the second busiest city for Uber becoming the first in 2017.==== These numbers reinforce the growing relevance that ride-hailing services have on urban transportation in the country and make Brazilian cities an interesting context to investigate these new transportation technologies effects in the developing world. Finally, another innovation of our paper is the use of traffic-related hospitalization data, something still not explored in the literature. Again, the case of Brazil is interesting, since Brazils public health system (SUS) covers more than 70% of the population, according to the Ministry of Health, meaning that any externality caused by Uber on traffic safety is paid, at least in part, by all taxpayers.====Using official Brazilian government mortality records and data on hospitalizations from the SUS from 2011 to 2016, our set of estimates indicates that the introduction of UberX in Brazilian cities caused a 10% reduction of quarterly traffic fatality rates (per 100 thousand inhabitants), which corresponds to an average reduction of up to 1.5 deaths per quarter, considering the average city population. We also estimate a significant and substantial effect on traffic-related hospitalizations. The ride-hailing app caused a drop of about to 17% in traffic-related hospitalization rates. Our results go in the opposite direction of those found by Barrios et al. (2018) for US cities, where availability of the service increased traffic fatalities. A simple conceptual framework clarifies the potential mechanisms behind the effects of Uber’s introduction on traffic occurrences (traffic-related fatalities and hospitalizations). We explain the limitations of the mechanism behind US cities’ results, i.e., the substitution of public transportation by ride-hailing services, for the Brazilian urban context and provide evidence favoring traffic safety through a positive change in drivers’ quality.====We show that our set of estimates is not importantly influenced by the bias present in difference-in-differences strategies when there are time-varying effects, as recently highlighted by Goodman-Bacon (2018) and De Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (2020). Another potential primary challenger for our identification strategy is whether cities that received the service have different trends in traffic occurrences compared to nontreated cities before the launch of Uber. Our event study specification rules out the possibility of violation of the parallel trend assumption. Also it indicates that the effect of the ride-hailing service has been increasing since Uber’s launch, consistent with the growing popularity of the app over time, measured by Google searches for ``Uber'', as is common in the literature (Hall et al., 2018). An additional potential problem, but less likely since Uber adopted a staggered rollout strategy in Brazilian cities, is whether treated cities experienced, at the time of Uber’s entry, a shock that could affect traffic safety by other means. We address these concerns in two ways. First, we restricted our control group only to cities that received the ride-hailing service after 2016, the last year for which we have mortality and hospitalization data, and show that our results persist, reducing concerns about the influence of omitted factors. We also extended the exercise considering various other different sample restrictions and obtained quite the same results. Second, running falsification tests and permutation exercises, we showed that there had been no effect of Uber’s entry on a set of non-traffic-related deaths, and that is pretty much unlikely that our estimates just reflect the randomness of the data. Both kinds of exercises, thus, increase confidence in our estimates.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose a simple conceptual framework to explain why US’ cities results can differ from those in a developing country context. Section 3 provides information about the Brazilian urban context and details of the introduction of Uber services in Brazil. In Sections 4 and 5, we present, respectively, the database and the empirical strategy for estimating the causal effect of Uber introduction on traffic fatalities and hospitalizations in Brazilian cities. The results are presented in Section 6, together with robustness checks and falsification tests.

I estimate the mandates’ effects on housing markets. My empirical strategy exploits differences by state, year, and housing vintage. The mandates decrease the prices of old houses by 7.1 percent, acting as a large ==== on owners. Moreover, families with children become 11.3 percent less likely to live in old houses. Increases in rents for family-friendly houses suggest that the mandates have important distributional consequences. These findings are relevant for evaluating similar mandates such as healthy homes standards.","Lead poisoning is associated with reduced IQ (Ferrie et al., 2015) and educational attainment (Reyes, 2015, Aizer, Currie, Simon, Vivier, 2018) and an increased risk of criminal activity (Reyes, 2007, Reyes, 2015, Feigenbaum, Muller, 2016, Grönqvist, Nilsson, Robling, 2020, Aizer, Currie, 2019). Lead paint was extensively used in the first half of the last century, until a growing recognition of these lead hazards motivated its ban for residential purposes in 1978. The Department of Housing Development (HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development), 2011) estimates that nationwide, lead paint lingers in 5.5 million houses inhabited by small children, the population most at risk for lead poisoning, resulting in lead hazards in 21 percent of houses with small children (Dewalt et al., 2015).==== Beginning in 1971, an increasing number of states mandated abatement, i.e., control of lead hazards in older houses. Yet, abatement is expensive: (Koppel and Koppel, 1994) estimate that it can cost between $500 and $40,000, depending on the extent of the lead hazard, and funding for abatement is limited. Therefore, the mandates are analogous to a group-specific tax on buyers of old houses (Gruber, 1994).====This paper presents the first large-scale evidence on the effects of state abatement mandates on the housing market. I compare outcomes for new and old houses, which are more likely to have lead hazards, within a state before and after a mandate’s introduction, in a difference-in-differences framework that exploits identifying variation at the state-year-vintage level. My empirical analysis proceeds in two steps: first, I focus on property values to assess the incidence of the mandates on property owners; then, I analyze how the mandates affect which homes different households live in, that is their allocation across houses. To estimate the effect of the mandates on house values, I use sales data, collected by DataQuick from public deeds. To assess how households’ allocation changes with the mandates, I use data from the American Housing Survey (AHS). I examine multi- and single-family homes separately as a proxy for rental and owner-occupied homes, respectively.====The hedonic model for differentiated goods guides my empirical analysis (Rosen, 1974). Prior to the mandate, owners abate homes with low abatement costs, and households sort into safe and hazardous homes based on their willingness to pay. The mandate requires owners to further abate old houses in the presence of small children, even where it is not profitable. Thus, the mandate imposes an expected tax, decreasing property values. Abated properties recoup value over time and attract families with children as they are made lead-safe, while the value of non-remediated properties stays low.==== Therefore, long-term effects of the mandates can shed light on compliance rates in the absence of abatement data.====The transaction data show that the costs imposed by the mandates are reflected into lower house prices, although the mandates do not affect sales. Both old multi- and old single-family houses fall in value by 7.1 percent for as long as ten years. These large reductions in prices can be rationalized noting that even if a home does not present an immediate lead hazard, costly maintenance practices are needed to avoid future hazards and that reduction in prices may reduce further investments. The allocation data show that prior to the mandates, high-income families with small children disproportionally live in new houses, consistent with avoidance of lead hazards. For a few years after a mandate, families with small children are 11.3 percent less likely to live in old houses than before. Together, several robustness checks support the validity and interpretation of these findings.====The decrease in both the value of old houses and the likelihood that families with small children live in these old houses after a mandate is consistent with low rates of abatement. Under a low abatement scenario, the mandates may decrease the probability that families with small children live in old houses through both demand- and supply-side channels. On the demand side, the mandate may spread novel information on the riskiness of certain homes, steering families with small children away from old houses. This inward shift in the demand for old houses by families with small children, might decrease rents for old homes, depending on the relative elasticity of supply and demand. On the supply side, owners of old homes could charge higher rents to families with small children via price discrimination in segmented markets, or might avoid renting to these households.==== Price discrimination allows landlords to capture part of the difference in utility households attain in a leaded home vs. in a, still more expensive, unleaded home. I examine the effects of the mandates on rental prices for family-friendly homes to gather suggestive evidence in favor of supply- or demand-side mechanisms. Consistent with supply-side adjustments dominating, rents for old family-friendly houses appear to increase by 3.1–8.5 percent after a mandate.====These findings suggest that assessing the impact of the abatement mandates requires characterizing changes in the market allocation, in line with the literature on the unintended consequences of mandates (Summers, 1989, Gruber, 1994, MaCurdy, McIntyre). As households sort into homes and neighborhoods based on their utility and budget constraint (Tracey, Walsh, 2008, Kahn, 2000), they implicitly select their pollution exposure, which affects long-term outcomes (Currie, Greenstone, Moretti, 2011, Cohen-Cole, 2006, Evans, 2006, Gazze, 2016). Banzhaf et al. (2019) discuss how these demand side forces, as well as supply-side considerations and political economy factors may result in higher exposure levels for households of low socioeconomic status. In the context of lead poisoning, the principal-agent problem inherent in the landlord-tenant relation may lead to lower investments in remediation and even discrimination (Davis, 2011b). By analyzing the effects of the mandates on housing values, housing allocation, and rental prices, I shed light on how these mechanisms interact. Moreover, Banzhaf et al. (2019) highlight how the ecological fallacy may lead to measurement issues: because old houses coexist in the same neighborhood with newer homes, my granular data is key to correctly measure differential exposure risk. The estimates in this paper can be extrapolated to evaluate similar policy proposals, such as changes in housing standards and requirements for healthy homes.====This paper contributes to a growing literature studying lead poisoning prevention policies. First, Aizer et al. (2018) show that Rhode Island’s abatement mandate for all rental properties successfully decreased lead poisoning. My state-by-state analysis shows that Rhode Island is the only state where the mandate increased property values, suggesting that the state’s lead-safe certificate model is particularly effective at spurring abatement. Second, Billings and Schnepel (2017) find that federally-funded lead remediations increase home values and have tremendous returns on investments. By showing that unfunded remediation mandates decrease property values and fail to attract families with children into old homes, my findings suggest that liquidity constraints might prevent some landlords from undertaking beneficial investments. Third, Bae (2012) and Bae (2016) find that the federal mandate to disclose information about lead hazards to potential buyers and renters appears to increase buyers’ testing and reduce purchases of old homes among families with small children, but has seemingly no effect on the value of old houses. My finding that abatement mandates decrease the value of old houses may be due to abatement being perceived as more costly than disclosure or to methodological differences in the studies. By analyzing state mandates that are implemented at different points in time, I can control for localized time trends.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the potential effects of an abatement mandate in the context of a hedonic model. Section 3 provides background on the mandates I study and describes the data I use. Section 4 estimates the impact of the mandates on house prices, the allocation of households across houses, and rents.

This paper studies the relative merits of centralized and decentralized policy setting. A binding policy is optimal if the benefits from redistribution outweigh the costs from migration, which are relatively steeper for local governments. Centralized policy, though uniform in practice, reduces horizontal migration externalities, which improves decentralized minimum wage setting. Our results therefore indicate that decentralized and centralized policy setting exhibit strategic complementarity; the extent of which depends on mobility and regional heterogeneity. We then calibrate a model of the continental US and find that joint policy setting leads to a small welfare gain over centralization, and closely resembles the social planner’s optimal policies.","After Kansas City, and St. Louis, Missouri set their own minimum wages above the state level in 2017, the Missouri state legislature prohibited any city from setting its own policy. While there is likely a political motive for a red state to overturn a progressive policy in its blue cities, there are also potential economic benefits from centralized redistribution. The central government can more efficiently implement such policies when workers are mobile by internalizing spillovers, and a state may not want one of its cities to set a higher minimum wage because of the externality imposed on the rest of the state. This may justify minimum wage preemption laws in Missouri and 24 other states. However, since the state is constrained to setting a uniform policy, as in Oates (1972) decentralization theorem, then local policy setting may be preferred.====We examine optimal minimum wage setting in a federation with mobile workers to understand the relative benefits of centralized, decentralized, and joint policy setting with interregional spillovers. Which level of government should set minimum wage policies? Although our substantive focus is on the minimum wage, our framework has implications for a broad set of policies where local governments supplement federal decisions, like the EITC, income taxes, and Medicaid. Understanding the appropriate level of government decision making is increasingly important as the US federal government has continued to shift more responsibility for these policies to states (Baicker et al., 2012).====Our work most directly builds on Lee and Saez (2012), who examine the role of the minimum wage in the competitive labor market of a single jurisdiction, where workers are implicitly immobile. They find that a binding policy is desirable, even when non-linear taxes are available, if the newly unemployed have zero surplus from working and the government values redistribution to low-wage workers. In their model, workers can migrate between low and high wage jobs, though they face different costs from working in each. When a worker’s sector is fixed so that labor supply can only respond on the extensive margin, the minimum wage is second-best Pareto inefficient.==== With only one jurisdiction, their framework is unable to consider the relative merits of having different levels of government set policy as well as the externalities that result from horizontal and vertical government competition. Vertical competition in a federation is particularly important for the minimum wage because it is a price floor policy; only the higher one matters. If the central government that is restricted to a uniform policy sets a binding minimum wage in the lower wage region, then it lowers the costs associated with horizontal competition.====We adapt the Lee and Saez (2012) model to a two-jurisdiction framework with mobile agents, regional governments, and a federal government to study the trade-off presented in the decentralization theorem. Workers are not mobile across sectors, but the high-skilled are mobile across jurisdictions.==== Our goal is to understand the conditions under which setting a binding minimum wage is optimal for each type of government and analyze the welfare implications of different policy setting authorities. Local governments compete for high-skilled workers, which hinders their ability to redistribute through the minimum wage, but the central government is restricted to a uniform policy. Our stylized framework only includes two inputs for tractability, but the high-skilled can be thought of more broadly as mobile factors of production that may respond to increases in the minimum wage, like capital and firm location. In addition to the “tiered” US model of a federal uniform price floor in which states may “top off,” or raise the floor, we consider federal uniform, decentralized, and federal non-uniform policy setting.====We first provide theoretical results to understand the extensive margin decision of implementing a binding minimum wage when governments maximize social welfare. The local governments will set a binding policy if the welfare loss from unemployment is zero on the margin, and the government values redistribution to low-skilled workers more than emigration. Our conditions are the same as in Lee and Saez, except governments are concerned with policy induced migration. The federal government only cares about migration insofar as it affects total output and moving costs, leading it to have stronger preferences for a minimum wage than local jurisdictions.==== Since the theoretical model only gives predictions on the extensive margin, we proceed to calibrate a two region model to the aggregate US economy to illustrate how mobility and regional heterogeneity in productivity impact the relative benefits of centralization, decentralization, a hybrid system as in the US, and centralized non-uniform policy in general equilibrium.====The key insight from the model is that different levels of government are strategic complements in policymaking and the extent of this complementarity depends on input mobility and regional heterogeneity in productivity. Higher levels of mobility increase the costs associated with horizontal competition, while higher levels of regional heterogeneity decrease the effectiveness of uniform central policy. When jurisdictions are identical and inputs are mobile, centralized authority leads to greater social welfare while additionally allowing local governments to enact policy has no effect. However, when jurisdictions differ but inputs are immobile and therefore there are no interregional spillovers, decentralized authority is preferred. Simultaneously allowing the central government to also set a minimum wage in this case does not change the equilibrium. For the more realistic cases with heterogeneous regions and imperfectly mobile inputs, a hybrid system improves welfare since central uniform policy reduces horizontal competition and decentralized policy allows for a different minimum wage in each jurisdiction.====Regional heterogeneity in redistributive preferences may also drive differences in the minimum wage, as reflected in the Missouri example. Urban areas with high minimum wages tend to be both more productive and more progressive. We find that progressivity has a nonlinear effect on optimal policy since the minimum wage redistributes to the low-skilled from the high-skilled and the newly unemployed. A government with a very progressive social welfare function would not implement a binding minimum wage because of the negative effects of additional unemployment, while a government at the other extreme would not implement a binding policy because it does not value redistribution. Local heterogeneity in preferences can also lead to higher minimum wages. If one local government enacts a minimum wage because of its redistributive preferences, this can lead the other local government to set a binding policy, since a higher minimum wage in one region decreases the migration externality in the other.====To understand the welfare implications of tiered and centralized policy setting, we calibrate an economic geography model of the continental United States to match regional heterogeneity in productivity, high-skilled location decisions, employment, and the federal government’s optimal policy. Consistent with our earlier findings, this model predicts that tiered policy setting yields a small welfare gain over centralization alone, as it allows the federal government to more effectively redistribute from high-skilled to low-skilled workers. Even though states are heterogeneous in productivity, and high-skilled workers are fairly mobile, we also find that tiered minimum wage setting closely approximates the social planner’s optimal policies. Similar models have been used to study place based policies in general (Kline and Moretti, 2014), corporate tax cuts (Serrato et al., 2016), and income taxes Colas and Hutchinson.====While we focus on the trade-offs of different minimum wage setting authorities, the previous normative literature focused on different tax systems. Stiglitz (1982), Allen (1987), and Guesnerie and Roberts (1987) find that the minimum wage is not optimal when non-linear taxes are available, however, Guesnerie and Roberts find they may be desirable under linear taxes. The literature has also considered more sophisticated minimum wage policies in a single jurisdiction where government competition is implicitly absent, like a graduated minimum wage tied to firm size (Danziger and Danziger, 2018), in-kind redistribution (Economides and Moutos, 2017), monitoring job search Boadway and Cuff (2001), and bargaining power (Hungerbühler and Lehmann, 2009).==== Previous work on optimal tax that incorporates government competition in a federation (e.g. Wilson, 1982, Gordon, 1983, Hamilton, Pestieau, 2005, Gordon, Cullen, 2012, Dvorkin, (2017) has not simultaneously allowed governments implement minimum wages. We connect these two previous literatures by understanding optimal minimum wage policies as a tool for redistribution in a federation.====By putting the optimal minimum wage analysis into a federation, our work relates to the literature on tax competition. In our model, when a jurisdiction increases its minimum wage, high-skilled workers migrate to the other region, creating a horizontal externality that is increasing in mobility. Similar to models like Wilson (1986), and Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986) on tax competition, agent mobility will lead to low local minimum wages. By adding a federal government to the Wilson-Zodrow-Mieszkowski set-up, Keen and Kotsogiannis (2002) and Keen (2004) find vertical externalities leave state taxes too high, which is in contrast with our result that federal policy decreases the cost of local minimum wage setting. Our results are therefore more similar to Janeba and Wilson (2011) who examine local public good provision with both horizontal and vertical externalities. In their model, local provision is too low due to competition, but central provision is inefficient because it is determined by a winning coalition in the legislature. In other political economy models, like Lockwood (2002) and Besley and Coate (2003), central provision is inefficient for similar reasons, whereas it is inefficient in our framework because the federal government is restricted to a uniform policy. Our assumption is based on the US system, but this restriction does not need to hold. In May 2019, European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans called for each member of the European Union to set a minimum wage of 60% of its median salary.====Although not centered on the minimum wage, there is a complementary literature on the interaction of mobility and redistribution, beginning with Stigler (1957) and Oates (1972). Our focus in this work is on the implications of different levels of government undertaking redistribution as in Oates (1977), Ladd and Doolittle (1982), Brown and Oates (1987) and Dixit and Londregan (1998). Our approach to understanding this mechanism is similar to Epple and Romer (1991), who also use a computational model to capture general equilibrium effects. The importance of mobility for policy making in a federation has also been studied in the context of public goods (Epple, Platt, 1998, Caplan, Cornes, Silva, 2000, Calabrese, Epple, Romano, 2012, Simon),==== income redistribution (Wildasin, 1997, Armenter, Ortega, 2011, Gordon, Cullen, 2012), and higher education (Wildasin, 2000).",Optimal minimum wage setting in a federal system,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000188,18 March 2021,2021,Research Article,57.0

Finally, we show that foreclosed properties subject to a VPRO sell at higher prices when ultimately returned to the market, consistent with an underlying physical externality.","There were more than 4 million residential property foreclosures completed between the start of the Global Financial Crisis in September of 2008 and the end of 2012.==== The foreclosure crisis had detrimental effects on local housing markets. A growing body of literature has found that property foreclosures lower nearby home values (Immergluck, Smith, 2006, Schuetz, Been, Ellen, 2008, Harding, Rosenblatt, Yao, 2008, Lin, Rosenblatt, Yao, 2009, Rogers, Winter, 2009, Campbell, Giglio, Pathak, 2011, Biswas, 2012, Anenberg, Kung, 2014, Gerardi, Rosenblatt, Willen, Yao, 2015).==== The existence of foreclosure spillovers has been used to justify, in part, a number of government interventions into housing and mortgage markets, including HAMP (Home Affordable Modification Program) and HARP (Home Affordable Refinancing Program), the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), and stricter underwriting standards in the Dodd-Frank Act (2010).====Despite these interventions, the exact nature of foreclosure-related externalities remains unclear. Two plausible channels have been identified broadly in the literature. First, foreclosures may compete with non-distressed properties in the market.==== Alternatively, foreclosures may become sources of visual blight, environmental or safety hazards, or may attract crime and vandalism, which in turn may adversely affect the quality of life for households living nearby.==== Distinguishing between these different causal mechanisms is important from a policy perspective. Standard economic theory makes an important distinction between physical or “non-pecuniary” externalities, versus those caused by supply and demand shocks, so-called “pecuniary” externalities. While the former generates deadweight loss, the latter simply shifts surpluses from sellers to buyers (or vice-versa). The first spillover mechanism described above is an example of a pecuniary externality, as the pricing spillover effects are driven by the timing and nature of the foreclosure sales.==== The second mechanism affects all nearby residents, not just the seller and buyer, and thus represents a physical or true externality that potentially warrants public intervention.====Motivated by this latter concern, a number of U.S. cities passed Vacant Property Registration Ordinances (VPROs) in the aftermath of the mortgage foreclosure crisis, which require mortgage lenders to notify and register their properties with the city when they initiate a foreclosure. VPROs can ameliorate the negative spillovers from foreclosure in two ways. First, local governments can more easily monitor the foreclosure for code violations and, if necessary, intervene. Second, in most cases, the lender is obligated to monitor and maintain the property from the moment it initiates foreclosure and/or the borrower vacates the property. Crucially, this latter feature may have been especially important in judicial foreclosure states where, in many cases, the home could sit vacant or occupied by an owner without the financial means or incentives to maintain it for a significant period of time.====This is the first paper to evaluate the effectiveness of VPROs in ameliorating foreclosure spillovers. Specifically, we analyze whether VPROs enacted in the state of Florida during the late 2000s reduced the negative spillover from foreclosure using a hedonic regression framework common in the literature. We estimate housing price regressions for non-distressed homes with a rich set of geographic and time fixed effects (similar to specifications used by Campbell et al., 2011 and Gerardi et al., 2015) using data on property transactions, and allowing the effect of nearby foreclosures to vary before and after VPRO enactment.====The obvious challenge of using legislative changes to identify causal treatment effects is policy endogeneity. In this context, the concern is that municipalities that were impacted the most by the foreclosure crisis may have been more likely to pass a VPRO compared to cities that were not as adversely affected. We think this selection into treatment should work against us finding a positive effect. Cities in which foreclosures generate more of an externality should be more inclined to pass an ordinance. Still, in the absence of a compelling instrument, we employ a border discontinuity design that groups properties in VPRO cities with homes in adjacent non-VPRO municipalities that are close to the respective boundaries.====Consistent with previous results in the literature, we find evidence of a negative foreclosure externality in our sample of Florida properties, as each additional foreclosure within 0.1 miles of a non-distressed property at the time of sale lowers the transaction price by approximately 1%. Combining the border discontinuity strategy with a triple difference specification, we find that enactment of a VPRO reduces the absolute magnitude of the foreclosure spillover by 60% on average.====We show that these results are robust to several different sampling, econometric, and measurement assumptions. These include different border distance thresholds, several different sets of geographic fixed effects interacted with time dummies, restricting the sample to borders with a high number of transactions, and redefining nearby foreclosures to only include the period of time when homes are actually owned by the lender post-foreclosure. In addition, we show that the parallel trends assumption is satisfied in our context, as there are no discernible differences in foreclosure externality trends between VPRO and non-VPRO municipalities leading up to enactment. Finally, we conduct a pair of falsification exercises. In the first we set up a false border one mile inside of the VPRO municipalities, and then compare the change in foreclosure externalities for VPRO sales on each side of the fake border. In the second, we assume that the VPROs were passed two years prior to the actual enactment dates, and re-estimate our primary specification for property sales that occurred in a two-year window around the fake dates. In both cases we do not find evidence of a positive VPRO treatment effect in our “placebo” specification.====We then attempt to pin down the causal mechanism through which VPROs ameliorate foreclosure spillovers. In particular, we try to determine whether VPROs mitigate a physical externality related to poor property maintenance, or if the ordinances are somehow altering lender behavior in a way that instead mitigates a pecuniary externality.====We start by presenting evidence that the VPROs increased the values of foreclosed properties themselves when ultimately returned to the market. Using a triple-difference estimator that compares real-estate owned (REO) and non-distressed properties in VPRO and non-VPRO municipalities before and after the ordinances were enacted, we find that that VPROs raised REO sale prices by 5–11%. This finding is consistent with REO properties being in better condition when subject to a VPRO.====Next, we check to see if VPROs alter how long lenders hold on to REO properties and whether they are less likely to foreclose in the first place. VPROs could decrease the number of foreclosed properties on the market either by lenders refusing to begin the foreclosure process or by selling REO properties more quickly to avoid the costlier maintenance requirements. This would be consistent with VPROs putting upward pressure on prices through a supply channel effect. However, we find no evidence that VPROs impact the foreclosure timeline or the foreclosure probability.====Finally, we investigate the extent to which VPROs are more or less efficacious in some types of communities compared to others by stratifying our primary specification based on crime rates, income, educational attainment, poverty, population and housing density, and share of rental housing. We find that areas with higher robbery rates, less poverty, and more homeowners were less affected by a nearby foreclosure when a VPRO was in force.====Our paper makes two important contributions to the literature. It provides the first estimates of the effectiveness of the most important policy implemented by local governments to combat the foreclosure crisis. According to our data, more than 500 municipalities across the U.S. have enacted VPROs within the last two decades. We provide evidence that these policies do significantly mitigate foreclosure externalities.====Second, the apparent efficacy of VPROS informs our understanding of the mechanisms driving the foreclosure price spillovers previously documented in the literature. VPROs are designed to prevent the rapid depreciation of properties owned by financially distressed borrowers and mortgage lenders.==== While we do not have direct information on the condition of distressed properties, the weight of our evidence is most consistent with VPROs reducing a true foreclosure externality generated by property neglect rather than simply altering the supply of distressed homes on the market.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews the institutional details of VPROs. Section 3 describes our data and the manner in which we clean it. Section 4 details our econometric strategy. Section 5 replicates the existing foreclosure externality literature and presents our baseline estimates of the treatment effect of a VPRO on those externalities. Section 6 presents our check for pre-trends, two falsification exercises, and implements an alternative measure of nearby foreclosures. Section 7 tests whether REO properties themselves sell for more after a VPRO is enacted and explores whether the ordinances alter the timing of foreclosure entry or exit. Finally, Section 8 discusses external validity and identifies the type of communities in which VPROs are most effective, and Section 9 provides a brief conclusion.",Foreclosure externalities and Vacant Property Registration Ordinances,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000176,6 March 2021,2021,Research Article,58.0

Spatial proximity may lead to competition and hurt growth, but it may also improve market access and enhance growth. Using data on U.S. counties and metro areas for the period 1840–2017, we document this tradeoff between urban shadows and urban access. Proximity to large urban centers was negatively associated with growth between 1840 and 1920, and positively associated with growth after 1920. Using a two-city spatial model, we show that the secular evolution of inter-city and intra-city commuting costs can account for this. Alternatively, the long-run decline in inter-city shipping costs relative to intra-city commuting costs is also consistent with these observed patterns.","In his account of the U.S. westward expansion during the nineteenth century, Cronon (1991) writes that land speculators on the frontier saw cities as having a gravitational pull akin to a law of nature that inexorably attracted migrants from the hinterland to the new urban centers.==== This is consistent with a view that smaller places close to larger cities fall under the “urban shadow” of their neighbors, with increased competition for resources dampening their growth.==== However, there is also an opposing view: the presence of nearby clusters of economic activity improves market access, benefiting the growth of neighboring smaller places.====Is the proximity of a large urban center beneficial or harmful to a location’s economic growth? This paper empirically and theoretically explores this question. Focusing on local population growth in the U.S. over almost two hundred years, our empirical analysis identifies two distinct time periods: between 1840 and 1920, urban shadows dominated, and since then, between 1920 and today, urban access has taken over. One key force that is likely to have driven the changing relative strength of urban shadows and urban access is the evolution of intra- and inter-city commuting costs. After providing an overview of changes in commuting costs over the last two hundred years, we develop a two-city spatial model that incorporates intra- and inter-city commuting costs. We show that the long-run behavior of just one variable — commuting costs — can account for many of the observed patterns in the data, including the changing relative strength of urban shadows and urban access over time and space. Another key force we consider is the evolution of shipping costs. We show that the long-run decline in shipping costs relative to commuting costs provides an alternative explanation for the shift in importance from urban shadows to urban access.====Using U.S. county and metro population data from 1840 to 2017, our empirical analysis documents the changing correlation of local population growth with the presence of nearby large locations. In addition to establishing the important shift from urban shadows to urban access around the year 1920, we identify three more stylized facts. First, since the turn of the twenty-first century, there has been a decrease in the positive correlation between proximity to a large urban center and growth, suggesting that urban access has been weakening in the last decades. Second, there is evidence of the geographic reach of large urban centers expanding. Urban access benefits were very local between 1920 and 1940 and much more far-reaching later on. Third, the greater the size of a nearby large location, the bigger the correlation with its hinterland’s growth. The evidence therefore suggests that larger locations exerted stronger urban shadows in the earlier time period and provided improved urban access in the later period.====We hypothesize that changes in either commuting or shipping costs can account for these patterns. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, a steady stream of innovations lowered the cost of commuting. The introduction of the streetcar facilitated longer-distance commutes, giving rise to the first “streetcar suburbs”. By the beginning of the twentieth century, streetcars had become widespread. Drawing on cross-sectional data on streetcars for the time period 1900–1920, we identify one more stylized fact: improvements in local commuting infrastructure strengthened large cities’ urban shadows. The decline in commuting costs accelerated dramatically during the inter-war and post-war periods. The combination of the widespread adoption of the automobile and the building of the highway system connecting downtowns to hinterlands made it possible for people to live much further away from work. Rather than having to permanently move to enjoy the productive benefits of larger cities, people could now continue to reside in the hinterland and commute to the urban centers instead. There is some indication that the continued drop in commuting costs has weakened in the last two decades.==== Over the last century and a half, shipping costs have also experienced a secular decline. A relevant observation is that this drop in shipping costs has been more dramatic than the decrease in commuting costs (Glaeser and Kahn, 2004).====To understand the role of commuting costs and shipping costs in shaping the relative strength of urban shadows and urban access, we develop a simple model of two cities. The model captures a basic tradeoff: on the one hand, the smaller city may find it hard to survive in the shadow of the larger city, as its residents prefer to move to the more productive neighbor; on the other hand, the smaller city may thrive as its residents can access the neighbor’s higher productivity, either through commuting or through trade. In this framework, the evolution of different spatial frictions — inter-city commuting costs, intra-city commuting costs, and inter-city shipping costs — determine whether urban shadows or urban access dominate. To highlight the role of these different spatial frictions, we consider two special cases. The first ignores inter-city trade, whereas the second ignores inter-city commuting.====In the first special case without inter-city trade, an individual has three choices: she can work in the city where she initially resides, she can move to live and work in the other city, or she can commute for work to the other city without changing her residence. We then show how these choices change with the cost of commuting, the distance between cities and their relative sizes. We find that as the cost of inter-city and intra-city commuting gradually drops, we first see individuals from the smaller, less productive city move to the larger, more productive city. As commuting costs continue to fall, those individuals prefer to commute, rather than to move, to the larger city. Hence, a gradual drop in commuting costs first hurts growth in the smaller city, as it loses population to its larger neighbor, but a further drop eventually helps its growth, by attracting residents who can commute to the nearly large city. That is, the smaller city goes from experiencing a negative urban shadow, to benefiting from improved urban access.====The intuition for the non-monotonic relation between commuting costs and the growth of the smaller city is straightforward. The initial drop in commuting costs lowers the cost of living in the larger city by more than in the smaller city, for the simple reason that intra-city commutes are on average longer in the larger city than in the smaller city. This makes it more attractive for residents of the smaller city to pay the one-time moving cost to relocate to the larger city. As in Cronon (1991), the large city uses its gravitational force to pull in migrants from the hinterland. A further drop in commuting costs continues to make the larger city more attractive than the smaller city, but it also facilitates inter-city commuting, which was hitherto too costly. This allows the smaller city to attract residents who can work in the larger city. The small city benefits from the proximity of the large city.====When analyzing the observed long-run evolution of commuting costs through the lens of our model, we can account for the five main stylized facts uncovered in the data. Recall that commuting costs experienced three distinct regimes: slow decline between 1840 and 1920, rapid decline between 1920 and 2000, and stagnation since then. When interpreted by the model, these are consistent with urban shadows dominating in the early time period and urban access dominating in the later time period, with some weakening of urban access in the last decades. These effects are stronger in urban areas that experience more rapid improvements in their commuting infrastructure. The model also shows that as commuting costs decrease, the geographic reach of urban areas expands. In addition, the model implies that an increase in the relative size of a large urban center strengthens the force it exerts on its hinterland. As such, the long-run evolution of just one variable – commuting costs – is able to capture the different stylized facts, in particular the rise and decline of urban shadows.====An alternative interpretation is that urban access has improved, not because of more inter-city commuting but because of more inter-city trade. The second special case of the model aims to capture this force by introducing the possibility of trade. As before, the rise of urban shadows is driven by the drop in intra-city commuting costs, which is beneficial for both cities, but more so for the larger one. However, as shipping costs also decline, market access for the smaller city improves, giving its residents less reason to move to the larger city. If, as suggested by Glaeser and Kahn (2004), shipping costs have dropped faster than commuting costs, we show that this alternative model is also able to generate the rise and decline of urban shadows.====This paper is related to the literature that explicitly considers the spatial location of one place relative to another. Urban economics has until recently largely ignored the spatial distribution of cities (Fujita et al., 1999). An important early exception is central place theory (Christaller, 1933, Lösch, 1940). In that theory the tradeoff between scale economies and transportation costs leads to the emergence of a spatially organized hierarchy of locations of different sizes. A natural implication of central place theory is that the presence of large urban centers may enhance population growth in nearby agglomerations through positive spillover effects, but it may also limit such growth through competition among cities (Krugman, 1993, Tabuchi, Thisse, 2011).====Most empirical studies that explore the effect of large agglomerations on other locations focus on the twentieth century. They tend to find positive growth effects from proximity to urban centers. Using U.S. data for 1990–2006, Partridge et al. (2009) uncover a positive impact of large urban clusters on nearby smaller places. Looking at the post-war period, Rappaport (2005) finds evidence of the populations of cities and suburbs moving together. Dobkins and Ioannides (2001) also study the interaction of cities of different sizes. Liu et al. (2011) analyze the case of China, and likewise show that the impact of a high-tier city on its surrounding areas is positive.====A few papers have looked at earlier time periods and find evidence of urban growth shadows. In pre-industrial Europe, Bosker and Buringh (2017) show that the net effect of large neighbors was negative. Consistent with this, Rauch (2014) documents that historically larger European cities have been surrounded by larger hinterland areas. Most closely related to our work is Beltrán et al. (forthcoming) who use data on Spanish municipalities for the time period 1800–2000. They find that the influence of neighboring cities was negative between 1800 and 1950, to then become increasingly positive from 1950 onwards. Our work focuses on the U.S., a country where the urbanization process is likely to have differed from the Spanish experience for a variety of reasons: the U.S. was much less settled in the nineteenth century, modern-day mobility across cities and regions in the U.S. is greater, and the adoption of the automobile in the U.S. was swifter. In addition, our paper offers a theoretical framework that allows us to interpret the switch from urban shadows to urban access by relating it to the secular decline in transport costs.====In this paper we do not consider the possible role of structural transformation in explaining the absorptive capacity of large locations. If the biggest cities disproportionately benefited from the rural exodus from nearby counties, this would generate an urban growth shadow. While plausible, a recent paper by Eckert and Peters (2018) on spatial structural change since 1880 finds little support for this alternative explanation. More specifically, it finds that the spatial reallocation of people from agricultural to non-agricultural labor markets accounted for almost none of the decline in agricultural employment since 1880. Instead, most of the structural transformation happened within counties. Hence, while our data do not allow us to take a strong stand on the possible role of structural transformation, this paper suggests it might not be a first-order driver of our stylized facts.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical findings on the changes in urban shadows and urban access over the period 1840–2017. Section 3 documents the evolution of commuting costs over the same period. Section 4 proposes a conceptual framework that relates the evolution of commuting and shipping costs to urban shadows and urban access, showing that the theoretical predictions are consistent with the main patterns in the data.

We investigate the effect of litigation on the time and cost of constructing housing and other real estate developments in Mumbai.==== Although there is a significant literature in the United States and other developed countries on the causes and costs of construction delay there have been few studies that look at construction delays in cities in developing countries where most urban growth is going to happen and none, to our knowledge, focusing on litigation. Our paper fills this lacuna.====Litigation is caused by poorly defined property rights. If we define a property right as the exclusive authority to determine how a resource is used then property rights in Indian cities are poorly defined not simply because of a lack of title or confusion over metes and bounds but because the regulatory authority and Public Interest Litigation have combined to create a system with large numbers of veto players such that no one has exclusive authority.==== Public Interest Litigations (PILs) were meant to give civil society the power to take up causes on behalf of marginalized groups but we find that self-interested groups have used PILs and the complexity of the regulatory process empowers NIMBY’s (Not in My Back Yard) and rent seekers. In short, the complexity of the public regulatory process has been amplified by private litigation. In the real estate sector, developers are often the target of such suits by citizen-activists, sometimes fronting other developers, who become veto players. The accumulation of veto players slows decision making and raises costs (Olson, 2008; Tsebelis, 2002; Heller, 2010). The low state capacity of the Indian courts compounds the problem by making delay and the threat of delay, rather than winning a case, the goal of the litigation.====As per the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index, India ranks fifth from the bottom out of 190 countries for time required for enforcing contracts. It takes 1445 days (or around 4 years) to enforce a contract in India.==== The National Judicial Data Grid of India, which is maintained by the Government of India, estimates that there are 27.6 million pending cases in the Indian Court System with 53.2% and 24.4% of these cases pending for more than two years and five years respectively.==== Cases that last decades are not uncommon, especially in property disputes. A Daksh (2016) survey of around 9000 litigants conducted in 2016 found that 66% of all civil cases were land and property disputes.====A useful measure to understand the effects of delays is the regulatory tax (Glaeser et al., 2005a; Brooks and Lutz, 2016; Cheshire and Hilber, 2008). The regulatory tax measures the difference between house prices and the marginal cost to produce additional built-up space. Cheshire and Hilber (2008) estimate the regulatory tax rate for offices in London to be close to 4. Glaeser et al. (2005a) estimate the regulatory tax rate for Manhattan at approximately 2 circa 2002 and they find that the regulatory tax is correlated with delay. For Mumbai, IDFC-Institute (2018) estimates the regulatory tax rate to be between 3.5 and 4. According to Glaeser et al. (2005a p. 334), the regulatory tax along with supply restrictions could arise due to ====.====Delays in construction have been documented in developed countries due to regulation (rather than litigation).==== Gyourko et al. (2008) conducted a survey of municipal officials across the United States and found that on average it took six months to get approvals to start a project. After getting approvals, it takes two months to start the project and six months more to complete the project (Bahadir and Mykhaylova, 2014). Thus, on average it takes as long to get approvals as to construct the project. Using a model, Bahadir and Mykhaylova (2014) show that delays have an amplifying effect on demand shocks, leading to an increase of 31% in the volatility in house prices. Paciorek (2013) finds that the elasticity of supply reduces by 0.26 with an increase of one standard deviation in delays. Mayer and Somerville (2000) show that regulations, such as approval processes for obtaining building permits, which lead to delays in construction reduce mean housing starts by up to 45% and cities with more such regulation have lower price elasticity of supply compared to cities that have more relaxed regulation. As noted, the focus of our study is on a developing country where most urbanization is happening.====This paper uses data from three sources: quantitative data from the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) of Maharashtra and the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), and qualitative data from the Bombay High Court. The public data from RERA includes details of projects including estimated completion times and whether the project is under litigation. From the MCGM database, we find actual completion dates for a smaller sample of cases. We cross reference a small number of litigations from RERA’s database to cases in the Bombay High Court to find qualitative information about the nature of the disputes. We use these cases to understand the underlying reasons for litigation.====Our baseline model uses OLS to estimate the effect of litigation on estimated completion times. One key concern is potential reverse causality arising because developers are sued when there is a delay in completion. We are able to partly address this by dropping projects with cases in the consumer redressal courts, which is where these disputes are heard.====We supplement the OLS model using matching techniques to identify projects that are similar in terms of observed covariates that could affect estimated completion times. Notably, we are able to exactly match on many variables.====While on average projects have very lengthy completion times, projects under litigation take even longer to complete. Our baseline OLS results show that for all of Mumbai, projects under litigation have around 19–20% longer estimated completion times compared to projects without litigation. The average treatment effect using nearest neighbor and propensity score matching is very similar.====We conduct a number of robustness checks. A possibility of overstating the end date may arise if developers feel that they would attract a penalty or criticism for not completing the project within the stipulated date of completion. However, there is a natural check for this action, given that projects having very long completion times will have lower market values. We use a smaller dataset of completed projects available from the MCGM to check for consistency with the larger dataset. Using actual data of completions we find very similar results, namely litigation increases completion times by about 20%. We also make use of an instrumental variable, which measures the neighborhood propensity to sue. It measures the mean time to completion of projects under litigation in neighborhoods leaving out the project in question. The leave-out measure is highly predictive of litigation. The IV estimates of the delay caused by litigation are about twice as big as our OLS and matching estimates which suggests that our preferred estimate of a 20% increase in time to completion is conservative.====This paper comprises eight sections including the introduction. Section 2 provides background regarding regulations and litigation in land and real estate markets in Mumbai. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 describes the baseline specification and the results. Section 5 discusses the robustness checks. In Section 6 we estimate the cost escalation due to litigation and discuss some of types of cases being brought against projects in Section 7.

There is, however, little empirical evidence to support the Troesken hypothesis. Using city-level data published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for the period 1906–1938, we explore the relationship between water purification efforts and the Black-White infant mortality gap. Our results suggest that, while water filtration was effective across the board, adding chlorine to the water supply reduced mortality only among Black infants. Specifically, chlorination is associated with a 9 percent reduction in Black infant mortality and a 10 percent reduction in the Black-White infant mortality gap. We also find that chlorination led to a substantial reduction in the Black-White diarrhea mortality gap among children under the age of two, although this estimate is measured with less precision.","Today in the United States, Black infants are more than twice as likely to die within the first year of life than their White counterparts (Aron 2013; Riddell et al., 2017). Although the Black-White infant mortality gap has existed since at least the turn of the 20th century, when reliable mortality data by race first became available, its causes are still being researched and debated today (Ewbank 1987; Collins and Thomasson 2004; Almond et al. 2006; Elder et al., 2016; Speights et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2020a).====This study is the first to explore whether the adoption of clean water technologies (i.e., water chlorination and filtration) at the municipal level can explain the evolution of the Black-White infant mortality gap during the first decades of the 20th century, a period when urban mortality rates—especially infant mortality rates—were in steep decline (Cutler and Miller 2005; Anderson et al. forthcoming). Previous studies provide evidence that the construction of filtration plants led to substantial reductions in infant mortality (Cutler and Miller 2005; Anderson et al. forthcoming), but these studies do not provide estimates by race.====In ====, Troesken (2004) famously hypothesized that, because urban Blacks and Whites lived in close proximity to each other at the turn of the 20th century and drew upon the same sources of drinking water, the adoption of clean water technologies led to an improvement in the relative health of Blacks.==== The negative and statistically significant association between water filtration and typhoid mortality among Blacks living in major American cities documented by Troesken (2002, 2004) supports this hypothesis, but typhoid deaths were only a small proportion of total deaths during the first decades of the 20th century and never amounted to more than half of mortality from diarrhea/enteritis (Anderson et al. forthcoming), the leading cause of infant mortality. Whether, and the extent to which, water purification efforts contributed to the evolution of the Black-White infant mortality gap is still an open question.====Using newly transcribed infant mortality data by race on 17 major American cities for the period 1906–1938, we find mixed evidence with regard to the Troesken hypothesis. Specifically, we observe a strong negative association between water filtration and infant mortality among both Blacks and Whites. By contrast, there is no evidence that chlorination reduced White infant mortality; among Blacks, however, chlorination is associated with a 9% reduction in infant mortality. Adding chlorine to the water supply is also associated with a 10% reduction in the Black-White infant mortality gap and a 22% decrease in the Black-White diarrhea/enteritis mortality gap among children under the age of two, although it should be noted that this latter estimate is not statistically significant at conventional levels.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Initially after the intervention, we observe a large housing gap in favor of treated units. As a result, non-treated households’ aspirations to upgrade their housing increased sharply relative to the treatment group, echoing an aspiration to “keep up with the treated Joneses”. The aspirational effect is mostly observed among dwellers residing in urban slums, with relatively high levels of income, and located close to treated neighbors. However, after 2 years of treatment exposure, the aspirational effect completely disappears and no effects are found on ","Slums are typically associated with hopelessness. Poor housing quality and inadequate access to safe water and sanitation trap a majority of slum residents in poverty, most of whom find themselves stuck in slums for generations. Still, as argued by Glaeser (2011), slums provide tremendous economic opportunities for the poor. Slum dwellers move there with the aspiration to escape subsistence-level rural poverty, and to take advantage of the benefits of agglomeration, economies of scale and networks offered by large cities. Glaeser (2011) is also aware of the severe resource constraints faced by slum dwellers, and recognizes that, while it would be a mistake to overlook the economic opportunities that slums provide for the world’s poor, it would also be a mistake to idealize them. He warns us that, even though slums are places of opportunity, they are also places of public failure that can frustrate the aspirations of their residents.====Slum-upgrading interventions have shown to be effective at improving housing, health, and the subjective well-being of their beneficiaries (Cattaneo, Galiani, Gertler, Martinez, Titiunik, 2009, Marx, Stoker, Suri, 2013, Gonzalez-Navarro, Quintana-Domeque, 2016, Galiani, Gertler, Undurraga, Cooper, Martinez, Ross, 2017). Moreover, these interventions are expected to be more cost-effective than they appear as we generally do not account for any positive housing externalities. In particular, non-beneficiary neighbors who care about social status are now encouraged to invest in housing improvements in order to “keep up with the Joneses”, thereby increasing the neighborhood’s housing quality by an even larger margin. As such, slum-upgrading interventions are thought to be a promising policy tool to boost the living standards of slum dwellers. They are expected to raise housing aspirations and stimulate progressive housing upgrading over time====However, the pass-through from improved neighborhoods to higher housing aspirations to higher housing investment may not be that direct, especially in contexts of extreme poverty like slums, where the means required to satisfy higher aspirations are scarce. Indeed, material deprivation may itself dampen aspirations and lead to lower levels of effort which, in turn, may lower material outcomes, creating a vicious downward cycle. Internal constraints such as low self-esteem, stress, depression, and hopelessness can also frustrate aspirations and thus make the poor less willing to take forward-looking actions to exit poverty (Appadurai, 2004, Bertrand, Mullainathan, Shafir, 2004). More generally, in the presence of resource constraints that thwart attempts to achieve aspirations, aspirations may have to be adjusted downward to relieve the resulting frustration (Selten, 1998, Selten, 2001 and Karandikar et al., 1998)==== This begs the question of whether housing programs increase the poor’s housing aspirations and whether higher housing aspirations are sufficient to trigger housing investment or, in contrast, housing aspirations adjust downward as resource constraints frustrate aspirational achievement.====We examine this question in the context of a housing quality experiment in Latin American slums. Our study population consists of severely poor households that have been “trapped” in urban and rural slums for many years and thus have unusually low housing aspirations. Following standard models of peer effects, we test how the housing aspirations and housing investment of untreated units react over time to positive exogenous shocks to the housing quality of some of their neighbors. We use data generated by a large-scale multi-country randomized field experiment in El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay. The housing program is run by TECHO, an NGO that offers improved housing to slum dwellers in more than 20 countries throughout Latin America. For identification, we exploit experimentally generated variation in housing quality at the household level combined with exogenous variation in the length of exposure to treatment.====The experiment went as follows. A number of eligible slums were randomly sampled within each country and a baseline survey was implemented. Overall, aspirations were very low. While around 10% of household heads aspired to improve their housing conditions, the remaining 90% showed no hope. Then, within each slum, a set of randomly chosen families received new houses, while others did not. The randomly introduced housing improvement serves as an exogenous shock to the gap in housing quality between treated and untreated co-residents. This allows us to determine whether being exposed to larger housing gaps encourages the control group neighbors to increase their housing aspirations and housing investments relative to their treatment counterparts==== Importantly, there is as-good-as-random variation in the length of exposure to the treatment at the slum level, which allows us to compare the housing aspirations and housing investment of those exposed to a longer period of treatment exposure (24 months on average) to the aspirations and investment of those exposed to a shorter period (16 months on average). We causally identify (i) whether changes in housing aspirations among control units in the short-run translate into higher housing investment in the long-run; and (ii) how persistent are housing aspirations over time. Our paper differs from previous analyses on aspirations (Beaman, Duflo, Pande, Topalova, 2012, Glewwe, Ross, Wydick, 2018, Macours, Vakis, 2014, Bernard, Dercon, Orkin, Taffesse, et al., 2014, and Lybbert and Wydick, 2016) in that none of the earlier experiments are based on the kind of data that would make it possible to test whether aspirational effects change as a result of adaptation over time.====We first show that, at baseline, there was no gap in material circumstances nor in housing aspirations between the treatment and control groups, and this is also the case when comparing those residing in slums with long versus short exposure to the treatment. Then, after 16 months of treatment exposure (short-run), we find that the control group’s housing quality is significantly lower than that of the treatment group, with no other noticeable material differences between these groups. The program is effective at improving housing conditions among the treated, with no effects found on incomes, savings, assets, or labor supply. We also find that the probability of aspiring to upgrade housing conditions within urban slums is 56% higher among control units than in the treatment group==== In other words, the housing gap was internalized by control households, whose members now aspire to “keep-up with the treated Joneses”. In contrast, no aspirational effects are found in rural slums. Since rural slums are substantially poorer compared to urban ones, we hypothesize that large living-standard gaps with respect to reference (treated) neighbors constrained the development of housing aspirations among rural controls. This is consistent with the theoretical work of Ray (2006) and Genicot and Ray (2017). In line with Glaeser (2011), a complementary hypothesis is that aspirational effects are only observed in urban slums due to a positive interaction between better neighborhood housing quality and city level effects, i.e., it is the exposure to cities that makes the within-neighborhood housing gaps an inspirational device that raises urban dwellers’ housing aspirations.====Importantly, even though housing aspirations increased among urban control units after 16 months, we do not observe increases in their levels of housing investment, suggesting that housing aspirations might not be a good predictor of housing investment in resource-constrained environments. In fact, we find that after eight additional months of treatment exposure (i.e., 24 months on average), neither treatment nor control groups increased housing investment, and this is the case for both urban and rural slums. In other words, the housing gap across experimental groups remained constant over time, meaning that higher aspirations among control households went unfulfilled. Indeed, we find that the initial aspirational effect observed in the urban control group completely vanishes. Higher housing aspirations did not translate into housing investment but adapted downward over time. Our results are consistent across the three country experiments, as well as for different measures of housing aspirations, which lends credibility to the external and construct validity of the results. Extrapolation achieved through estimation of a structural model of aspiration adaptation suggests that the housing aspiration effects declined in proportion to the number of months of indirect exposure to the treatment. We find that these effects became indistinguishable from zero after 28 months, for a rate of aspiration adaptation of 38% per month. Crucially, the adaptation effect is explained entirely by adaption in the control group, as the treatment group’s housing aspirations remain invariant over the entire period of analysis. Furthermore, since external constraints such as low incomes, savings, assets, and labor supply remained constant over time in both groups, the adaptation in controls’ housing aspirations cannot be explained through changes in other material means.====We also examine heterogenous effects across the income status of slum dwellers. While both high- and low-income households display initial aspiration effects, the adaptation effects differ substantially across subsamples. For instance, the adaptation effect exhibited by control units in the low-income subsample is more than three times greater compared to their counterparts in the high-income subsample, suggesting that income matters for the course and persistence of housing aspirations.====Finally, we examine spatial heterogeneities. We exploit exogenous variation in the distance to treatment units for the Mexican subsample, where we gathered GPS data on the location of experimental units. TECHO beneficiaries cannot choose the location for their new house, which can only be built on the plot the household occupies at the time of the TECHO offer. Therefore, the geographic proximity to treatment units is orthogonal to baseline household locations in any given slum. Indeed, the Euclidean distance from treatment units provides exogenous spatial variation in the level of exposure to the housing program. This allows us to identify causal differences in the evolution of housing aspirations and housing investment over time between those located close to and far from treated neighbors, and thus test for spatial housing externalities. Our results show that most of the initial aspirational effects come from urban households located relatively close to the treatment units, suggesting positive spatial externalities on housing aspirations. The effect fully vanishes over time via significant downward adaptation. In contrast, treatment proximity did not trigger higher housing aspirations among control households in rural slums, but generated the opposite effect: controls stopped aspiring to upgrade their housing conditions. This is, again, consistent with Ray (2006) and Genicot and Ray (2017)’s hypothesis that large living-standard gaps with respect to reference groups can induce frustration among the very poor====Overall, our evidence suggests that the poor are trapped in an aspiration failure equilibria not because they lack the capacity to aspire to higher living standards (Appadurai, 2004), but because they lack the capacity to sustain higher aspirations. Indeed, in excessively resource-constrained environments like slums, encouraging housing aspirations that are not attainable may not lead to housing investment. Instead, higher aspirations will tend to adapt over time. Note that the welfare effects associated with the adaptation of aspirations are mixed. On one side, the adaptation of aspirations may generate inaction among the poor, which contributes to the persistence of poverty over time. On the other side, higher aspirations are theoretically painful for individuals, and are only translated into utility gains once they are satisfied (Genicot and Ray, 2017). Hence, a fast decay of aspirations might not be negative in terms of welfare, but a strategy that allows individuals to minimize the utility costs associated with dissatisfaction, especially when those aspirations are ==== unreachable.====Second, the aspiration adaptation result casts doubts on the long-run effectiveness of slum-upgrading interventions. Place-based policies designed to encourage private investment are likely doomed to fail if the majority of slum dwellers are not capable of translating higher levels of housing aspirations into effective housing investment. This is the case for residual (non-universal) housing policies like TECHO which by design does not reach all households in targeted slums, thus generating inequalities that instead of triggering investment among non-beneficiaries end up thwarting their housing aspirations. This calls for the design of more inclusive interventions that give all slum dwellers the chance of improving their material conditions in any given slum, thereby increasing housing aspirations and housing investment evenly across the neighborhood.====Third, our evidence points to the importance of long-term follow-up to intervention studies focusing on subjective outcomes such as aspirations or happiness. In particular, the aspiration adaptation result warns against claims of development responses based on outcomes following a policy change but observed only in the very short run. As suggested by Jayaraman et al. (2016), “once the euphoria dies down, such effects may vanish” (====. 318). Consequently, testing for long-run effects becomes critical, making it necessary to implement research designs that track responses over time. A notable exception in this regard is (Harari and Wong, 2017) who study the long-run effects of KIP, a massive slum-upgrading program in Indonesia that provided public goods like roads and sanitation to local residents between 1969–1984. The authors monitored progress for more than 30 years following treatment implementation, finding that the KIP intervention decreased land values and slowed down housing development. Moreover, they find that the treated areas are more likely to have stayed informal and have higher population density====Finally, our paper contributes to the literature on aspirations and happiness. Kahneman (1999) argues that increases in aspirations can negatively affect subjective well-being, a phenomenon he calls the “satisfaction treadmill”. If such a treadmill exists, the author suggests that “at any level of objective happiness, people with a higher aspiration level will report themselves less happy and less satisfied than others whose aspirations are lower” (p.16). Galiani et al. (2018) show that TECHO beneficiaries were initially more satisfied with their housing quality, but a significant portion of these gains adapted downward over time. We test the “satisfaction treadmill” hypothesis by extending their analysis and studying how housing satisfaction among controls evolved across phases.====In particular, the satisfaction treadmill hypothesis implies that the initial increases in housing aspirations among control units pushed down their levels of housing satisfaction, and the subsequent downward adaptation in their housing aspirations pushed back their housing satisfaction to the initial (higher) levels. However, we show this is not the case. First, we find that housing satisfaction among control units experienced only small and insignificant variations over the period of analysis. Second, we find that the housing aspirations of urban treatments remained almost invariant over time, and thus the downward adaptation in their levels of housing satisfaction is unlikely to be explained by changes in housing aspirations, but most likely due to hedonic adaptation mechanisms. This result is relevant for two reasons: (i) it rejects the satisfaction treadmill hypothesis, suggesting that changes in aspirations are not followed by changes in subjective well-being, at least for the case of poor populations like slum dwellers; and (ii) it reinforces the idea that aspirations and subjective well-being should be examined as two distinct welfare dimensions, each of which merits a separate analysis.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

In Sections 3 and 4, we discuss the construct validity of our aspiration measures and introduce the identification strategy used to estimate causal adaptation effects.

I explain the positive correlation observed between slum growth and economic growth in cities with three IV-estimated structural elasticities. The number of low-income households in a city increases with wages with an elasticity of 1.7. Housing rents increase with housing demand with elasticities of 0.37 for non-slum housing and 0.07 for slum housing. Economic growth in cities thus causes slum growth because it attracts large number of low-income households who face higher rent growth for non-slum than slum housing. I further show that as economic growth improves households’ incomes nationwide, an income effect reduces the national slum share. Finally, I find that two policy-relevant counterfactuals significantly increase aggregate income by relocating households into high-wage cities: 1) slum upgrading in high-wage cities 2) reducing the elasticity of non-slum housing rents to housing demand shocks.","One third of urban households in the developing world either experience overcrowding or live without adequate water, sanitation, and homes made of durable construction materials (UN, 2015). Several studies have documented the negative impacts of slum living conditions on slum households’ health, labor supply, and investment decisions, raising concerns about slums acting as an urban poverty trap (Ashraf, Glaeser, Holland, Steinberg, 2017, Field, 2005, Field, 2007, Galiani, Schargrodsky, 2010, Galiani, Gertler, Undurraga, Cooper, Martínez, Ross, 2017, Kesztenbaum, Rosenthal, 2017). There is also evidence that the unplanned and informal nature of slums leads to inefficient land use in cities (Harari and Wong, 2018, Henderson et al., 2020). A third and less explored concern about urban slums is that slum disamenities may prevent households from migrating to enjoy the higher wages offered in urban areas (Duranton, 2008, Lagakos, Mobarak, Waugh, 2018, World Bank, 2009).====Two main trends characterize the evolution of slums in the developing world in the last few decades. First, the absolute number of urban slum households has been increasing, reaching 880 million in 2014, with economically dynamic cities frequently experiencing the highest slum growth rates (UN, 2015, World Bank, 2009). Second, the share of slum households in the total number of urban households has been declining steadily around the world, falling from 39% in 2000 to 30% in 2014 (UN, 2015). The first contribution of this paper is to document and explain these basic trends on slum growth by studying Brazilian cities between 1991 and 2010.====The second contribution is to quantify the aggregate effects of improving the living conditions in slums and the affordability of non-slum housing in Brazil’s high-wage cities. In a spatial equilibrium setup, urban costs in high-wage cities reduce the size of these cities and, through this channel, decrease aggregate income. Duranton and Puga (2019) and Hsieh and Moretti (2019) show that housing regulations play such a role in the US by increasing housing rents in high productivity cities. In developing countries, poor slum living conditions and expensive non-slum housing in high-wage cities could have a similar spatial misallocation effect.====Studying the causes of slum growth and the aggregate effects of improving slum living conditions in high-wage cities requires accounting for the links between slum and non-slum housing markets both within and between cities. For instance, rapid economic growth in cities often leads to massive relocations of households from other cities and rural areas. These movements potentially impact cities’ slum and non-slum housing rents, leading to further equilibrium effects on households’ location decisions. Similarly, improving living conditions in slums may affect non-slum housing markets as well as rural-urban migration decisions. This paper takes these links into account by estimating and solving for the equilibrium of a system of cities model with two types of households (low and high income) and two types of houses (slum and non-slum).====In the model, households choose their city and housing type depending on cities’ wages and on the level of rents and amenities of each city and housing type. This decision defines the supply of labor to each city and the demand of housing for each housing type in each city. The housing supply side of the model features two separate housing supply equations for slum and non-slum housing. I estimate the model using census data on wages, rents, and the distribution of households in slum and non-slum housing for the universe of Brazilian cities in 1991 and 2010. To consistently measure slums over space and time, I adapt the definition of slum housing used by the United Nations (UN), focusing on “unserviced” housing that lacks both basic water and sanitation services.====I estimate the key structural parameters of the model with instrumental variables. On the housing demand side, these parameters are the elasticities of the population of low- and high-income households in a city with respect to real wages in that city (wages net of housing rents). I identify these parameters with Bartik (1991) wage instruments computed separately for low and high-income households. On the housing supply side, the key structural parameters are the elasticities of slum and non-slum rents with respect to housing demand shocks. These parameters are inverse housing supply elasticities and I identify them with instruments that shift the demands of slum and non-slum housing. A Bartik (1991) wage shock attracts low-income households to cities, shifting the demand for slum housing, and identifying the respective housing supply. A Card (2001) migration shock shifts the demand for non-slum housing and identifies the respective housing supply.====With respect to the first contribution of the paper, I use the set of estimated structural elasticities to explain the observed positive correlation between economic growth and slum growth in cities. The population of low-income households in a city increases with real wages with an elasticity of 1.7. Rents increase in reaction to housing demand shocks with elasticities of 0.37 for non-slum housing and 0.07 for slum housing. Economic growth in cities thus leads to slum growth because higher urban wages attract large numbers of low-income households who face increasing rents of non-slum relative to slum housing. I further show that when urban economic growth becomes strong enough to raise households’ incomes nationwide, an income effect reduces the national share of urban households in slums. Taking the population share of high-income households in 2010 (35%) back to its 1991 level (25%) increases the share of slum households in the total urban population from 17.5% to 20.2%.====The second contribution consists in quantifying the aggregate benefits of improving slum living conditions and non-slum housing affordability in high-wage cities. Both interventions increase aggregate income by attracting low-income households to high-wage cities. With respect to the role of slum living conditions, I implement a counterfactual in which I increase slum amenities by one standard deviation in the 20% of Brazilian cities with the highest wages. This counterfactual increases the national average of low-income wages by 1.1 log point. Given the great popularity of policies improving slum amenities across the developing world (UN, 2003), this counterfactual points to the previously unexplored role of the spatial distribution of these policies on countries’ levels of income. With respect to the role of non-slum housing affordability, I find that reducing the response of serviced housing rents to housing demand shocks by ten percentage points (0.37 to 0.27) decreases the average growth of serviced housing rents between 1991 and 2010 from 18.6% to 14.2%. Lower non-slum rents allow low-income workers to relocate into high-wage cities, increasing the national average wage of these workers by 3.0 log points.====This paper contributes to the existing literature in four main dimensions. First, a large body of literature on the evaluation of slum upgrading programs has focused on the impact of improving slum living conditions on different relevant aspects of slum households’ behavior and welfare (Ashraf, Glaeser, Holland, Steinberg, 2017, Field, 2005, Field, 2007, Galiani, Schargrodsky, 2010, Galiani, Gertler, Undurraga, Cooper, Martínez, Ross, 2017, Kesztenbaum, Rosenthal, 2017, Lanjouw, Levy, 2002). I contribute to this literature by improving our understanding of why slums form in the first place and illustrating how slum upgrading efforts can have quantitatively relevant impacts beyond those for current slum residents.====Second, by looking at the effects of housing markets on workers’ location and, therefore on a country’s level of income, this paper also contributes to the misallocation literature (Bryan, Morten, 2019, Fajgelbaum, Morales, Suárez Serrato, Zidar, 2019, Hsieh, Klenow, 2009, Hsieh, Moretti, 2019). The hypothesis relating slums and spatial misallocation has been present in the urbanization literature (Duranton, 2008, Lagakos, Mobarak, Waugh, 2018). Duranton (2008) assumes that dual housing markets imply higher urban costs and shows how this leads to smaller cities with lower wages. Lagakos et al. (2018) show that poor housing conditions in urban slums in Bangladesh reduce rural-urban migration, leading to lower wages and welfare for migrant households. My paper contributes to this literature by quantifying the spatial misallocation consequences of slum disamenities on national levels of wages and welfare.====Third, the paper also contributes to the literature on the determinants of slum growth (Brueckner, Selod, 2009, Cai, Selod, Steinbuks, 2018, Cavalcanti et al., 2019, Feler, Henderson, 2011, Henderson et al., 2020, Jimenez, 1985). An early theoretical literature, as in Jimenez (1985) and Brueckner and Selod (2009), highlighted the individual and social costs and benefits of squatting in a single-city setup and showed the resulting trade-offs faced by squatter organizers and city authorities. Feler and Henderson (2011) showed that the existence of houses without water in Brazilian municipalities could be related to incumbent residents’ efforts to try to avoid the negative externalities generated by low-income migrants. Cai et al. (2018) and Cavalcanti et al. (2019) calibrate models of a single city with slums and study counterfactual slum policies. More recently, Henderson et al. (2020) estimate a model with slum and non-slum houses for the case of Nairobi and quantify the misallocation losses due to slums’ inefficient land use. My paper’s focus on the role of system of cities’ interrelated labor and housing markets for understanding slum growth complements these previous works, which are focused on a single city. This paper also innovates over the previous literature by integrating slum growth modelling with plausible causal identification of the model’s key structural parameters. In particular, the (inverse) housing supply elasticities I estimate for slum and non-slum housing are, to the best of my knowledge, the first of their type.====Fourth, this paper’s general equilibrium model with spatially mobile agents and a close connection between the model and the data contributes to the recent quantitative spatial economics literature (Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, Wolf, 2015, Baum-Snow et al., 2020, Caliendo, Parro, Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, 2014, Diamond, 2016, Donaldson, 2018, Fajgelbaum and Redding, 2018). Within this literature, I use modelling and estimation techniques that are most closely linked with Diamond’s (2016) work. This paper critically extends Diamond’s work by solving for the equilibrium of the system of cities model. This allows me to account for how shocks to a specific housing market affect the market for the other type of housing (serviced or unserviced) as well as dual housing markets in other cities.====The paper starts by presenting its data sources in Section 2. Section 3 describes Brazil’s general context between 1991 and 2010 and presents some basic descriptive facts on slum and non-slum housing in Brazilian cities. Section 4 introduces the spatial equilibrium model. Section 5 describes the empirical methodology, discussing the main identification concerns and presenting the identification strategy. Section 6 presents the estimation results, and Section 7 solves for the equilibrium of the model for a set of counterfactual scenarios. Section 8 concludes by summarizing the paper’s contributions and discussing some directions for future research.",Slum growth in Brazilian cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000097,23 January 2021,2021,Research Article,63.0

Applying ==== provided by TNCs in Austin. Together these results suggest that while TNCs may impose modest ==== externalities, restricting or taxing TNC activity is unlikely to generate large net welfare gains through reduced congestion.","Transportation network companies (TNC) like Uber and Lyft have grown rapidly over the past decade to become integral parts of urban transportation systems. A small but growing literature has attributed to these companies benefits that include billions in annual consumer surplus (Cohen et al., 2016), reductions in drunk driving (Greenwood and Wattal, 2015), and flexible work (Judd, Krueger, 2016, Angrist, Caldwell, Hall).====The costs of TNC expansion, however, have yet to receive commensurate treatment in the economics literature. Most notably, TNCs have been accused of contributing to traffic congestion (San Francisco Transit Authority, Schaller Consulting), but existing studies of the impact of TNCs on congestion are few, arrive at varied conclusions, and do not quantify the implied congestion costs (Li, Hong, Zhang, Erhardt, Roy, Cooper, Sana, Chen, Castiglione, 2019). Back of the envelope calculations suggest these costs could be substantial. A 2017 Inrix report, for example, placed the annual cost of congestion to US drivers at $305 billion (Inrix, 2017)—roughly two orders of magnitude larger than estimates of national consumer surplus provided by Uber (Cohen et al., 2016). This suggests that if TNCs have even a modest impact on traffic congestion, the negative externalities associated with lengthening travel times could offset consumer surplus benefits. Understanding how and whether TNCs impact traffic congestion therefore plays a crucial role in determining appropriate policy response to the continued growth of these companies.====Two identification problems, however, make causal inference difficult when studying the relationship between TNC activity and traffic congestion. First, Uber and Lyft likely select entry locations based on trends in city-level characteristics unobservable to the econometrician. Comparisons that leverage differences in TNC entry dates across locations may therefore suffer from reverse causality. Second, within-city time series regressions may be biased by omitted variables (e.g., gentrification) which are serially correlated with TNC activity and also impact congestion.====In this paper I leverage a natural experiment in Austin, TX to circumvent these identification challenges: On May 9====, 2016, both Uber and Lyft unexpectedly exited Austin following a vote that upheld a city ordinance requiring driver background checks. I combine this variation in TNC activity with novel and granular Bluetooth traffic speed data, and setting-specific estimates of the value of travel time to answer two research questions. First, do transportation network companies impact traffic congestion? And if so, what are the travel-time related costs or benefits of TNC operation?====This setting informs two empirical strategies: a difference in differences comparing pre- versus post-May 9==== traffic speeds in 2015 (where both companies operated year round) to 2016 (where both companies exit on May 9====), and a regression discontinuity in time. Across specifications, I find evidence of modest increases in traffic speeds following the exit of Uber and Lyft. Difference in differences results suggest that across all hours, traffic speeds increased roughly 1% following the exit of Uber and Lyft. 7 am. to 7 p.m. traffic speeds increased by 2.3%, with the largest TNC-related slowdowns occurring during the middle of the day (11 a.m. to 2 p.m.). Using setting-specific estimates of value of the travel time, I calculate that Austinites would be willing to pay roughly $33 to $52 million annually to avoid these slowdowns. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that these figures are a small fraction (4–6%) of total Austin-area congestion costs, and are roughly the size of estimates of the consumer surplus associated with TNC operation in Austin.====These findings improve on the existing literature in three ways. First, this is to my knowledge the only paper to use the exit of Uber and Lyft to study the impacts of TNCs on congestion. This translates to weaker identifying assumptions than those imposed in analyses leveraging the staggered expansion of these companies. Second, I extend existing analyses by mapping changes in travel speeds to changes in travel time costs, providing the first estimates of the congestion costs associated with TNC activity. And third, the spatial and temporal granularity in the Bluetooth data allows me to perform analyses that contribute to a more complete picture of the heterogeneous impacts of TNC activity on traffic congestion.====These findings also provide several important takeaways for policymakers. First, TNC activity can be viewed roughly as a transfer, as the consumer surplus enjoyed by TNC passengers is of similar size to the time loss incident on incumbent drivers. Second, it is difficult to rationalize TNC quantity restrictions purely on welfare grounds, as the lost consumer surplus may outweigh travel time gains. In other words, even if TNC regulation is more politically achievable than are price-based congestion controls, TNC regulation appears (at least in the Austin case) to be a poor tool to address congestion-related externalities. Relatedly, the relatively modest impacts of TNCs on traffic congestion in Austin suggest that congestion taxes targeted specifically at ridesharing companies are unlikely to result in large traffic-related welfare gains. Lastly, the fact that speeds slow in response to TNC activity suggests TNCs add vehicles miles traveled (VMT) to the transit system. In other words, the VMT avoided by sharing rides are outweighed by additional trips induced by the availability of TNCs.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

By 2010, the disparity had flipped: 24.7==== of urban men and 30.6==== of the urban/rural smoking disparity. Alternatively, differential tobacco control policies explain only 9.6==== selects into rural communities.","Where a person lives is increasingly predictive of their health and longevity. For example, Chetty et al. (2016) document significant variation in life expectancy at the commuting zone level and argue that most of this variation is due to lifestyle differences. Chief among these lifestyle behaviors is cigarette smoking, which is the largest preventable cause of death in the United States and which is increasingly isolated regionally (HHS, 2014). In 1956, 52==== of men living in urban areas and 42==== of men living in rural areas smoked cigarettes (Haenszel et al., 1956), yet by 2010, while the prevalence of smoking was dramatically lower for both groups, the disparity had flipped: 24.7==== of urban men and 30.6==== of rural men smoked and similar patterns exist for women (American Lung Association, 2012). Rarely do such disparities flip, and understanding how and why such changes occur is important when considering policies aimed at reducing inequality, especially given the well-known longevity (Doll, Peto, Boreham, Gray, Sutherland, 2004, Darden, Gilleskie, Strumpf, 2018) and health care cost (Xu et al., 2015) implications associated with smoking.==== The leading public health explanation is that place-based policy differences have generated differences in smoking prevalence. For example, while state plus local (county and municipal) cigarette taxes were very similar in the 1980s and 1990s, a $0.40 (in 2014 dollars) gap emerged by 2014 between urban and rural counties.==== Taken together, trends in smoking and cigarette taxes are generally consistent with a story in which local area tobacco control policies have caused the urban/rural smoking disparity, and a growing public health literature advocates federal tobacco control policies that compensate for state and local areas that “lack the resources or political will to implement and enforce local policies that decrease initiation and increase cessation” (Doogan et al., 2017).====In this paper, I study the urban/rural smoking disparity with geocoded data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 Cohort (NLSY79). I demonstrate that the urban/rural smoking gap emerged years prior to any meaningful differences in real state and local cigarettes tax rates. To evaluate alternative mechanisms behind regional smoking disparities, I estimate a dynamic system of equations model that captures smoking behavior, location decisions, and education over thirty years. The estimated model allows me to simulate how the distribution of observed and unobserved variables shift over time and across space and to compare the implications of these shifts to those associated with place-based differences such as cigarette taxes. I begin by simulating the estimated model while assigning the mean urban state and local cigarette taxes in each year to anyone selecting a rural location. This simulation amounts to a roughly 30.4==== increase in the mean rural cigarette tax by 2014. I find that the 2014 urban/rural smoking gap shrinks by 9.6==== with rural smoking declining by 2.9==== or 0.67 percentage points. Importantly, results from this simulation imply that equalizing mean cigarette taxes through Federal legislation would not dramatically alter regional smoking disparities. Instead, I find that composition changes in local populations explain more of the urban/rural gap. For example, the share of those rural residents especially unlikely to smoke, as measured by the distribution of permanent unobserved heterogeneity, declines by 8.0==== between 1984 and 2014. A simulation of the estimated model in which I do not allow individuals to sort between rural and urban areas reduces the 2014 urban/rural disparity by 31.9==== roughly three times more than equalizing cigarette taxes across space. A further simulation in which I equalize unobserved permanent heterogeneity ==== restrict migration such that the compositions of urban and rural areas do not change explains 70.9==== of the 2014 urban/rural smoking disparity.====Taken together, the results from reduced-form and quasi-structural models suggest a limited causal role for tobacco control policies; instead, I find that the evolving compositions of urban and rural areas drive smoking differences. Those raised in urban areas are less likely to continue smoking and more likely to remain in urban areas and seek higher education; migrants from rural to urban areas are more likely to achieve higher education and less likely to smoke relative to those remaining in rural areas. These results suggest that expanding existing tobacco control policies in rural areas would have only a modest effect on smoking disparities, consistent with recent evidence that rural communities are less supportive of indoor smoking restrictions (Stillman et al., 2018). In fact, over the long-run, tobacco control policies are themselves selected: these endogenous local area measures reflect urban smoking attitudes, which may have evolved differently as the compositions of urban areas evolved.====These results connect at least four strands of economic literature with an important public health problem. First, skill-selected migration (Roy, 1951, Borjas, Trejo, 1992) may change local area smoking prevalence to the extent that smoking is correlated with skill and skilled workers migrate to high returns to skill urban areas.==== For example, Borjas et al. (2018) demonstrate that Danish emigrants are positively selected both on (observed) earnings and (unobserved) ability; if either of these characteristics are correlated with smoking behavior, then migration patterns may shift smoking prevalence within local areas. Importantly, while interstate migration is low in the United States (Kaplan, 2017), a simple extension to the skill-selection literature suggests that net changes in smoking prevalence may be driven both by smokers moving out of urban areas and non-smokers moving out of rural areas. I find a robust correlation in the unobserved heterogeneity that jointly drives smoking, location, and education decisions.====Second, to the extent that agglomeration economies exist because urban proximity enables ideas to translate into faster human capital accumulation (Glaeser, Mare, 2001, Glaeser, Gottlieb, 2009), urban smokers may quit smoking at higher rates because the health consequences of smoking are more salient or because greater human capital implies a larger cost to reduced health and longevity (Grossman, 1972). For example, the slow diffusion of understanding about the health risks of smoking during the latter half of the twentieth century connected faster with more educated smokers (de Walque, 2010), which may have generated regional smoking disparities to the extent that, on average, urban populations are of higher education. However, I find little evidence that moving to an urban area causes smoking cessation; instead, I find that individuals who move from rural to urban areas are more likely to be nonsmokers regardless of location.====Third, this paper contributes to the “brain drain” literature by pointing out that valuable skills, and their empirical proxies such as education and test scores, are correlated with a wide variety of behaviors and outcomes whose compositions within local areas may also change with migration, even if these factors do not directly cause migration. The brain drain theory says that skill-selected migration causes low returns-to-skill source locations to lose highly skilled workers (and potentially gain low-skilled migrants), decreasing the skill composition of the local workforce.==== At the same time, migrants selected on skill may also shift the political, economic, health, and social compositions of local areas. For example, Hillygus et al. (2017) argues that migration away from high-cost urban centers in the northeast may substantially shift the political composition of states in the U.S. South. Indeed, Docquier and Rapoport (2012) argue that skill-based ==== brain drains are becoming an increasingly important feature of 21st century globalization. Yet migration need not be driven by returns to skill. Young (2013) shows that differential skill prices are not needed to generate skill composition shifts if workers select on unobserved individual characteristics that are correlated with education.====Finally, this paper relates to an important literature on both the health effects of migration and the historical role of cities in determining health behaviors. For example, Black et al. (2015) show that Blacks migrating north during the Great Migration of the early 20th century were positively selected on both education and income, and yet they experienced lower longevity than those choosing to remain in the United States south. Their primary explanation for this surprising finding was the differential prevalence of health behaviors among migrants. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System between 1984 and 2010, they show that for Blacks born in the south between 1916 and 1932, cigarette smoking and heavy drinking were the lowest among those choosing not to migrate. Similarly, Johnson and Taylor (2019) study rural to urban migration in the mid-20th century and show that migrants were positively selected but died younger because of higher rates of cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol consumption. These studies mirror evidence from Haenszel et al. (1956) that, historically, the prevalence of smoking was higher in urban areas, and that migration played a role in the changing health compositions of local populations.",Cities and Smoking,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000012,21 January 2021,2021,Research Article,65.0

To estimate transportation’s effects on county employment and wages, I develop a new ==== strategy: isolating market access growth caused by incidental connections to rural counties. I find that through market access highways increased employment, had small and delayed wage effects, and that instruments correct for downward bias. A structural model interprets reduced-form results as agglomeration and congestion forces strengthening after 1980. Counterfactual simulations suggest that Interstates’ effects were highly heterogeneous and that additions to early Interstate plans were less valuable than the system’s core.","Does improving a region’s market access improve its local economy, and at what cost? This question underlies some of the world’s most ambitious public works projects. Highway networks such as India’s Golden Quadrilateral, China’s National Highways, and America’s Interstate Highway System all aim to promote national growth, but can concentrate these gains in a handful of cities. To better understand if, when, and how transportation affects regional economic development, I estimate the Interstate Highway System’s (IHS) effects on U.S. counties’ market access and economic activity.====The Interstate Highway System is an ideal test case for studying transportation infrastructure’s long-run effects. It is a comprehensive highway network that greatly improved upon existing roads to reduce both commuting and shipping costs. Both of these channels can benefit regional economies directly and by fostering agglomeration economies, but endogeneity concerns and measurement issues have made separating these channels difficult.====I overcome these challenges using panel data on U.S. county incomes and employment, the national highway network, and a measure of market access. Guided by a general equilibrium trade model, I measure each county’s market access as a travel time discounted sum of other counties’ incomes. In theory, market access captures transportation’s equilibrium effects, and I find that its empirical counterpart varies independently of local road density. I use this variation to distinguish the effects of commuter highways and market access on county employment and wages. To identify market access’ causal effects, I develop a new instrumental variables strategy that uses its weighted average structure to exploit details of early IHS plans. Finally, I calibrate a structural model to investigate changing patterns of agglomeration over time and to assess the value of recent additions to the IHS.====My empirical analysis identifies inter-city highways’ local effects using previously unexploited details of early IHS plans.==== In particular, I use the fact that early IHS plans explicitly prioritize a number of cities. Prioritized cities were disproportionately prosperous and endogenously became Interstate hubs, but their market access varies exogenously with travel times to whichever counties were en-route between them.====To identify causal effects, I control for priority city status and instrument market access with planned access to incidentally connected counties. I exclude connections between priority cities to adapt the inconsequential units approach described by Redding and Turner (2015). I extend upon prior applications of the inconsequential units approach, which can only identify causal effects for rural counties, by isolating exogenous variation in market access of both rural counties and major cities. For rural counties, instruments vary with planned highway construction rather than endogenous post-hoc extensions. For major cities, they vary with incidental connections to rural counties. Conditional on observables mentioned in early IHS proposals, I identify market access’ effect on economic activity in both rural counties and major cities to form a basis for comparing local benefits of targeting lagging regions with national costs of diverting focus from commercial and industrial hubs.====Econometric estimates generate three main conclusions. First, I find that improving a county’s market access increases their long run income, mostly by increasing employment. Second, comparing alternative instrumental variables strategies suggests that highways improved market access in counties that would have otherwise grown less than average. Third, I find evidence for changing mechanisms over time and argue that local productivity spillovers and housing costs became more important determinants of economic outcomes after 1980.====From 1953 to 1980, when most IHS expansion occurred, market access increases employment with no effect on wages. Most of the associated wage effects materialize after 1980. Combining these periods, I find that market access had large effects on county employment and modest effects on wages in the long run. From 1953 to 2010, a standard deviation increase in an average county’s market access growth increased their employment growth by a quarter of a standard deviation and increased their wage growth by just one seventh of a standard deviation.====I interpret these results in a Ricardian trade model featuring mobile labour, agglomeration economies, and endogenous housing costs. In the model, counties produce differentiated goods and draw good-specific productivities from a single distribution as in Eaton and Kortum (2002). Counties differ in which goods they produce most productively and each have a distinct comparative advantage, encouraging trade, but trade is costly. Highways enter the model by reducing trade costs, which depend on inter-county travel times. To consider the role of local externalities, I assume that both housing costs and firm productivity increase with city size.====The model interprets market access’ large long run effects on employment and wages as evidence that agglomeration spillovers strengthened and housing supply tightened over time. In this static model, market access’ short run effects (from 1953 to 1980) map to structural parameters that are consistent with existing literature (Eaton, Kortum, 2002, Combes, Gobillon, 2015, Donaldson, Hornbeck, 2016) but the model requires large agglomeration and congestion elasticities to rationalize market access’ larger long run effects on employment and wages.====The model also reveals substantial geographic heterogeneity in the market access and employment counties owe to Interstate Highways. A counterfactual that closes Interstates to inter-city travel dramatically changes equilibrium market access and suggests that the interquartile range of counties’ employment attributable to the IHS is 16 percent of 2010’s median county employment.====Finally, I ask whether extensions to the 1947 highway plan benefited households as much as the Interstate Highway System’s key routes. These additional highways sometimes cross sparsely populated areas or abruptly become slower secondary roads; studying them gives insight into the value of continued highway expansion and trade-offs inherent in targeting lagging regions’ market access. Counterfactual welfare simulations suggest that, on a per kilometre basis, extensions to the 1947 highway plan are worth approximately one fifth of their planned counterparts. Further, I find that states’ counterfactual employment losses from removing unplanned highways are imperfectly correlated with unplanned highway density and are attenuated in states whose neighbours built unplanned roads. This raises the possibility that building highways to improve lagging regions’ market access benefits them at other places’ expense.====These findings contribute to the literature studying transportation’s role in promoting regional integration and economic activity. In particular, I complement reduced form evidence from Chandra and Thompson (2000), Michaels (2008), and Frye (2014) in the United States, Ghani et al. (2016) in India, and Faber (2014) in China. These studies have mixed findings, but often suggest that highways redirect economic activity.====I also bring a new identification strategy to the literature studying market access’ effect on regional economic activity. Previous studies in this vein include Donaldson and Hornbeck’s (2016) analysis of American railroads, Alder et al. (2017) in India, Jaworski and Kitchens (2016) in Appalachia, Jedwab et al. (2017) in Africa, and Baum-Snow et al. (2017) in China. In contrast to the Chinese experience of highways and market access hurting peripheral areas, I find that market access helped America’s hinterlands and find no evidence that access to hinterlands and major hubs has different effects on average county outcomes.====Finally, I add to the literature on Interstate Highways’ economic effects. Early studies restricted attention to rural counties to identify highways’ effect on employment, finding some evidence of spillovers between neighbours (Chandra and Thompson, 2000) and increasing trade related activities (Michaels, 2008). I find that market access increases employment more than wages which is consistent with Chandra and Thompson’s (2000) conclusions and in contrast to Michaels’ (2008) model with immobile labour. Others find that by improving metropolitan commuting, Interstates caused suburbanization (Baum-Snow, 2007) and employment growth (Duranton and Turner, 2012).

This paper provides evidence that a pre-colonial indigenous trail influenced the location of modern cities in southern Brazil. To distinguish the causal effects of historical settlement near the trail from the effects of geographic fundamentals that could correlate with it, I compare how population density and urbanization change with proximity to the trail in two different regions. The first region has been settled by Europeans since the 16==== century, while European settlement in the second region was interrupted after a 17","Although widespread urbanization is a modern phenomenon, the distant past often influences the location of modern cities (Bleakley and Lin, 2012, Michaels and Rauch, 2018). The European conquest and settlement of the Americas is a compelling setting to further examine this influence. First, the continent has a well-developed network of cities today, but most cities appeared only after the European arrival. The emergence of cities in the Americas is thus relatively recent, historically well-documented, and suited for an investigation, although still relatively unexplored.==== Second, the European conquest led to a drastic reorganization of economic activity across the continent due to population losses, an influx of new technologies, and the emergence of trade links with Europe and Africa. These changes likely affected the benefits of locating in alternative sites, in which case geographic features of the pre-colonial economy may have little impact on modern city location.==== Is the influence of the past strong enough to outweigh these changes? If so, what are the mechanisms behind this influence?====This paper presents evidence that a pre-colonial indigenous trail influenced the location of modern Brazilian cities. In particular, I show that proximity to a system of indigenous paths known as the Peabiru is associated with higher modern-day population density and urbanization in areas of the Brazilian states of Paraná and São Paulo. This positive association holds only in a region that has been settled by the Portuguese since the 16==== century. The association does ==== hold in a nearby region that was settled at the same time by the Spanish, was later invaded by the Portuguese, and remained mostly abandoned until the 20==== century. The comparison between the patterns in the two areas suggests that the concentration of modern cities along the Peabiru is due to path dependence and not due to unobservable geographic fundamentals that correlate with proximity to the Peabiru. The findings also suggest that the geography of modern railroads was influenced by the Peabiru and that the influence of the ancient trails on later transportation infrastructure may explain some, but not all, of the effects on population density and urbanization.====The Peabiru was a trail system that connected the Atlantic coast in Brazil to the Andes. It crossed parts of what are now the modern Brazilian states of Paraná and São Paulo. Its strategic importance was recognized as early as 1525, when it was first traversed by an European conquistador, attracting settlement efforts from both Spain and Portugal. In fact, at around the same time during the 16==== century, the Portuguese and the Spanish began the settlement of different parts of the region. Historical evidence shows that the Peabiru and the native villages that surrounded it were important considerations for the location choice of both Portuguese and Spanish settlements. In 1628, however, increased demand for slaves in Brazil led the Portuguese to organize a slave raid into the Spanish area. Spanish towns were militarily attacked and abandoned. The raid also reduced the local native population, the majority of which was either captured, died or fled. Moreover, the area was not subsequently occupied by the Portuguese, being settled by Euroamericans only when it became a frontier region in the 20==== century (Kohlhepp et al., 2014). Hence, the invasion and abandonment of the Spanish area effectively interrupted any influence that pre-Columbian populations had on its future settlement. I use this natural experiment to construct a counterfactual of what city location would be in the region that has been continuously settled in case the settlement had been interrupted. This counterfactual allows me to identify a causal effect of history on city location that works through proximity to the Peabiru.====I infer the causal effects of history by estimating a difference-in-differences model where treatment is ==== to the Peabiru in the region that was occupied only by the Portuguese, not by the Spanish. Hence, I identify these causal effects by the difference between the coefficient on proximity to the path in the continuously settled Portuguese region relative to the coefficient in the previously abandoned Spanish one.====The identification assumption here is that correlations between ==== geographic fundamentals and proximity to the Peabiru would be equal in both regions and, in case the correlation was different than zero for a fundamental, its importance for the density of economic activity would also be the same in both regions. By documenting the correlations between ==== fundamentals and proximity to the Peabiru, I assess the plausibility of the identification assumption. Based on the historical reasons for the settlement of the study region, I consider a long list of fundamentals. The list includes altitude, ruggedness, agricultural suitability, suitability for malaria, vegetation, soil type, and access to water. In either region, I find no association between proximity to the indigenous path and the geographic fundamentals. These findings suggest that, in the setting under study, the difference-in-differences I use is an adequate and even conservative identification strategy.====The results on different measures of the modern distribution of economic activity, such as population density, urbanization, and satellite nighttime lights, confirm the hypothesis that the concentration of economic activity around the indigenous path reflects a causal relationship. Consider urbanization: only 5.8% of the sample is urban, but being closer than 10 km to the Peabiru increases this probability in 5.1 p.p. conditional on being in the Portuguese area. In the Spanish region, however, there is no change in urbanization with distance to the Peabiru.====The main results are robust to a variety of concerns. The results are qualitatively similar when the dependent variables are in levels or in logarithms, when I use alternative measures of proximity to the Peabiru, and in different samples. Moreover, the inclusion of a large set of observable geographic fundamentals as control variables does not seem to affect the estimated effects.====I also investigate the channels behind the effects. Since the Peabiru was an ancient transportation network, some of its influence on population density could have been a consequence of its influence on later transportation networks. Therefore, I estimate the influence of proximity to the Peabiru on proximity to modern transportation infrastructures. The estimates indicate a clear and strong influence of the Peabiru on the railroad network, while the influence on the more recent and dense road network is less clear and likely weaker. These results suggest some persistence in the geography of the transportation network, but also that newer transportation networks were less affected by history. They also suggest that there is a role for modern transportation infrastructures, particularly railroads, in explaining the concentration of modern cities near the Peabiru. This role is consistent with the historical importance of railroads for city emergence and growth in the region. However, the influence of the Peabiru on modern railroads does not seem large enough to completely explain the effects on population density. Instead, agglomeration economies and coordination around settlements established during the colonial period plausibly explain some of the effects of history that are associated with proximity to the pre-Columbian path.====My main contribution is to the empirical literature on the emergence of cities. There is an extensive literature on the emergence of European and Middle Eastern cities; see Bosker et al. (2013), Bosker and Buringh (2017), Michaels and Rauch (2018), Blaydes and Paik (2019), and Cermeño and Enflo (2019). With the exception of the emergence and evolution of United States cities since the 19==== century (see Desmet and Rappaport, 2017, Carter, Nagy, 2020), much less is known about city appearance and growth in the Americas. Studies of the persistence of the spatial distribution of economic activity in the continent usually focus on a coarser geographical unit of analysis, such as countries or states (Acemoglu et al., 2002; Maloney and Valencia Caicedo, 2016). A recent exception is Alix-Garcia and Sellars (2020), who document the changing relative importance of different geographic fundamentals in Mexico since the early colonial period. To the extent of my knowledge, my paper is the first to identify a causal effect of geographic features of pre-Columbian societies on the modern spatial distribution of economic activity. In this way, my findings complement and help to interpret the previous studies documenting a positive correlation between past and present agglomerations.====A second contribution is to a literature that studies the long-run effects of ancient roads. Wahl (2017) shows positive effects of Roman rule on modern economic activity in Germany and argues that some of the effects are due to the effects of Roman roads. Dalgaard et al. (2020) examine the effects of Roman roads, showing that, in Europe, higher Roman road density leads to both higher road and population density today. Burghardt (1969) is a study on how the indigenous trails in Canada’s Niagara Peninsula gave way to a modern road network. In that context, the persistence of indigenous paths was limited. I find a limited effect on the location of modern roads, but a large effect on railroads, urbanization and population density. Therefore, my findings show an intermediate picture between the patterns identified by Wahl (2017) or Dalgaard et al. (2020) and the lack of persistence described by Burghardt (1969). My findings also suggest that different transportation infrastructures could be affected differently by ancient roads.====I also contribute to a growing literature that documents in which cases geographic fundamentals do not uniquely dictate the spatial distribution of economic activity; among others, see Davis and Weinstein (Davis, Weinstein, 2002, Davis, Weinstein, 2008), Brakman et al. (2004), Miguel and Roland (2011), Bleakley and Lin (2012), Schumann (2014), Michaels and Rauch (2018), Brooks and Lutz (2019), and Barsanetti (2020). My contribution to this literature is to show the long-run impacts of ancient second-nature features in an American context, despite many subsequent changes in the importance of first-nature geographic fundamentals and a large depopulation shock after the European arrival.==== In other words, the New World was not a blank slate on which the modern distribution of economic activity would be unaffected by its pre-Columbian past. Moreover, my paper contributes to this literature by investigating persistence in transportation infrastructure as an explanation for the long-run effects of history on the spatial distribution of economic activity.====Finally, this paper relates to a literature on the effects of European colonization. Some papers have shown persistent effects of colonial investments on the spatial distribution of economic activity or the direction of trade; see Jedwab and Moradi (2016), Jedwab et al. (2017), Bonfatti and Poelhekke (2017), or Dell and Olken (2020). I study how settlement decisions were influenced by a pre-colonial geographic feature, affecting the modern distribution of economic activity. Moreover, this paper is related to Nunn and Puga (2012), which also examines how a historical slave raid relates to modern economic geography.====Section 2 provides a historical background on the setting and the natural experiment I examine. Section 3 describes the main data sources I use. Section 4 outlines the identification strategy and presents the main empirical results. Section 5 examines how the Peabiru influenced the modern road and railroad networks. Finally, Section 6 concludes with the main takeaways from this paper.",Cities on pre-Columbian paths,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300887,31 December 2020,2020,Research Article,68.0

Attracted by productivity gains and amenities in cities, firms and individuals congregate in urban areas and compete for space, attributing to outward expansion of cities. With the proliferation of automobiles, the surge in traffic on roads inevitably leads to congestion, an ubiquitous problem many cities around the world faces. These traffic delays affect London as well. Average on-road commuting speed in the 1990s was slower than that at the beginning of twentieth century before car travel became prevalent (Newbery, 1990). By 2002, travel speed for motor vehicles during morning peak hours fell by almost 30% compared to that in 1974, from 14.2 to 10.0 miles per hour, and drivers spent, on average, 27.6% of their on-road time stationary (Department of Environment and the Regions, 1998).====Traffic is also a major source of air pollution. According to figures from Environmental Protection Agency, automobiles contribute to more than 50% of the nitrogen oxide, 30% of the volatile organic compounds and 20% of the PM10 in US.==== These emissions have detrimental effects on health outcomes, increasing infant mortality, reducing birth weight and inducing premature births (Currie, Walker, 2011, Knittel, Miller, Sanders, 2016). Heavier traffic can also increase the risk of traffic accidents and fatalities (Li, Graham, Majumdar, 2012, Green, Heywood, Navarro, 2016). It is evident that traffic externalities are undesirable and can affect the attractiveness of neighbourhoods, influencing household location decisions.====This paper measures the average marginal willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid negative traffic externalities (e.g noise pollution, traffic exhaust, elevated traffic accident risk and congestion delays) using the housing market. Because an explicit market for traffic does not exist, the hedonic approach is broadly adopted in the literature to value this non-market amenity.==== The idea is that traffic varies across space and, holding all other factors constant, differences in home values should reflect the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid traffic. While the concept is simple, attempts to estimate the casual effect of traffic on home prices are fraught with difficulties. First, traffic is not randomly distributed across space and the heaviest traffic is usually around the city center where economic activities are congregated. Unobserved neighbourhood differences between properties across space are likely to confound the estimates. Second, more affluent households who incur costlier time delays could sort themselves from congested neighbourhoods to reduce commuting time. The concern is whether the WTP to avoid traffic could be confounded with the WTP for better neighbourhoods.====Bearing these challenges in mind, this paper exploits the substantial but localised changes in traffic conditions induced by the London Congestion Charge (LCC) to recover the cost of traffic. The charge boundary is drawn around the city centre to alleviate congestion from the most gridlocked roads in London. A flat fee of £5 is imposed for driving into the charge zone during weekdays from 7:00am to 6:30pm. This Pigouvian tax forces drivers to internalize the congestion externalities they impose on others. Closing the gap between the marginal private cost and the marginal social cost of driving, the LCC reduces equilibrium traffic volume and pushes it closer to socially optimum level (Pigou, 1924, Vickrey, 1963). The effects were immediate. Six months into implementation, the volume of cars into Central London fell by 27% and average travel speed was 20% higher than before (TfL, 2003a).====Estimation is based on a difference-in-difference instrumental variable (IV) approach for sales around the charge boundary. I rely on the implementation of the LCC as an IV for changes in local traffic conditions and examine its effect on house prices. Put differently, I am exploiting the sharp variation in traffic conditions in and around the zone induced by the charge. I then compare the changes in traffic flow with the changes in house prices before and after the LCC is implemented to recover WTP estimates to avoid traffic. To obtain consistent estimates for these parameters, the charge must not only significantly affect traffic flow, but it must also influence house prices only via changes in traffic conditions (also known as exclusion restriction).====I identify several possibilities that this assumption could be violated and adopt different strategies to mitigate them. First, unobserved shocks to neighbourhoods could be correlated with the enforcement of the LCC. Hence, I restrict the analysis to sales close to the charge boundary (up to 500 m) such that I am comparing properties in similar neighbourhoods but at different sides of the charge boundary. Second, home purchasers could pay more to relocate into the charge zone because residents living inside enjoy a 90% waiver to the charge. Exploiting sales that are entitled to the discount but are outside the charge zone, I demonstrate that these subsidies have a negligible effect on home prices. Furthermore, affluent households, who incur higher cost for being caught in the traffic, could sort themselves into the charge zone. These households could purchase better quality units, affecting the composition of houses sold after the charge is enforced. Conducting a battery of balancing tests on a rich set of housing and neighbourhood characteristics, I do not find households sorting across the boundary, and any changes in the composition of houses sold after the charge is enforced.====The headline finding is that homeowners moving into the charge zone pay more to enjoy better traffic conditions. After the LCC is implemented, traffic volume is 8.77% lower (1562 fewer vehicles every day) relative to neighbourhoods outside the charge zone, illustrating the efficacy of the charge in reducing traffic. Corresponding to this improvement in traffic conditions, home prices are approximately 2.84% (£18,555) higher in the zone. Putting these results together, the instrumental variable (IV) estimates suggest that the elasticity of housing values with respect to traffic volume is around ====0.30. These estimates remain stable and significant across a battery of robustness tests. Multiplying these capitalization gains with the number of dwellings in the charge zone, I document that the LCC has generated substantial windfall of more than £3.8 billion for homeowners in the zone. This gain measures the present value of the local benefits associated with the LCC. Further analyses reveal that these house price gains could stem from safer roads and better air quality after the charge is enforced.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview on the Congestion Charge in London. Section 3 describes the existing literature on this subject. Section 4 outlines the data and Section 5 illustrates the identification strategy.

Such exemptions represent substantial intergenerational transfers and may have important implications for local public finances. The consequences of age-based property tax exemptions depend upon the extent to which they influence households' location decisions, housing tenure decisions, and housing consumption. We provide the first evidence on (long-term) changes in household composition and housing consumption attributable to local, age-based property tax exemptions. We construct a unique database of local property tax exemptions in Georgia covering 100 years of county, school district, and selected city property tax laws. We use these data to estimate the effect of age-based property tax exemptions on the number of older homeowners from 1970–2010 attributable to the exemption. Using a ""quadruple-difference"" estimation strategy, we find a significant increase in older homeowners attributable to the combined effect of age-based property tax exemptions on location decisions and housing tenure. We also find evidence that age-based property tax exemptions increase housing consumption among older households. Finally, we estimate a sorting model to estimate the equilibrium effects of different tax policies.","As the largest single source of revenue for state and local governments in the United States, property taxes are a primary funding mechanism for local public goods and services. Yet this tax base has eroded over time, as local governments enact exemptions, abatements, and other concessions (Augustine et al. 2009). Age-based property tax exemptions are part of this trend. Across the United States, many local jurisdictions offer property tax exemptions or similar concessions to older citizens, especially from taxes supporting school districts.====Such exemptions first attracted the attention of tax professionals some fifty years ago (e.g., Chen 1965), but they have become much more widespread in recent decades. For example, in the state of Georgia, in 1970 only about 5% of the population lived in a local jurisdiction with some kind of age-based property tax exemption, whereas today it is more than 80% (though they vary in generosity and the population covered). As of 2018, 20 states and the District of Columbia provide some level of property tax exemption or credit for seniors, and six give local jurisdictions the option of increasing the exemptions generosity. Further, an additional ten states give local jurisdictions the option of providing these exemptions. In addition to the exemptions and credits, thirty-nine states have at least one program for seniors to defer property taxes, freeze assessments or property taxes, or property tax circuit breaker Lincoln Institute (2020).====Such exemptions are controversial. For example, in suburban Atlanta, Cobb County has made headlines for its generous exemption from the education property tax for seniors at a time when schools' budgets have been severely squeezed (Davis 2010, Downey 2013). Defenders of age-based exemptions argue that housing makes up a larger share of the budget for older households, that many older households paid into the community for many years, and that most presently do not have children in the schools. From this perspective, exemptions effectively reduce the public service subsidies from older households (Shan 2010, Gallagher et al. 2018). Additionally, age-based exemptions may help older residents remain in their homes, increasing neighborhood stability. Critics point out that, on the other hand, most older households do not have mortgages, that they benefit from the increased housing values associated with strong schools and other public services, that other households with no children in the schools are not exempted, and that today's seniors benefited when they were younger from receiving the payments of the previous generation of older households.====In addition to their direct effect on the tax base, age-based property tax exemptions may also have unintended consequences in the form of changes in jurisdictional household composition and changes in housing values. These changes could, in turn, have a “dynamic scoring” effect on local public finances. That is, the effect of senior discounts on local public finances may be different in the long run if the discounts increase the share of older homeowners. Recently, Gallagher et al. (2018) examined the effect on local school finances of an exogenous increase in the population of older households. They consider two effects, the tax base effect, which represents the transfer of resources from households without school-age children, and the tax rate effect, as the political process generates lower tax rates (for all households) in jurisdictions with more older households. They find the former effect dominates. However, they do not consider the effect of age-targeted tax exemptions, which essentially represent a way to reduce the tax base effect.====The decrease in the cost of homeownership in a particular location granted by age-based property tax exemptions potentially influences eligible households through three channels. First, age-based exemptions could affect the location decision of older homeowners, as they have an incentive to move to areas with more generous exemptions (or refrain from moving away). Second, such exemptions similarly could affect the tenure decision of older homeowners, as they have more incentive to own their property than to rent. Third, at the intensive margin, the tax subsidies could induce older homeowners to consume more housing, much like the mortgage income tax deduction Hanson (2012). Tiebout sorting and migration studies provide mixed evidence regarding the effect of taxes and public goods on the location decisions of older households, but there is substantial evidence that households generally move in response to changes along these dimensions. There is less evidence on the potential for age-based exemption-induced increases on the extensive margin in the number of households owning a home and on the intensive margin in the size of the house, or amount of housing capital.====To our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide evidence on the effect of local age-based property tax laws on local changes in household composition through the differential location and tenure decisions of older households as well as the effect on housing consumption. To do so, it uses a unique, newly constructed database of local property tax exemptions in Georgia. The data cover 100 years of county, school district, and selected city property tax laws. We use these data to estimate the effect of age-based property tax exemptions on the percentage change in the number of older homeowners from 1970–2010 that is attributable to the exemption.====We use a ""quadruple-difference"" estimation strategy that uses counterfactual information from jurisdictions without exemptions as well as young owners and older renters in the treated counties to identify the effect on older homeowners. Computationally, we estimate difference-in-differences, looking at changes in the demographics of counties that adopt age-based property taxes relative to changes in counties that didn't. However, relative to a standard difference-in-differences model, we allow the residuals to be correlated with differential trends in renters and younger owners. That is, it does not require parallel trends in all four groups, but in the differences among groups. For example, age-based exemptions may come to areas that are growing older, but if the correlation is similar for older renters and older owners, that correlation cancels out in the differencing. Furthermore, to address potential concerns of simultaneity between demographic trends and policy changes, we also repeat this approach using changes in population as a response to lagged policies.====In addition, we estimate the change in counties' mean housing values using a triple-difference strategy. The strategy is similar to the demographic model but ignores renters. Finally, we implement a more structural approach to estimate the effect of the policies on local populations. This model has stronger econometric assumptions but lends itself to more straightforward interpretations within an equilibrium model of locational choice.====We find a significant increase in older homeowners attributable to the combined effect of age-based property tax exemptions on location decisions and housing tenure. A ten percent increase in county households residing in a jurisdiction with age-based exemptions causes a 4–6% increase in the number of older homeowners, net of the change in untreated counties, relative to the change in older renters and younger households in treated counties. These estimates are generally stable over a range of specifications, including controls for the intensity of the exemption.====These reduced form estimates require relatively weak econometric assumptions. However, one may still be concerned about whether they identify an effect solely for older owners, or whether, by eroding the local tax base, there are effects on all demographic groups. In that case, we can still interpret the reduced form estimates as a causal effect, on demographic ====. For that reason, we view them qualitatively, as statistical evidence of an effect of the taxes on local demographic compositions. Then, to better interpret the results in an economic framework, we supplement these results by explicitly modeling substitution patterns with a structural model. There, we find both older and younger owners are attracted by the policy. We further find that exemptions induce increases in housing consumption by older households. Taken as a pair, the quadruple-difference and the locational choice model provides strong evidence that households are sorting on local tax variables. Finally, we find that in a counterfactual world where Cobb County (with Georgia's most generous exemptions for the elderly) had not enacted the policy, the population of older homeowners would be lower by an amount equal to 3–5% of the County's population.====Previous work on the sorting and migration of older households has focused on inter-state migration, which our work extends to the local (intra-state) sale. Conway and Rork (2006) examine interstate migration of older households and find little effect of state taxes on estates, inheritances, and gifts. Similarly, Conway and Rork (2012) find little effect of age-based income tax breaks. On the other hand, Moretti and Wilson (2020) find a large effect of state estate taxes on the location of billionaires, but only after the federal government eliminated its tax credit for state estate taxes. Önder and Schlunk (2019) find that older households are more likely to move to states that provide sales tax exemptions on items more frequently purchased by older households than young households. Gale and Heath (2000) explicitly model the endogeneity of elderly migration and state fiscal policy in their analysis and find that states with higher average property taxes have less net in-migration.====Several other papers have used Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) data on self-reported property tax payments when considering migration decisions. Seslen (2005) examines the effect of property taxes on the decision of older households to downsize and finds little evidence that property taxes influence the decision to move or liquidate their housing. Farnham and Sevak (2006) find that recent empty-nesters reduced their exposure to property taxes when moving across state lines, but not when moving within states, suggesting that households may consider this factor when making a move. Shan (2010) uses more recent data from the HRS and instruments for property tax payments with variation in state-provided property tax relief programs. She finds that higher property taxes do increase the housing mobility of older households, causing them to downsize or move to states with lower property taxes, with state-provided property tax relief programs diminishing that mobility.====In addition to the specific policy question of age-based tax exemptions, our results provide additional general evidence that households sort or vote based on tax burdens, conditional on amenities (Oates 1969, Palmon and Smith 1998, Banzhaf and Oates 2013, MacKay 2014, Stadelmann and Eichenberger 2014). Moulton, Waller, and Wentland (2018) have specifically found that age-based tax exemptions in Virginia increase property values, indicating an overall demand shock, but do not consider demographic sorting patterns or housing consumption explicitly.====The paper proceeds in the next section by outlining our empirical strategy. We detail the local property tax exemptions and describe the Georgia Property Tax Data Base in Section 3. Section 4 summarizes trends in the data and our main results.

The model highlights the role of public ==== accumulation in development. A community’s ,"Community development is an important topic in public and urban economics. In order for development to occur, it is necessary for housing to be built for new residents to live in and investments to be made in local public goods (schools, roads, public safety, parks, libraries, shopping and entertainment areas, etc) for their use. How this occurs and the distortions that arise in different institutional settings is a question of significant interest.====This paper presents and analyzes a novel political economy model of community development. It is a dynamic partial equilibrium model of a single community. The community starts out with a stock of housing and initial residents who own this housing. The community can grow by building new housing and new construction is supplied by competitive developers. There is a pool of potential residents with heterogeneous desires to live in the community, generating a downward sloping demand curve. There is turnover, with households entering and exiting the pool each period, so that the market for housing is always active. The possibility that current residents may leave the pool gives them an incentive to care about the value of their homes. The community provides a durable local public good, investment in which can be financed by debt or a uniform tax on all residents. Public investment and financing decisions are made in each period by the current residents and residents are fully forward-looking.====The main insight from the analysis concerns the potential role of public wealth accumulation in community development. The model’s structure implies that the community has public assets and liabilities in the form of a stock of public good and public debt. Ownership of these assets and liabilities is collective by the residents of the community. This collective ownership creates what is known as a ==== (see, for example, Henderson, 1988 p.166). Specifically, building an additional house in the community creates effectively a transfer (positive or negative) from the new resident to the existing residents. If the community’s wealth (i.e., the value of its public good stock less its debt) is positive, adding a new resident will reduce wealth per capita and the fiscal externality is negative. If wealth is negative, adding a new resident will increase wealth per capita and the fiscal externality will be positive. This externality is analogous to that arising in a common pool problem (although it can be positive) and will potentially distort the decisions of potential residents to build in the community.====Of course, the community’s wealth is endogenous and depends on its past fiscal decisions. These decisions shape the sign and strength of the externality and make it conceptually distinct from other fiscal externalities or common pool problems. When making fiscal decisions, forward-looking residents take into account their future impact on the externality. If the community has negative wealth, residents may want to increase it to benefit from the positive externality. For example, if they can attract more residents by reducing the community’s debt partially, this will spread the burden of the remaining debt over a larger group of residents. More importantly, even when the community has positive wealth, residents may want to further increase it to attract potential residents to benefit from a second fiscal externality - that created by new residents sharing the costs of public good provision.====To improve the community’s wealth requires residents to either tax-finance investment in the public good or raise taxes to pay down debt. In doing so, they are effectively subsidizing future residents. They will not always want to engage in this behavior, but, if they do, they create development for the community beyond the level that could be supported with its initial wealth. Moreover, if such development occurs, future residents may have an incentive to engage in more accumulation. This is because the cost of further accumulation can be spread over a larger group of residents. In this way, public wealth accumulation can fuel the gradual development of the community.====The paper’s formal analysis begins by finding an equilibrium of the model. The interaction described by the model gives rise to a dynamic game between the different cohorts of residents. Following the usual approach in dynamic political economy models, we look for a Markov equilibrium in which residents’ policy decisions and housing market outcomes just depend on the state variables - the public assets and housing stock. The novelty of the model makes finding an equilibrium a significant challenge. Our strategy is “guess and verify”. To develop intuition for what to guess, we characterize how development would proceed if residents, rather than just choose policies for one period, could commit future residents to following a complete development plan. These development plans are relatively simple and reveal the basic economics underlying the strategy of public wealth accumulation. We then consider whether future residents would choose to follow these plans. This sheds light on when the plans could describe equilibrium policies and, when they do not, how residents will need to modify the policies they control. We find that if the community’s wealth is below a critical level, future residents will want to deviate from earlier residents’ plans. They will desire additional public wealth accumulation because its cost is lower with a larger population. On the basis of this understanding of the incentives of the different cohorts of residents, we formulate a guess for an equilibrium and verify analytically that this is indeed an equilibrium. We then discuss existence, verifying by numerical methods that our equilibrium exists for a broad range of parameterizations of our model.====Once we have this equilibrium, we describe how the community develops for any initial conditions (i.e., initial public assets and housing stock). We then clarify the circumstances under which equilibrium involves community development by public wealth accumulation. This is defined as arising whenever the community grows beyond the size that could be supported by its initial wealth. We show that this occurs if and only if the community’s initial wealth falls below a critical level. We further show that this development comes in one of two forms. In the first, development begins in the initial period and the size of the community increases gradually and continually over time, converging asymptotically to a steady state level. In each period, the residents build the community’s wealth by financing some of the additional public good provided for the larger population with taxation. This accumulation paves the way for more development in the next period. The logic behind this gradual development is subtle because it is the off-equilibrium path behavior of future residents that provides incentives to current residents to engage in wealth accumulation. In the second form, there is no development in the first period and taxes are raised to build wealth. This accumulation allows development to begin in the next period. This development can either be gradual or rapid depending on the extent of accumulation in the initial period. Either way, the community converges to the same steady state.====Finally, we turn to the normative potential of community development by public wealth accumulation. We show that it does not allow the community to reach its efficient size. This reflects the fact that the future benefits of accumulation necessarily accrue partially to future residents via the fiscal externality. Thus current residents do not fully appropriate these benefits. These forces mean that accumulation will be under-supplied by residents. Nonetheless, the difference between the long run size of the community and the efficient size converges to zero as the probability of residents leaving the pool of potential residents converges to zero. We also show that, irrespective of the eventual size of the community, development by public wealth accumulation involves inefficient delay.====The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses related literature. Section 3 introduces the model and Section 4 establishes a normative benchmark by characterizing socially optimal development. Section 5 explains our strategy for finding equilibrium and describes the equilibrium that we uncover. Section 6 analyzes the conditions under which this equilibrium involves community development by public wealth accumulation and the nature of this development. Section 7 investigates how such development compares with optimal development and the reasons for the discrepancies. Section 8 discusses the empirical plausibility of development by wealth accumulation and identifies some other lessons from the analysis. Section 9 concludes with a brief summary and suggestions for future work.",Community development by public wealth accumulation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300681,19 November 2020,2020,Research Article,71.0
"Shen Lily,Ross Stephen","Clemson University,University of Connecticut","Received 8 November 2018, Revised 31 August 2020, Available online 18 November 2020, Version of Record 8 December 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2020.103299,Cited by (23),"This paper employs machine learning to quantify the value of “soft” information contained in real estate property descriptions. Textual descriptions contain information that traditional hedonic attributes cannot capture. A one ==== by between 10% to 23% and mistimes the stabilization of housing prices following the ====. Similar, but smaller effects, are observed for the repeat sales price index.","Real estate is a large and essential component of the U.S economy,==== and valuing real estate assets has always been challenging given the limited information available in traditional assessment and real estate databases. For example, while the number of bedrooms might be viewed as a “hard” attribute of a housing unit, the description of a housing unit may represent unreported “soft” features that capture information about the unit’s value (Liberti and Petersen, 2018). According to a 2018 Wall Street Journal article, institutional investors who buy and sell hundreds of houses on a daily basis utilize newly developed artificial intelligence technologies to extract “soft” information from unstructured real estate data.====Up to this point, academic studies on the use of “soft” information from property descriptions to value real estate have been primarily restricted to analyses of keywords, and those results have been mixed. On the one hand, Levitt and Syverson (2008), Rutherford et al. (2005), Liu et al. (2020), Shen and Wilkoff, (2020), and Lawani et al. (2018) find that the inclusion of indicator variables for positive/negative words and short phrases in real estate advertisements can reduce bias from omitted variables. On the other hand, Goodwin (2014) and Pryce (2008) point out that the effects of positive/negative words on real estate prices are not consistent across different word classes.====In this paper, we use a natural language processing algorithm to convert real estate property descriptions into numeric vectors of housing attributes. Unlike keyword approaches where the researcher creates a list of key words, these attribute vectors are created by a relatively unstructured, data driven process. We then use these quantitative measures for each description to assess the uniqueness of each property relative to its neighbors. Similarly, Ahlfeldt and Holman (2018) characterize neighborhood architectural quality based on distinctiveness, arguing that distinctiveness minimizes the influence of normative judgments and personal taste, unlike measures of quality or beauty. Our resulting measure of uniqueness is then included in both hedonic and repeat sales models of housing sales price. We examine both the impact of uniqueness on sales price and the effect of including controls for uniqueness on estimated price indexes.====To our knowledge, our study is the first paper to apply natural language processing to characterize the uniqueness of real estate properties and to apply such a measure of uniqueness to models of housing prices. Our paper is similar to Aubry et al. (2019) and Lindenthal (2017) who use machine learning techniques to characterize the attributes of artwork and real estate photos and then estimate hedonic models of the sales price. While we are the first to measure real estate uniqueness using textual data, Haurin (1988) and Haurin et al. (2010) model real estate “atypicality” using the observable, quantitative house features, and Ahlfeldt and Holman (2018) characterize neighborhood architectural distinctiveness using survey data.====The uniqueness of a property may influence prices through a few mechanisms. First, real estate agents use advertisements to emphasize positive features of a housing unit and are unlikely to mention negative aspects of the property in the description. As a result, our uniqueness measure likely captures the extent to which a housing unit has positive features that agents view as adding value. Even in a repeat sales model, housing quality may differ across transactions due to renovations or differences in maintenance (Harding et al., 2007).==== Second, in differentiated product markets, products that are unique in product attribute space have greater market power and so tend to sell for higher prices (Bayer et al., 2007 and Berry et al., 1995). Similarly, Haurin et al. (2010) shows that in a search model more “atypical” properties will have a greater variance of offers and a higher final sales price.==== Finally, in principle, some agents may be able to craft advertisements that are so unique and appealing that they influence the sales prices, perhaps by generating foot traffic, beyond the actual desirable attributes associated with the housing unit itself.====We analyze a data set that encompasses more than 40,000 single-family houses that were advertised and then sold in the metropolitan housing market of Atlanta, GA from 2010 to 2017. The analysis results suggest that houses with unique property descriptions are associated with higher sales prices than those units with less unique descriptions. Comparisons among houses located in geographical proximity and advertised in the same year show that a one standard deviation increase in description uniqueness leads to a 15% increase in the property sales price. Similarly, when comparing housing units that sold more than once, we find that a one standard deviation increase in uniqueness increases the sales price of the same unit by 10%. Even in the hedonic model, the information provided by the measure of uniqueness is, at most, weakly correlated with traditional hedonic attributes like square feet of living space or the number of bathrooms. On the other hand, the inclusion of uniqueness in the hedonic regressions reduces the importance of less well-defined hedonic variables like an indicator for whether a unit was newly renovated and an indicator for whether the house has special features. Further, our measure of uniqueness captures information that is independent of traditional controls for key words. Including advertisement keywords only reduces the impact of uniqueness on prices from 15% to just under 14% in the hedonic model and from 10% to 8% in the repeat sales model.====We estimate additional models to separate the price premium of uniqueness into two channels: the unobserved quality of the housing unit, and the influence of market power in a differentiated product market. Rather than calculating uniqueness by geographic area and year, we start with our sample of all transactions within a geographic area and then for each unique transaction we divide all other transactions in the same area between transactions that occur within six weeks before or after the transaction and those that occur outside of that window. The competing unit measure of uniqueness is intended to isolate the effects of market power, while eliminating competing units from the measure of uniqueness should tend to focus the measure more on unobserved attributes of the housing unit.====While the two new measures are highly correlated, the findings suggest that the effects of uniqueness in the hedonic model are due to both capturing unobserved attributes and market power, but the effects in the repeat sales model arise primarily from market power. The magnitude of the hedonic estimates on both measures are similar in magnitude to each other whether included independently or together in a horse race specification. In the repeat sales model, the horse race specification including both uniqueness measures yields significant estimates on uniqueness based on competing units and a near zero estimate based on non-competing units. The estimated effects of market power on housing price are comparable to effects of bargaining differentials on price estimated in Harding et al. (2003).====The third proposed mechanism was the possible role of agents in writing the advertisements and influencing the final sales price of the housing unit. The inclusion of agent fixed effects does erode the estimates by one and one-half percentage points in the hedonic model and by three percentage points in the repeat sales. However, while the ability of agent fixed effects to explain part of the uniqueness effect could be driven by real estate agent behavior, this ability also could arise because real estate agents differ in the type, quality and uniqueness of the housing units they represent. If the agents were truly influencing the sales price beyond the intrinsic value or market power of the housing unit, presumably these effects would be also reflected in the spread between the list price and the sales price (Haurin, Haurin, Nadauld, Sanders, 2010, Merlo, Ortalo-Magne, 2004), but we find no relationship between the list-sales price spread and uniqueness.====Finally, we use standard hedonic and repeat sales models to estimate price indexes (Silver, 2016 and Hill, 2013). We find changes in our transaction sample over time in terms of our uniqueness measure of almost 1/2 a standard deviation increase in uniqueness. This compositional change arises beginning in 2011, relatively early in the recovery from the Great Recession. The change in the composition of the housing stock biases the traditional hedonic price index post-2010 upwards by between 10% and 23%. We observe a similar, but smaller, upward bias in the repeat sales model of between 6% to 9%. Further, the biased price indexes suggest stabilization of the housing market in 2011, with prices falling by less than 6% in the hedonic model and flat in the repeat sales model. On the other hand, the index that is conditioned on uniqueness falls by 16% and 7% in 2011 based on the hedonic and repeat sales price indexes, suggesting that the housing market did not stabilize until 2012. These findings are consistent with the Lovo et al. (2014) model of art sales that predicts changes in the composition of sales over market cycles, which lead to bias in price indexes.====Our investigation indicates that textual property descriptions provide important information for quantitatively explaining housing prices. The uniqueness measure’s ability to explaining housing prices appears driven by two factors, housing attributes that are typically not captured in traditional property databases and the ability of the seller to extract surplus based on the housing unit’s uniqueness compared to other available housing. In the case of repeat sales models, the importance of uniqueness appears to arise almost entirely due to market power. These findings on market power provide unique evidence that housing markets are relatively non-competitive operating as differentiated product markets, as in Bayer et al. (2007) and Wong (2013), and that not accounting for market power may lead to errors in estimated price indexes. The market power findings also complement the literature on bargaining in housing markets (Han, Strange, 2015, Harding, Rosenthal, Sirmans, 2003, and Merlo and Ortalo-Magne, 2004).",Information value of property description: A Machine learning approach,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009411902030070X,18 November 2020,2020,Research Article,72.0

Using rich geo-coded Swedish data, we account for possible ==== by combining policy-induced initial immigrant settlements with exogenous contemporaneous immigration as captured by refugee shocks. We find the same flight among all natives, irrespective of their parental foreign background. This suggests that “ethnic distance” to the new immigrants is not the dominant channel causing natives’ flight behavior. Instead, refugee immigration seems to lead to more socio-economically segregated neighborhoods.","Over the last decades, many European and other Western countries have witnessed increased immigration, with a drastic culmination in 2015. In this year alone, UNHCR estimated that around 1 million individuals reached the shores of Europe after having crossed the Mediterranean. In the wake of this experience, heated discussions have emerged on how and where to accommodate all these refugees. In particular, a major political concern is the emergence of ethnically segregated neighborhoods. Aside from immigrants tending to one another, such a development is reinforced if the native population reacts by leaving or avoiding neighborhoods that become more ethnically diverse. The extent to which natives do so is the topic of this paper.====We study the migration behavior of the native population—here, native Swedes—when new immigrants arrive. We hypothesize that this may be manifested either in the form of ==== (immigration inducing natives to move out of a neighborhood) or in the form of ==== (immigration inducing natives to avoid moving into a neighborhood where more immigrants tend to settle). Ultimately, the aim is to use estimated migration responses to deduce whether natives prefer ==== homogeneous neighborhoods. We approach this task by developing the so-called “shift-share” method into a much-improved identification strategy.====In order to create effective policies to combat segregation, it is important to know both ==== natives change their behavior following immigration and, if so, ==== they do so. The common hypothesis in the literature on “white flight” is that migration responses are due to preferences for ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods (see, for instance, Saiz, 2007, Boustan, 2010, Saiz, Wachter, 2011, Sá, 2015). However, newly arrived immigrants exhibit a number of different characteristics other than their ethnicity. For example, the average refugee typically has a lower level of education and income than the native population. Which trait do the natives actually react to? Do they react to the ethnicity of the immigrants, as typically hypothesized in the earlier literature, or their socio-economic composition?====We reach three main conclusions. First, we do not find any evidence of either native flight or native avoidance when studying the entire population.====Second, we find it important to acknowledge that, due to various constraints, far from all individuals are able to react based on their residential preferences. To that end, we want to distinguish between households with a high/low ability to move to a preferred neighborhood following an increase in immigration. In our setting, we define mobile actors as homeowners rather than renters, as the rental market in Sweden is characterized by long (sometimes extreme) queues, and renters frequently compete over the same apartments as the newly arrived refugees.====A key result is that, when studying the group of natives identified as having a high ability to move to a preferred neighborhood, we estimate significant flight responses. We further find that the flight in this group goes to neighborhoods ==== rather than ==== municipalities.==== In contrast, there are no effects of increased immigration on the migration behavior among natives identified as having a low ability to move to a preferred neighborhood. The pronounced flight effect in the sub-sample of mobile natives is in accordance with assumptions made in theoretical models on the effects of immigration on native migration. However, it is a previously neglected aspect in empirical work, which means that our results potentially have implications for the interpretations made in existing, related studies that have only looked at aggregate (average) effects.====Third, we conclude that a preference for ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods is not the dominant channel causing flight. Instead, our analyses consistently indicate that natives have preferences for socio-economically homogeneous (or “better”) neighborhoods.==== In particular, we find that the flight effect is the same across different groups of natives with different parental foreign backgrounds. This, in turn, suggests that the “ethnic distance” to the new immigrants is not the dominant channel causing natives’ flight behavior.====The paper brings several value-adding features to the literature on native flight and avoidance. Thanks to comprehensive, detailed register data, a contribution of the paper is to examine the validity of the presumed ethnicity channel in a way that earlier literature was unable to do. Our data allows us to identify natives with different parental foreign backgrounds. And since many native-born individuals with non-Western parents are ethnically quite similar to current immigrants (in terms of country of origin), yet in many cases socio-economically more similar to native-born individuals with Swedish-born parents, we can use the parental information to explore the validity of the ethnicity channel. Consequently, we are able to examine whether there is support for the hypothesis that residential preferences are formed along an ethnic dimension by estimating the migration response of natives conditioned on their parents’ country of birth.====The geographic level of detail of our data allows us to examine where those who move following increased immigration go. Do they move to neighborhoods within their municipality (short-distance moves) or do they move to another municipality (long-distance moves)? Our finding that these moves mainly occur between neighborhoods within a municipality points to the importance of having fine-grained geographic data when examining native flight, which is very rare in the previous literature. Consequently, papers only having studied out-migration from large geographical areas, such as municipalities or metropolitan areas, might have underestimated the flight effect of increased immigration.====This paper also contains several methodological improvements. Our data contains information on each individual immigrant’s reason for applying for a residence permit—whether or not he or she arrived as a refugee, tied family migrant, or labor migrant. This is a unique feature enabling us to make a distinct methodological improvement to related studies. In particular, we focus on refugees. Not only is this a highly topical and interesting group to study, but from a methodological point of view, refugee migration is arguably more exogenous to the characteristics of the receiving city or neighborhood, as compared to labor, student or family migration.====To see how the focus on refugee migration constitutes a methodological improvement, note that much of the previous literature on white flight has focused on the US==== and has frequently categorized all immigration as one common treatment. Besides the fact that generalizing all immigration into one concept implies that nuanced mechanisms may be lost, it may also cause endogeneity problems. A large proportion of immigrants to the US are ==== to specific places====, whereas refugees tend to have been ==== from their native country by wars and other catastrophes.==== Hence, increases in US-type immigration could to a larger extent than the refugee immigration we focus on be a function of regional chocks and pull factors, which affect both immigrants but potentially also the behavior of natives.====We identify the causal effect of foreign immigration on the residential choice of natives by combining (i) contemporary refugee migration to Sweden with (ii) previous immigrant settlement patterns resulting from a refugee placement policy that was in place in the early years of our study period. In short, the policy meant that refugees were not allowed to decide for themselves where to settle but were assigned a municipality by the Migration Board. We argue that this policy-generated settlement is yet another methodological improvement to existing studies. The rationale for this is that immigrant settlement patterns from the early 1990s, which subsequently attracted more recent push-driven refugee migrants, are more likely to be uncorrelated with neighborhood characteristics that matter for natives’ residential preferences compared to settlement patterns in the absence of such a policy.====Our panel data also allows us to incorporate neighborhood-fixed effects. Ultimately, we construct an instrumental variable for ==== in immigration based on the interaction of, on the one side, immigrant settlements during the placement policy era and, on the other, the timing of contemporary, refugee-driven immigrant shocks. Arguably, this results in an improvement of the typical shift-share instrument used previously in the literature, where both initial immigrant settlement as well as contemporary immigration are added directly to the analysis and are thus likely to be endogenous to the outcome (see, for instance, Altonji, Card, 1991, Card, DiNardo, 2000, Saiz, 2007, Basten, Siegenthaler, 2013, Chalfin, Levy, Sá, 2015).====The data used in this paper originates from the GeoSweden database, covering the entire Swedish population since 1990. Several of the value-adding features and important sets of results (as laid out above) are only made possible thanks to the detailed information in this database. In particular, we are able to, on a year-to-year basis, identify immigrants granted a residence permit in Sweden based on refugee status, as well as natives who rent or own their homes. Furthermore, for each immigrant living in Sweden, there is information on his or her country of origin. Finally, all variables are presented as an annual panel covering relatively small neighborhoods. While the panel structure enables the fixed effects mentioned above, the high geographical resolution means that we can capture more nuanced residential preferences, as we are able to observe relatively short moves that are likely less costly than moving between larger units, such as metropolitan areas.====Apart from the literature ==== estimating the extent to which the residential choices of natives are affected by immigration,==== our paper is related to an influential set of literature having ==== studied the response of natives to increased immigration by estimating effects on house prices (Saiz, 2007, Saiz, Wachter, 2011, Sá, 2015, Accetturo, Manaresi, Mocetti, Olivieri, 2014, Balkan, Tok, Torun, Tumen, 2018, Braakmann, 2019) and wages (Card, 1990, Altonji, Card, 1991).====This paper is also closely linked to the so-called tipping point literature estimating at which potential proportion of immigrants in a neighborhood or a city the native population disproportionately starts to leave (Schelling, 1971, Card, Mas, Rothstein, 2008, Aldén, Hammarstedt, Neuman, 2015). We instead focus on continuous native migration. Finally, complementing the studies of the effects ==== residential segregation (Edin et al., 2003), our focus is on the effects of immigration ==== residential segregation.====In the next section, we describe recent immigration patterns to Sweden. Section 3 then discusses the theoretical mechanisms through which we hypothesize that these patterns affect natives’ migration responses and, in particular, describes our idea for examining whether there is any support for the ethnicity-based mechanism. While Section 4 lays out the strategy used to estimate these responses empirically, Section 5 presents the data used to obtain the main results, which are provided in Section 6.

Provincial leaders who choose the location of such parks have political career incentives to select sites that increase ==== growth, but also to select sites that reward city officials with whom they have connections. By exploiting plausibly exogenous changes in political connections, we document that city officials with connections to key provincial decision-makers are more likely to win parks. We estimate the heterogeneous urban growth effects of attracting such place-based investments. We find that industrial park sites chosen largely as a result of favorable political connections generate lower economic benefits than those chosen largely based on their economic fundamentals.","Over the course of nearly four decades, the Chinese central government has created more than 1,400 industrial parks, which play a central role in the economic fortunes of the country and the local host cities.==== Although these parks occupy just 0.1% of China's total land area, they contain 40% of the nation's manufacturing jobs, and contribute 10% of China's GDP and 33% of its foreign direct investment (Lu et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2017). Each park is a multi-billion-dollar investment that involves securing a large parcel of land, upgrading related infrastructure, constructing buildings, and offering economic incentives (subsidies, tax reductions) to attract firms and stimulate local agglomeration economies (Wang, 2013).====The literature suggests that such place-based investments can stimulate significant urban economic growth through agglomeration economies and human capital spillovers (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2008). Recent empirical research indicates that the average park is associated with varying levels of economic growth in China (Wang, 2013). Alder et al. (2016) find a 20% increase in the local GDP 10 years after the opening of a nation-level park; Lu et al. (2019) find that after two years, areas with industrial parks (special economic zones) have 47.1% greater employment and 55.3% larger output than areas that do not have such parks. These average effects mask significant heterogeneity in returns (Kline, 2010). Beijing's Zhongguancun Science Park and the Shenzhen High Tech Industrial Park are prominent examples of successes, but other parks have fizzled, becoming industrial “ghost towns.” For example, Zheng et al. (2017) show that 30% of parks built in eight major Chinese cities failed to generate local agglomeration benefits. Certain parks – those farther from the central city, and those with more state-owned enterprises or lower levels of human capital – generate lower agglomeration spillovers (Zheng et al., 2017).====The fact that similar place-based capital investments generate very different returns raises questions about the decision-making processes that underpin the site selection. Provincial leaders in China determine the sites of national- and provincial-level parks by choosing among the cities in the province, which compete to become industrial park hosts.==== Provincial leaders who seek to rise in the Chinese Communist Party have an incentive to invest in projects that contribute to economic growth (Li and Zhou, 2005); at the same time, they also have an incentive to build a network of loyal followers to reduce the likelihood of being ousted from power (e.g., Dittmer, 1995). Steering scarce resources, such as place-based investments, in the direction of their allies is a common strategy to maintain loyalty within these networks.==== Whether investing in the city of an ally helps a provincial leader to achieve the best economic outcomes is an empirical question. On the one hand, if political connections distort the site selection away from alternative sites with better economic fundamentals, political favoritism would be associated with the misallocation of capital and lower levels of economic benefits.==== On the other hand, complementarities may surface between political connections and park investment decision because connected city leaders may be able to attract greater levels of resources that enhance a park's productivity (Bai et al., 2014; Baum-Snow et al., 2017).====This paper builds on studies documenting the importance of political connections in determining economic outcomes in Indonesia (Fishman, 2001) and China (Jia et al., 2015) by studying the empirical determinants and economic repercussions of public investment decision-making on industrial parks in China. We present two main findings. First, we show that provincial leaders are more likely to place a park in cities led by someone connected to the provincial leader. Second, we find that those industrial parks chosen largely on the strength of political patronage generate lower levels of local urban growth compared to those parks selected largely on the basis of economic and geographic fundamentals. We find that a park in a politically connected city generates 5.2% lower GDP per capita (or 4.8% lower TFP) than its counterpart.====We test for the role that political connections play in this government capital allocation decision by creating a detailed social networks database to track the long-term connections between China's provincial leaders and city leaders at different points in time. Using hand-collected information on curricula vitae of officials, we construct a uniquely large dataset of city- and provincial-level leaders who held office from 1987 to 2008. Following the approach of Jia et al. (2015), we measure political connections between top city-level officials and the corresponding, key province-level leaders based on workplace, education, birthplace, and political faction. We assume that upper-level government leaders are likely to favor subordinates with whom they share early an experience in a workplace, or with whom they share other personal or political ties.====A central issue in our empirical analysis is to address the potential endogeneity concern that provincial leaders do not randomly assign mayors to cities. They may make decisions based on two criteria: “better skills” or “better cities.” City officials with better skills are more likely to be better connected to higher-level politicians – leading, in turn, to a greater likelihood of winning a park. City officials with better connections may be more likely to gain leadership positions in better or improving cities whose features may, in turn, make them more likely park destinations. To address these challenges, we use detailed data on the tenure of leaders, and identify political connection exogenously generated by political rotations at higher levels of government.==== The turnover of key provincial leaders induced by the five-year (or shorter) political cycle of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) provides exogenous shocks to the political connections between incumbent city leaders with their upper-level bosses.==== We use this source of variation to estimate regressions for both site selections and economic growth outcomes.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background and context regarding China's investment in industrial parks, and discusses related literatures regarding the effect of industrial parks on economic growth. Section 3 presents data and measures of political connections. Section 4 presents the evidence on the impacts of political connections on the placement of industrial parks. Section 5 evaluates how political connections affect the role of industrial parks in local economic growth. Section 6 concludes.","Do political connections help or hinder urban economic growth?

This is not the case for the rest of Indonesia, for which we, moreover, find a much lower estimated agglomeration wage premium. We provide an explanation for these findings, and also tentatively probe the factors behind Indonesia's agglomeration wage premium.","Traditionally, urban economists have relied on data for cities as defined by their administrative boundaries or, where available, by their official metropolitan boundaries. However, administrative boundaries often fail to adequately delineate a city's extent. This is especially the case in situations where urbanization has been rapid and/or many cities have been sprawling in land area, leading them to spill-over, increasingly inaccurate, administrative boundaries (see, for example, Ellis and Roberts, 2016). Similarly, official metropolitan boundaries, while seemingly preferable to administrative boundaries, may be subject to biases owing to political pressures in their definition, aided by a lack of transparency in the algorithms used in their construction and the use of a multiplicity of ==== imposed criteria (Duranton, 2015a).====In reaction to this, there has been a recent growth in efforts to develop and apply algorithms that enable the better delineation of cities and metropolitan areas. These efforts have been led not just by economists (see, for example, Rozenfeld et al., 2011; Duranton, 2015a; Baragwanath et al., 2020; de Bellefon et al., 2020; Dingel et al., 2020; Henderson et al., 2020; Galdo et al., 2020), but also by both geographers and the remote sensing community, in which there is a long tradition of using satellite imagery to define a city's extent (see, for example, Danko, 1992; Elvidge et al., 1996). Moreover, while academic economists have largely confined themselves to attempting to better delineate cities and metropolitan areas for individual countries or small groups of countries, international organizations such as the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), the European Commission (EC), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank have sought to develop and apply algorithms at regional and global scales (see, respectively, Ch et al., 2020; Dijkstra et al., 2019; Moreno-Monroy et al., 2020; World Bank, 2009). The ambition of these organizations has been to construct consistently defined regional and global data sets of cities or metropolitan areas to facilitate the uniform measurement of urbanization.====The preferred approach of economists to defining cities and metropolitan areas tends to be rooted in a labor market perspective based on commuting flow data, as with the definition of “statistical” metropolitan areas in the United States, France or Japan. This preference is consistent with the labor market pooling that occurs within cities being viewed (ever since Marshall, 1890) as one of the key sources of agglomeration economies. Also, the flow of workers is easier to track than either the flow of intermediate goods between firms or the flow of ideas (forward-backward linkages and knowledge spillovers being the other two prominent sources of agglomeration economies). Commuting patterns furthermore tend to occur over distances that people naturally recognize as metropolitan (Duranton, 2015a).====Commuting flow data, however, is hard to come by for many, especially developing, countries. Attempts to better delineate cities and metropolitan areas in such countries or to define regionally or globally consistent data sets of cities, therefore, instead rely on alternative approaches based on more readily available data. This includes the use of estimated travel times to approximate commuting sheds (Uchida and Nelson, 2009; World Bank, 2009; Ellis and Roberts, 2016; Moreno-Monroy et al., 2020) and approaches that associate cities with dense clusters of population (Dijkstra and Poelman, 2014; Dijkstra et al., 2019; Roberts, 2018a; Henderson et al., 2020). It also includes approaches that take advantage of satellite imagery to identify cities based on the amount of light they emit at night or their built-up area (Ellis and Roberts, 2016; Baragwanath et al., 2020; Dingel et al., 2020; Ch et al., 2020). Finally, there are approaches that apply algorithms to detailed maps, with precise locational information, of all buildings within a country to identify cities (Arribas-Bel et al., 2020; de Bellefon et al., 2020).====While, however, much effort has gone into developing and applying these, mainly morphological, approaches for the better delineation of cities and metro areas, only limited efforts have been made to compare the metropolitan area landscapes that they generate in terms of, for example, the number and sizes of metro areas identified. Also, little is known about how their use compares to an explicit commuting-based approach.==== This lack of comparison is particularly interesting because, unlike a commuting based approach, the alternative approaches do not make use of any, or only limited, explicit information on actual flows of people, goods or ideas across space.====Given the above, the main aims of this paper are two-fold. First, we compare the results of different approaches for delineating metropolitan areas in terms of the basic descriptions they provide of the metro area landscape (notably, the number of metro areas, their size, the sub-national administrative units they consist of, and the shares of the urban population that they cover). Second, we explore whether, and if so how, key empirical results that are crucial to a proper understanding of the working of urban economies depend on the approach used to delineate these metropolitan areas. In particular, we show that the estimated agglomeration wage premium is sensitive to the choice of delineation approach.====More specifically, we compare four different approaches. The first is based on an algorithm developed by Duranton (2015a) and requires origin-destination (O-D) ====. The other three approaches are all non-commuting data approaches: the ==== (AI), which was first developed by Uchida and Nelson (2009) for the World Bank's 2009 World Development Report (World Bank, 2009); a “====” developed by Dijkstra and Poelman (2014) which associates cities with dense clusters of population and which forms the basis of the “degree of urbanization” approach that is discussed by Dijkstra et al. (2019); and, finally, the identification and delineation of metro areas based on the thresholding of ==== data (NTL), similar to, for example, Ellis and Roberts (2016) and Dingel et al. (2020). The latter three approaches all have the advantage that they can be applied to any country in the world using readily available data sets, including those countries for which O-D commuting flow data is not available.====In all our empirics, we focus on the case of a single, large, developing country – Indonesia. We choose Indonesia for two main reasons. First, Indonesia's national labor force survey (====, SAKERNAS) allows for the derivation of an O-D matrix of commuting flows between districts. As such, Indonesia is one of only a very few developing countries for which we can compare results obtained using a commuting data-based approach to the delineation of metropolitan areas to results from other approaches. Second, Indonesia, and especially its island-region of Java-Bali, provides a perfect example of a rapidly urbanizing developing country in which many cities have been expanding quickly in area, leading them to spill-over their administrative boundaries. This makes the choice of approach to delineating metropolitan areas that potentially straddle administrative boundaries particularly salient. In fact, there is a growing recognition among Indonesia's policymakers of the need for an appropriate algorithm to be able to identify “multi-district” cities or metropolitan areas (see, Roberts et al., 2019).====Of course, our focus on Indonesia raises the natural question of the extent to which our results may be taken as being of relevance to other countries. After all, Indonesia is an archipelago country consisting of more than 17,000 islands. Furthermore, a large share of its cities are coastal cities: 55% of its cities with a population of at least 300,000 lie within 15 km of a coastline.==== However, while, ====, this may seem to bring into question the external validity of our exercise, it is important to remember that the bulk of Indonesia's urban, and, indeed, overall, population is concentrated on just four main island-regions. Java-Bali, Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi together accounted for 95.9% of Indonesia's overall urban population in 2016 with Java-Bali alone accounting for 68.9% (Roberts et al., 2019). Moreover, while it is true that a large share of its cities are coastal cities, Indonesia is by no means unique in this respect. For example, the share of cities with a population of 300,000 or more in the United Kingdom that are within 15 km of a coast (56%) is almost identical to the share for Indonesia. Meanwhile, the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia and Australia all have larger shares of their cities located within 15 km of a coast than does Indonesia.====In fact, from an external validity perspective, Indonesia's geography can be argued to be an advantage. In particular, its main island groupings exhibit very different population densities, each of which can be taken as representative of different parts of the developing world. A clear distinction can be drawn between Java-Bali and the rest of Indonesia in this regard. At 1093 people per km====, Java-Bali had an average population density in 2016 close to that of Bangladesh, the Northeastern states of India, and the Nile delta. Meanwhile, outside of Java-Bali, no island-region had an average population density greater than 155 people per km==== in 2016, which, according to data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database, is close to the average population density of all lower middle-income countries globally. In our analysis, we thus breakdown results between Java-Bali and the rest of Indonesia. This allows us to investigate the behavior and the comparability of the different approaches in different population density settings.====By focusing on Indonesia, our paper also contributes to the emerging, but still relatively small, literature that provides credible empirical evidence on the strength of agglomeration economies in developing countries (Combes et al., 2015; Duranton, 2016; Chauvin et al., 2017; Combes et al., 2019; Quintero and Roberts, 2018; Roberts, 2018b; Henderson et al., 2020). This is a knowledge gap that Overman and Venables (2005), Duranton (2015b), and Glaeser and Henderson (2017) have all made calls for the profession to fill.====Finally, in examining how different approaches to metro area delineation affect the estimated agglomeration wage premium, our paper complements Briant et al. (2010) and Holmes and Lee (2010). Using French and US data respectively, these papers analyze how the size and shape of the spatial units used affects, ====, the measured degree of spatial concentration, the evidence on Zipf's Law, and the estimated agglomeration wage premium. What we add to these papers is a specific focus on the effects of the choice between different approaches to defining metropolitan areas, as well as of the choice of threshold(s) associated with any given approach, on the estimation of the agglomeration wage premium. Moreover, and consistent with the most recent empirical studies on the agglomeration wage premium (see Duranton, 2016; Chauvin et al., 2017; De La Roca and Puga, 2017), we analyze the effects of the choice of approach in a regression context where the outcome variable, a worker's nominal wage, is observed at the individual level. In this setting, differences in the delineation of metropolitan areas arising from the choice of approach lead to different allocations of workers across metropolitan areas, as well as between metro and non-metro urban areas. This, in turn, leads to differences in the measured level of density for these individual workers. It also leads to differences in the measurement of density for workers who are assigned to the same metro area by different approaches, but for which the approaches lead to the drawing of different boundaries for those metro areas.====We find that the description of Indonesia's metropolitan area landscape produced can be very different depending on the approach and thresholds used to delineate metro areas. This is particularly so when comparing the metro areas defined by the commuting based approach with those defined by the other three approaches that we consider. On top of this, the estimated size of the agglomeration wage premium tends to fall when using a stricter approach and threshold(s) to delineate metro areas. This is, however, only the case on Java-Bali, where urbanization has been comparatively rapid with many fast-expanding cities spilling over administrative boundaries. In the rest of Indonesia, where urbanization is much less advanced and most urban areas remain well-confined within administrative districts, the agglomeration wage premium is almost invariant to the choice of approach and threshold used to delineate metro areas, as well as several orders of magnitude smaller than on Java-Bali. We provide explanations for these findings and, moreover, probe the possible factors behind Indonesia's agglomeration wage premium.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the four approaches for delineating metropolitan areas that we compare. Section 3 discusses the data that we use to apply these approaches to Indonesia. Section 4 provides a descriptive comparison of Indonesia's metropolitan area landscape under the different approaches. Section 5 presents our estimates of the agglomeration wage premium using the different approaches to defining metro areas. Section 6 provides a tentative empirical exploration of the sources of Indonesia's agglomeration economies. Section 7 concludes.",Definition matters.

In fact, for many social scientists urbanization is the hallmark of economic development. For example, in the absence of historical information on per capita income, several authors have used historical urbanization rates as a proxy of economic prosperity.==== This implies that cities, as nuclei of the urbanization process, are the main drivers of economic growth.====But what is a city? Conceptually, cities -or metropolitan areas-==== are the spatial integration of social and economic activity, and the higher the geographical concentration of households and firms, the greater the potential economic benefits net of congestion costs (Combes et al., 2019, Duranton and Puga, 2014, Rosenthal, Strange, 2004). However, in spite of our relatively consensual theoretical understanding of cities, its empirical measurement has proven more challenging. Empirical definitions usually rely on administrative borders, which do not necessarily correspond by the physical space where interactions between economic and social agents occur. This implies that stylized facts about patterns of urbanization across countries are likely to be biased because of measurement error (Roberts et al., 2016), which may partly explain, for instance, why the available cross-country estimates of the Zipf’s law are not robust.==== As put by Duranton and Puga (2014) “The empirical validity of Zipf’s -law is hotly debated” (p.833), and the cross-country evidence (Rosen and Resnick, 1980, Soo, 2005) has been interpreted both for and against the Zipf’s law. Chauvin et al. (2017), for example, test the existence of the law in Brazil, China, India and the U.S., using respectively micro-regions, cities, districts and metropolitan areas. These are heterogeneous measures whose comparison the authors recognize as “debatable” (p.20).====In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to translate the concept of city into a standard measurement of the size of a metropolitan area that is independent of country-specific administrative criteria of city limits, allowing for global comparisons. Specifically, following recent remote sensing and economic development literature -reviewed by Donaldson and Storeygard (2016)-, our measure leverages on the availability of satellite images of night lights.====We adopt two main steps: first, nighttime light data are cleaned and processed; second, processed lit pixels are classified to identify the extension of cities. The first step recognizes that nighttime light data suffers from several sources of measurement error, which we correct by combining insights from a large body of literature on remote sensing (Abrahams et al., 2018, Elvidge, Baugh, Tilottama, Zhizhin, 2009, Imhoff et al., 1997, Liu et al., 2012).==== Importantly, we do not claim any improvement on the remote sensing methodological literature. Rather, we provide a systematic and replicable algorithm on how to correct several sources of potential bias for the specific purpose of classifying lit pixels as urban areas.====The second step classifies metropolitan areas as spatial conglomerates of 1 km==== nighttime ==== pixels built around a pre-identified urban core. An important challenge is that some lit pixels are unstable. That is, they are detected by the satellite in only a fraction of the daily pictures. Clearly, imposing a stability threshold (that is, requiring pixels to be lit in a minimum fraction of the satellite images) affects the estimation of the size of metropolitan areas. Since we do not hold a strong prior about the minimum pixel stability, the paper presents estimations using various thresholds.====As a result, we end up with a world-wide geo-referenced dataset of the location and area of a maximum of 6,635 (7,660) metropolitan areas of at least 50,000 inhabitants in 2000 (2010). The actual number of cities changes by varying the pixel stability threshold, as well as the threshold of the width of the urban corridor used to split very large metropolitan areas into underlying cities.==== We produce a total of 15 different estimates of cities by varying these thresholds. Table 1 reports the minimum and maximum estimated number of cities for the entire world as well as each one of the seven world regions identified by the World Bank, both for 2000 and for 2010. Based on the Spanish acronym of this Metropolitan Areas Extension Database (====), we call our resulting data BEAM.====Our globally comparable dataset can be further overlaid with existing geo-referenced population data in order to estimate urban population (and thus urbanization rates) and population growth, as well as compute city-wide densities. In fact, we compare the distribution of urban area, urban population and population density across world regions and document several robust stylized facts. In particular, while the distribution of urban population in cities larger than 50,000 people is relatively similar across regions, regardless of their level of development, average urban area is larger in developed countries, especially North America. This implies that population density is higher in developing countries. We also compute urbanization rates for the entire world -conditional on cities having at least 50,000 inhabitants- and study the cross-country association between urbanization rates and income levels. We find that the correlation is positive in each cross section, but not when we exploit the panel structure of BEAM and control for country and time fixed effects. In this case the correlation either disappears or may even become negative. This may well be explained by the specific sample period, which covers a decade of low global growth rates (2000 to 2010).====In addition to providing details about the computation of BEAM and describing these basic stylized facts, we illustrate the advantages of this measure studying the size distribution of cities in the entire world and compare our results to recent evidence provided by Chauvin et al. (2017) for selected developed and developing countries. For instance, when we test Zipf’s law using BEAM, our estimates of the rank size rule are smaller than those of Chauvin et al. (2017) -with the exception of China- and smaller than what it is predicted by Zipf’s law. This implies that, in three out of the four countries analyzed by these authors, the largest cities are larger than what Zipf’s law would predict.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses several measures used in the literature to estimate the size of metropolitan areas, and describes the methodology, including data problems, the data cleaning procedure and the classification of lit pixels into urban conglomerates. It also includes a brief description of how population counts can be used as an ex-post estimation procedure. Section 3 compares BEAM with existing datasets and summarizes world and region-level stylized facts regarding the number of cities, the distribution of city areas, population density and urbanization rates, including a discussion about the relationship between urbanization and income per capita.

For a representative sample of cities, towns and villages, as administratively defined, we rely on human judgment of Google images to determine whether they are urban or rural in practice. We collect judgments across four groups of assessors, differing in their familiarity with India and with urban issues, following two different protocols. We then combine the judgment-based classification with data from the population census and from satellite imagery to predict the urban status of the sample. The Logit model, and LASSO and random forests methods, are applied. These approaches are then used to decide whether each of the out-of-sample administrative units in India is urban or rural in practice. We do not find that India is substantially more urban than officially claimed. However, there are important differences at more disaggregated levels, with “other towns” and “census towns” being more rural, and some southern states more urban, than is officially claimed. The consistency of human judgment across assessors and protocols, the easy availability of crowd-sourcing, and the stability of predictions across approaches, suggest that the proposed methodology is a promising avenue for studying urban issues.","What is a city? The most candid answer may be “I know one when I see it.” The subjectivity of the city concept is understandable because of the continuum between urban and rural spaces. The many terms used to describe this in-between—suburb, exurb, edge city, and urban fringe, among others—testifies to the absence of a clear divide. Even allegedly urban localities can differ substantially in their key attributes, as they range from compact cities to sprawling low-density areas. In this context, just like beauty, a city is in the eyes of the beholder.====The rural-urban continuum and the heterogeneity of urban settings pose an obvious challenge to identifying urban areas and measuring urbanization rates in a consistent way within and across countries. An objective methodology for distinguishing between urban and rural areas that is based on one or two metrics with fixed thresholds may not adequately capture the wide diversity of places. A richer combination of criteria would better describe the multifaceted nature of a city's function and its environment, but the joint interpretation of these criteria may require an element of human judgment.====In this paper we turn this unavoidable subjectivity into an opportunity, by proposing a methodology to identify urban areas that combines human judgment with machine learning. Human judgment is used to classify a representative sample of places into urban or rural. Reliance on several, qualitatively different groups of assessors, as well as on different classification protocols, provides reassurance that the outcome is stable. This sample is in turn used as the training set for a machine learning exercise allowing to classify out-of-sample places as urban or rural. A comparison between the various classification approaches provides further reassurance that the prediction outcome is robust.====We illustrate the potential of this methodology by applying it to India. Two reasons motivate this choice. First is scale: accounting for almost a fifth of the world population, India encompasses states with incomes per capita comparable to Mexico and others similar to Benin. Second is the “messiness” of its urbanization process, characterized by a wide variation in the strength of local urban authorities, from high in state capitals to dismal in other cities. Scale and messiness result in an enormous diversity of places, ranging from a glamorous metropolis such as Mumbai, capital of Maharashtra, to a shabby town such as Bagula in West Bengal, to any among hundreds of thousands of villages.====With such wide spatial diversity, not surprisingly there is considerable debate as to how urbanized India actually is. The official urbanization rate for 2011 is 31.2 percent. Several studies using alternative population thresholds or satellite imageries of built-up cover have argued that many areas of India are misclassified as rural by the administrative definition. Depending on the methodology, the urbanization rates estimated by these studies range from 42.0 to 78.0 percent (Denis and Marius-Gnanou 2011; Dijkstra et al., 2018; Ministry of Finance 2017).====Conversely, a study in this special issue relies on a range of parameters to delineate urban markets and suggests that India could be even less urbanized than the official figures imply. In this other study the urbanization rate ranges from 14.8 to 33.5 percent when using nighttime light data, and from 27.1 to 39.4 percent when using built-up cover data (Baragwanath et al., 2019). Shedding light on this debate is the second motivation for choosing India to illustrate our proposed methodology.====Subjective assessments are increasingly being used to complement more objective approaches across various fields in economics. For example, good-looking ratings by independent parties have been shown to be correlated with occupational sorting, earnings differentials and physical performance (Beller et al., 1994; Hamermesh and Biddle 1994; Postma 2014). Similarly, self-reported happiness has been adopted as a wellbeing indicator on the grounds that everybody has his or her own views on what a good life looks like, and what makes a good life may touch on dimensions for which no reliable indicator is available (Frey and Stutzer 2002; Veenhoven 2004).====In the urban economics literature, crowd-sourced assessments of street-level images have been used to determine how safe a neighborhood feels, how clean it looks, or how lively it seems. These are aspects of cities that standard measures, such as income levels, are unable to fully capture (Salesses et al., 2013). Further, this literature has applied machine learning to extend the assessment to other cities, not covered by the original crowd-sourcing (Naik et al., 2016). Machine learning has also been used to predict a neighborhood's socioeconomic characteristics out of its appearance (Glaeser et al., 2018; Naik et al., 2015).====Human judgment is also behind imagery interpretation in the remote sensing literature. Machine learning is often used in this literature to classify billions of “cells” of satellite imageries, for example in terms of their land use. However, satellite imageries are difficult to interpret, because they are two-dimensional, taken directly from above and generally lacking recognizable details. Therefore, an important step is to generate subjective assessments for a subset of cells that is then used as either a training sample or validation data for the machine learning exercise (Campbell and Wynne 2011).====Building on these precedents, our methodology applies subjective assessments to open-source images generated by Google for a representative sample of places in India. We overlay these images with the digitized boundaries of Indian cities, towns and villages, as administratively defined, and use the portion falling within the corresponding boundaries as the subject for human judgment.====Relying on information at the level of cities, towns and villages to shed light on important topics in economic geography has precedents in the literature (Eeckhout, 2004, Levy, 2009; Michaels et al., 2012). Fairly disaggregated administrative units have also been shown to perform as well as gridded cells when dealing with critical topics in the economic geography literature (Briant et al., 2010). An admittedly preferable approach would be to let commuting pattern data delineate local labor markets (Duranton 2015; US Office of Management and Budget, 2010). However, data of this sort are rarely available in developing countries, and India is not an exception in this respect.====In our methodology, four groups of assessors independently judge whether the Google images from a place correspond to an urban or a rural settlement. The four groups differ in their familiarity with India and in their expertise in urban issues. The most knowledgeable group is made of in-house research analysts. A second group comprises university students from the US who have experience in land use classification but no exposure to India. The last two groups are made of crowdsourced anonymous viewers hired through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) who are unlikely to have expertise in urban issues. In the third group all viewers are from India while in the fourth one they are all from the US.====Assessments also follow two different protocols. The more structured one requests the assessors to sequentially evaluate the density of construction, the nature of transport infrastructure, and the availability of urban amenities, before making their judgment. All four groups of assessors follow this protocol. But before doing so, the three outsider groups are also asked to have an impromptu judgment of the urban or rural nature of the place, without any guidance.====By proceeding this way, every place in our sample of cities, towns and villages is classified a total of seven classification rounds. We find that the classifications are highly consistent, with two thirds of the localities having the same status regardless of the group of assessors and the protocol, and with almost 90 percent of them being classified in the same way in at least five of the seven rounds. We also show that the characteristics of the assessors and the protocol followed affect judgment results, but their overall influence is very small. Given this high level of consistency, we pool all seven rounds of assessments which results in 50 or more human judgments for each place in the sample, and then classify every place as urban or rural based on a majority rule. We treat this pooled classification as the outcome of our human judgment exercise.====We then to develop an approach to predict urban status, as assessed through human judgment, based on observable characteristics of the corresponding places. We emphasize four characteristics for each place. Total population and population density, both drawn from the population census, are key indicators in the urban economics literature. Built-up cover and nighttime lights, both from satellite imageries, have been at the core of recent attempts to estimate a country's “true” urbanization rate. We also consider other indicators, but the four key characteristics just listed remain the most important predictors of subjective urban status.====Several approaches, drawn from classical data modeling and from machine learning, are applied for the prediction exercise as well. We first use a standard Logit model linking the urban status of a place with the values of its characteristics. We then apply more sophisticated machine learning methods, including LASSO and random forests. We find that all three approaches yield a similar prediction accuracy, with random forests performing slightly better. These approaches are then used to predict whether each of the other places in the country is urban or rural in practice.====The urbanization rate emerging from this exercise for India's is 29.9 percent. Unlike the remarkably high rates reported by some studies, this figure is quite close to the corresponding official estimate. However, we also find important gaps with the official estimates at more disaggregated levels. Consistent with those other, recent studies, we show that many places administratively defined as villages have urban characteristics. But we also find that a significant share of “statutory towns” and “census towns” would be better classified as rural. And there are differences across states as well.====While these subnational gaps with the official estimates could be interpreted as the outcome of prediction error, we show that the sign of the gaps is consistent with the fiscal incentives and statistical innovations characterizing the administrative classification of places in India. We also show that our estimate of the urbanization rate is not an outlier relative to estimates based on global urban layer products, as the main discrepancy with them arises from the population data used, rather from the underlying land use classification.====Beyond offering new insights into the debate on urbanization in India, the exercise in this paper illustrates several strengths of the proposed methodology. First, the methodology is holistic. Because it relies on human judgment to assess the “urbanness” of places, it allows the multiple characteristics of a place to be evaluated jointly. Second, it makes the most of existing data. A growing number of studies are using satellite imagery data to identify urban areas, contributing to urban studies (Donaldson and Storeygard, 2016). However, our analysis shows that relying on built-up cover or nighttime lights alone can be insufficient. And third, our methodology is scalable. High-quality Google images are becoming available for an increasing number of places, and human judgment can be crowd-sourced efficiently nowadays.====A legitimate concern with our methodology is its reliability, in the sense that small changes to its design could result in important changes in its outcomes. However, the variants tried in this paper suggest that the results are robust. Our analysis shows that assessor characteristics and decision protocols do not significantly affect the classification of places. And the prediction approaches used to extend the classification beyond the original sample do not make a major difference either. Therefore, the proposed methodology may contribute to a growing literature in urban economics that applies innovative approaches to the identification of urban areas (de Bellefon et al. 2018; Diegel et al., 2019; Rozenfeld et al., 2011).====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the stratified sampling strategy. In Section 3 we describe the images used for assessment and the collection of human judgments from different assessors. We also compare classifications based on different human judgment exercises. In Section 4 we introduce the additional sources of data and apply three approaches—Logit model, and LASSO and random forests methods—to predict the urban status of places in the sample. In Section 5 we show the results on the estimated urbanization rate for India in 2011, and also for fine administrative types and for states. Finally, we compare our results with urbanization rates from other studies.",Identifying urban areas by combining human judgment and machine learning: An application to India,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019301068,24 December 2019,2019,Research Article,77.0

We define as urban any area with statistically significant excess building density.

Finally, we develop novel one- and two-sided tests that provide a statistical basis to compare maps with different delineations, which we use to assess the robustness of our approach and to document large differences between our preferred delineation and the corresponding official one.====Delineating urban areas is important for at least two reasons. First, urban research obviously needs to define its object. Extant administrative units such as municipalities do not generally constitute self-contained, functionally autonomous units.==== Second, inappropriately defined units may lead to a variety of biases. Urban areas that are defined too narrowly or too broadly may fall foul of the modifiable areal unit problem (====) by, for instance, misstating the extent of urban sprawl or by missing important positive or negative spatial spillovers of urban policy interventions.====To delineate urban areas, the first key choice regards what to consider to define functionally integrated units: flows of commuters (or perhaps other flows) or some form of proximity between people or between buildings. Flows of commuters are meant to capture integrated labour markets while morphological approaches that rely on physical proximity or contiguity arguably reflect a broad set of interactions.==== Although we believe both types of definitions are legitimate, our approach falls into this second category. Some of the innovations we make with our statistical approach are fairly straightforward to implement with a morphological approach categorising pixels on a map but would be more difficult to adapt to flows of commuters.====To develop and implement our approach, we face four main challenges. The first is to avoid arbitrary thresholds. Official definitions typically aggregate arbitrarily-defined administrative units using a set of ad hoc rules mandating, among others, pre-defined urban cores, minimum population thresholds, minimum distances between constructions, or minimum shares or numbers of commuters, etc. While the use of thresholds is unavoidable for any approach that seeks to discretise a continuous territory into urban and rural areas, the main decisions that underlie our delineation are grounded either in maximisation criteria or in standard statistical thresholds associated with our dartboard methodology. This is our first innovation.====Our second challenge is to gather appropriate data to implement our approach. We use high-resolution data describing the built environment of an entire country. Data about individual buildings are preferable to population data since (residential) population data primarily describe where people sleep at night. As a result, an approach using population data may fail to classify as urban large central business districts devoid of residents. To avoid counterfactual distributions with buildings in the middle of bodies of water or on the peak of the highest mountains, we also need detailed data to describe the natural environment. Finally, the computation of population for the urban areas that we delineate also requires high-resolution data for population. We gathered these data for France. Although such detailed and comprehensive data are unfortunately not yet available for many countries, in robustness checks we implement our approach using less than ideal but more readily available data, including the builtup footprint of pixels or their residential population.====Any delineation of urban areas should also be consistent with a description of their internal geography. This is our third challenge. To go beyond an urban vs. rural classification of pixels, we propose extensions of our approach that allow us to distinguish highly urbanised, or ‘core’, urban pixels from regular urban pixels. Within urban areas, these extensions to our approach also allow us to isolate centres, subcentres, and their surrounding areas.====Our final challenge is to provide a statistically-grounded approach to compare different delineations, such as delineations generated by different variants of our approach or our preferred delineation and official ones. Whether two settlements form a single unified urban area or two separate ones may depend on a few ‘joining’ pixels which may be close to the threshold of being urban. This type of situation may sometimes lead to the delineation of a single urban area and sometimes to the delineation of two. It is desirable to assess how much of the differences between two delineations is due to sampling instead of true methodological differences. Being able to assess the importance of sampling is our last main innovation.====Our work contributes to the literature that seeks to define urban areas, and more generally any form of spatial units. A long-standing concern in the literature has been to provide a rigourous definition of urban or metropolitan areas, first relying on a notion of central places (Berry, 1960, Fox, Kumar, 1965), then integrated local labour markets (Berry, Lobley, Goheen, Goldstein, 1969, Kanemoto, Kurima, 2005, Duranton, 2015), contiguous development (Rozenfeld et al., 2011), or various forms of spatial interactions measured, in particular, with land prices (Bode, 2008, Corvers, Hensen, Bongaerts, 2009). A second concern in the literature has been to develop robust approaches with minimal data requirements so that urban areas can be delineated in a comparable manner over several countries (Hall, Hay, 1980, Cheshire, Hay, 1989). Within spatial units, there is also a recurring interest in the formal definition of urban centres and counts of subcentres (see McDonald, 1987, Giuliano, Small, 1991, McMillen, 2001, and related litterature).====There has been a renewed interest in delineating urban areas in the recent past. Concerns about urbanisation and cities in policy and development circles (e.g., Asian Development Bank, 2019, CAF Development Bank of Latin America, 2017, Ferreyra, Roberts, 2018, for the World Bank) have led to a number of attempts to delineate urban areas for comparative purpose using night-time lights from satellite data (Ch, Martin, Vargas, Davis, Dingel, Miscio, 2020), a combination of night- and day-time lights (Baragwanath-Vogel et al., 2020) or gridded population data (Dijkstra, Florczyk, Freire, Kemper, Pesaresi, Henderson, Kriticos, Nigmatulina, 2020, Moreno-Monroy, Schiavina, Veneri). Comparability across countries imposes some limitations to the methodology being adopted and the data being used. We can label these approaches as ‘wide but shallow’.====New sources of data, sometimes unique to particular countries, have given instead some impetus for ‘deep but narrow’ approaches. Like us, Arribas-Bel et al., 2019 exploit a detailed map of all buildings for Spain. They develop a clustering algorithm to classify cities. A different approach is taken by Galdo et al. (2019) who use a variety of data sources combined with human judgement for a small subsample of locations in India. Human judgement is then mechanically replicated for the whole of India. Bosker et al. (2018) propose another type of ‘deep but narrow’ approach. They use commuting data together with many other sources to look at differences in the delineation of urban areas for Indonesia across a broad variety of approaches. In the spirit of Briant et al. (2010), they also explore the implications of different delineations for the estimation of a number of urban relationships. While our main approach belongs to this second group, we also propose a simplified version of what we do that can be implemented using widely available gridded data.====Our work is also related to a large literature in spatial statistics that relies on dartboard counterfactuals. Much of that work is concerned with detecting spatial concentration from the distribution of distances between its objects of interests, such as establishments within the same industry (Duranton and Overman, 2005). Unfortunately, we cannot adapt this type of approach to buildings since it would only tell us whether buildings are spatially concentrated (and at which spatial scale) but not whether a specific group of buildings forms an urban area. There is a literature that attempts to detect clusters of particular sectors of economic activity in adjacent areas. See Mori et al. (2014) for a recent development. A key endeavour in this literature is to isolate a single or multiple clusters by grouping contiguous discrete regions. Our approach uses instead ‘arbitrarily small’ spatial units and relies on detecting excess smoothed density. While more demanding in terms of data, this allows us to treat geographic space as a quasi-continuum and bypass the difficult computations associated with finding the best cluster of regions or the best set of clusters. Billings and Johnson (2012) propose an approach closer in spirit to ours but they use it to assess industrial specialisation instead of clusters.",Delineating urban areas using building density,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019301032,20 December 2019,2019,Research Article,78.0

The extent of agglomeration economies help determine the role of urban pull factors in the urbanization process within and across regions of the world. Sub-Saharan Africa has had more rapid urban population growth than any other region over the last half century. Its urban population share grew from 14% in 1950 to 41% in 2015 and is predicted to be 60% in 2050 according to the UN (2015). This rapid urbanization is driven by forces pushing people out of rural areas and pulling them into cities as reviewed for Sub-Saharan Africa in Henderson and Kriticos (2018). Push factors include changes in agricultural technology which release workers from land (e.g. Matsuyama (1992); Gollin et al. (2007), and Bustos et al. (2016)) as well as adverse climate and conflict in rural areas (e.g., Henderson, Storeygard, Deichmann, 2017, Fay, Opal, 1999, Barrios, Bertinelli, Strobl, 2006, Brückner, 2012). With some exceptions such as Gollin et al. (2013), the literature on Sub-Saharan Africa has focused on push factors as driving urbanization. Here, like Gollin et al. (2013), we argue that the income gains associated with moving to cities from rural areas are high in Sub-Saharan Africa, pulling people into cities, albeit in the face of poor productivity in the rural sector. We also show that, within the urban sector, there are huge gains to moving to denser agglomerations.====There is a vast literature that has traditionally focused on developed countries - such as the USA - which estimates the productivity or wage premiums from being in cities compared to rural areas, or from being in bigger versus smaller, or denser versus less dense cities (e.g Ciccone, Hall, 1996, Glaeser, Mare, 2001), with reviews of the literature in Combes and Gobillon (2015) and Rosenthal and Strange (2004). The literature argues that premiums exist because agglomeration gives proximity among firms, workers and people, which allows economic agents to economize on local trade costs, spread information and ideas more easily, diversify the range of products produced, and access larger pools of workers and jobs (Duranton, 2015). Recently, there has been more work on developing countries with, for example, papers on Latin America (Quintero and Roberts, 2018), Colombia (Duranton, 2016), China (Combes et al., 2019), and a comparison of Brazil, China, India and the USA by Chauvin et al. (2017).====Wage premiums in developing countries may be larger because their small informal sector firms and poorly educated entrepreneurs and workers are more reliant on their external environment, so that the agglomeration factors and externalities noted above may play a bigger role than in developed countries. Duranton (2015) argues that returns to density will be larger in developing countries. That said, other papers suggest that for Sub-Saharan Africa, cities have low economic density or proximity, resulting in lowered spillovers (Collier, Jones, 2016, Venables, 2018, Lall, Henderson, Venables, 2017) and suppressing gains from urbanization. Low economic density arises, for example, if economic activity is not very clustered but scattered throughout the city, potentially because of the high costs of commuting within cities inducing firms to locate nearer to residents as in Fujita and Ogawa (1982), with corresponding empirical work in Heblich et al. (2018). In Appendix D, we examine whether large cities in Sub-Saharan Africa have a lower degree of density and clustering of economic activity relative to the rest of the world. Using LandScan (2012) data, we find that these cities in fact generally have higher density and clustering measures than Latin American cities, and measures that are comparable to Asian cities. That said there is enormous variation in density across Sub-Saharan African cities of similar populations and these density differences drive huge wage and income differences.====Testing the gains from proximity and agglomeration in Sub-Saharan Africa, or elsewhere, involves three critical aspects of measurement, hitherto under-explored in the previous literature. First is how cities are defined, with an eye to establishing consistency in how densities are measured across cities, where density will be a key measure of agglomeration. The main problem concerns the extent of the land area over which a city is defined. The land area and its corresponding population are typically defined by administrative boundaries, rather than economic ‘boundaries’ related to density. More specifically, the definitions of cities and urbanized areas chosen by national statistics bureaus are typically based on pre-determined administrative units which are defined as either urban or not, based on qualitative aspects of land use and the built environment, such as the degree of centrality of activity, total population and the like. In some countries, population density plays a role in the definition but typically not a central one. Contiguous urban administrative units are then aggregated into a metropolitan or urban area. If land areas are based on administrative units which have populated and unpopulated parts and inconsistently defined across countries or regions within countries, then density measures will fail to capture the ==== economic density at which a city’s activity operates. Put differently there can be large measurement error leading to attenuation bias, as we will demonstrate.====The second measurement aspect is to determine what specific population and density related measures best capture agglomeration forces, or best capture what we term economic density, the forces driving income and wage premiums. Most studies adopt specific, simple measures of agglomeration such as indicator variables for settlement type (e.g. urban versus rural), a continuous total population measure, or at best, a basic population density measure, where as noted the denominator (effective land area) is typically ill-defined across cities. Studies usually pick one specific measure with little analysis as to why and no quantitative evaluation of what measure(s) would be most relevant.====The third measurement aspect concerns outcomes. Outcomes in the literature are specified either as firm productivity or individual wages, but not household incomes. For rapidly urbanizing regions, in the long term it is more households that ultimately move to cities. If household gains from being in urban areas differ from wage rate gains, that is a critical factor in studying urbanization.====This paper differs in each of these three dimensions. A novel part of our work will be to have consistent city boundaries based on fine scale density measurements, which will reduce measurement error and provide really nice results. We will consistently define metropolitan areas across countries, based on population and population density thresholds. Second, we will focus on an evaluation of different agglomeration aspects starting with traditional options: urban versus rural, a continuous total population measure, and a continuous measure of overall population density. However, these measures do not capture, for a given population and a given overall density, the degree to which economic activity is clustered within a city. Two cities with the same density and population may have very different levels of clustering of economic activity within the city, and they can be captured by other measures reflecting variation in population densities within a city (De La Roca, Puga, 2017, Collier, Jones, Spijkerman, 2018). We derive and utilize several such measures. Third, we will focus not just on wage rates, but, as a novel feature, on household incomes. Agglomeration effects will be much higher for household incomes and we will explore reasons why.====Specifically, the paper will examine how well different economic density measures explain household income and wage differentials across space for a set of six Sub-Saharan Africa countries whose total population is about 430 million. Our sample covers the rural sector, 193 low-density urban settlements with over 5000 people, and 120 high-density cities with over 50,000 people. Using populations at the 1 km grid square level, we aggregate contiguous squares of high density to create cities – which are the consolidation of an urban core and a surrounding lower density fringe – and aggregate contiguous squares of lower density places to create stand-alone, low density settlements, which from now on we will call towns. While admittedly the density and population thresholds we choose below are to some degree arbitrary, they are based on types of thresholds some countries and researchers cite, or use in the case of OECD (2012).====For the measurement of agglomeration economies, there is the issue of determining relevant spatial scales. For example, does it matter whether you are just in a particular city or what part of the city you are in? First we examine how marginal scale effects, or elasticities, vary across the spatial hierarchy: rural areas, towns, and cities. Then for cities, while most papers explore agglomeration benefits at the level of a city or county, a few papers look within cities at the extent of spatial decay, finding a very rapid spatial decay of certain types of scale externalities (Arzaghi, Henderson, 2008, Rosenthal, Strange, 2008). Here we explore both city level and neighborhood effects together: those from overall city economic density and from own local neighborhood economic density. We will ask also if people living in the urban core versus fringe of the city benefit differently from overall density characteristics of the city.====In the paper, Section 1 starts with how we define cities and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the LandScan (2012) data set that we use. Section 2 defines various measures of economic density for urbanized and rural areas, decomposing them into first and second moment components. Section 3 looks at the relationship between different measures of economic density and income differentials across the whole spatial hierarchy. Section 4 looks specifically at cities and examines issues such as the optimal rate of spatial discount for De La Roca and Puga (2017) measures of neighbor effects; the role of spatial variation in density within a city; how important local density measures are within cities, as well as location within the city; and what factors may underlie the huge income gains to families from moving to high density places.

Compared to markets defined using minimum thresholds for nighttime light intensity, daytime imagery identify an order of magnitude more markets, capture more of India’s urban population, are more realistically jagged in shape, and reveal more variation in the spatial distribution of economic activity. We conclude that daytime satellite data are a promising source for the study of urban forms.","Core to the study of economic geography is explaining why cities exist and how their dimensions are determined. It is standard to attribute the existence of cities to the benefits of agglomeration—be they conventional agglomeration economies (e.g., Henderson, 1974, Duranton, Puga, 2001), or home-market effects derived in new-economic-geography models (e.g., Fujita et al., 2001). Where cities locate, in turn, is influenced by the availability of key resources, access to transportation routes, and historical accident (e.g., Bleakley, Lin, 2012, Henderson, Squires, Storeygard, Weil, 2018). Within cities, the clustering of activity creates gradients in land prices and presents workers with a tradeoff between housing costs and commute times (Duranton and Puga, 2015). A rich and vibrant literature studies how the concentrating forces of agglomeration and the dispersing forces of congestion combine to create urban systems (e.g., Duranton, Puga, 2004, Desmet, Henderson, 2015).====Empirical work on economic geography requires measuring the location and scale of urban activity. A common approach to measurement is to use officially designated administrative units. These may be as large as a metropolitan area (e.g., Duranton and Turner, 2012), as small as a town or village (e.g., Eeckhout, 2004), or an intermediately sized unit such as a county or a district (e.g., Hanson, 2005, Ghani, Goswami, Kerr, 2014, Donaldson, Hornbeck, 2016). Because administrative boundaries are defined according to pre-existing legal jurisdictions, they may be noisy indicators of how cities are actually organized. In influential work, Rozenfeld et al. (2011) construct cities by clustering officially designated towns and villages into larger units based on geographic proximity. This approach only works, however, if official sources measure activity for fine administrative units on a frequent basis. In many countries, such data are available only decadally, if at all.====In this paper, we use remotely sensed data to detect urban markets in India for 2013. A ==== is a set of contiguous, or near contiguous, pixels that contain economic activity according to daytime or nighttime satellite imagery. Our practical approach approximates the conceptual definition of a market in economic geography models: a set of locations that are highly integrated relative to outside locations because of low internal trade costs (e.g., Redding, 2016) and (or) low commuting costs (e.g., Duranton, 2015). We categorize a pixel as having economic activity if its nighttime light intensity exceeds a given threshold or its spectral properties indicate builtup landcover. Our maintained assumption is that clusters of proximate pixels are integrated through internal trade and commuting links, which we attempt to validate in external data.====Our first source of imagery is nighttime lights from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System, which indicates the presence of economically active agents (Henderson et al., 2012). Following Rozenfeld et al. (2011), we explore buffers that combine contiguous sets of pixels if they lie within a radius of 1 km, 2 km, 4 km or 8 km. Defining urban land using nightlights requires choosing a minimum threshold of light intensity for contiguous pixels. Harari (2017), for instance, in her analysis of urban sprawl in large Indian cities chooses a digital number (DN) of 35 (on a scale of 0 to 63) to designate urban areas. Our analysis reveals a tradeoff in choosing the minimum light threshold for a market: while a strict threshold only captures major urban agglomerations, lowering the threshold to include smaller cities explodes the size of larger cities with proximate satellites. This tradeoff is a consequence of the blooming effect of light, which produces cities whose boundaries are too expansive and too smooth relative to actual cities.====We contrast the spatial extent of nightlight-based markets with those formed from high-resolution daytime satellite imagery. These data are available at finer resolutions than nighttime lights data but require further image classification to detect urban land. We explore data on builtup landcover from the MODIS layer constructed by Channan et al. (2014). We also examine two additional daytime imagery layers: the Global Human Settlements Layer (Pesaresi et al., 2015) and a recent layer produced by Goldblatt et al. (2018). We define landcover-based markets using an analogous algorithm that clusters contiguous or near contiguous pixels of builtup landcover.====Our approach has three advantages over conventional methods to measure urban areas using administrative data. First, it is scalable. Because our method is algorithmic and uses publicly available imagery, it scales to detect markets globally and, in principle, over time. It also circumvents the need to reconcile differences across countries and time in how administrative units are defined. Second, and relatedly, our data do not stop at national borders. Markets that straddle national boundaries along transportation routes can be tracked. Third, the spatial resolution is adjustable. By altering the buffer used to aggregate proximate pixels, we can narrow the focus to the rough equivalent of a town center or widen the focus to a metropolitan area. This versatility is helpful for detecting within-metro area heterogeneity, a feature we explore.====To preview our results, the patterns of landcover-based markets are starkly different from those of nightlight-based markets. Using the definition of a market that buffers clusters of contiguous pixels at 1 km, we detect 1669 and 469 markets using a nightlight threshold of DN33 and DN60, respectively. The DN60 markets accurately capture India’s largest 470 cities according to official Census data, which suggests that nightlight-based markets are reliable for tracking activity across India’s major urban areas. In contrast, we detect an order of magnitude more markets using MODIS data: 12,953 in total. These markets are smaller, less compact, more closely fit a power law in area size, and capture activity ranging from distinct areas within large metropolises to small towns that are distant from India’s major cities. For example, within Delhi’s official administrative boundary, we detect 579 distinct 1 km MODIS markets. More remote, landcover-based markets have an average DN nightlight intensity of just 5, suggesting that we are able to capture many parts of India that lack reliable access to electricity. While we could detect these markets with nightlight data by lowering the light-intensity threshold, this would come at the cost of vastly increasing the area of above-threshold contiguous pixels around India’s large cities, which is evident from visual inspection and from statistics on the maximum size of markets at different thresholds. Our results suggest that landcover-based markets are able to capture small cities and towns in India while preserving the spatial distribution of activity of the largest cities.====We perform several validation checks to demonstrate that our markets capture real economic activity. Using shape files for the 2011 India Census, we allocate population across our market boundaries. Collectively, the DN33 and DN60 1 km markets contain 23.4% and 14.8% of India’s total population and 75.3% and 47.6% of India’s urban population, respectively. The MODIS 1 km markets capture 29.0% and 93.2% of India’s total and urban populations, respectively. Market size correlates strongly with population, and the variance in population for smaller sized landcover markets reflects the fact that these markets include both dense areas within major metro areas and less populated peripheral towns. We detect strong correlations between market size and proximity to public infrastructure, such as roads, railway stations and mobile phone towers. Additionally, we find that larger landcover-based markets have higher nighttime light intensity. These correlations are important for addressing a limitation of daytime satellite data. While these data are suitable for measuring the spatial extent of markets, they may not reveal the intensity of economic activity. However, the positive correlations reveal that the extensive margin—which is measured accurately through daytime imagery—correlates well with proxies for the intensive margin. For example, a MODIS market at the 10th percentile of the land-area distribution has a nightlight DN of 9.4 compared to 27.2 for a market at the 90th percentile of land area.==== Combining daytime imagery to measure the boundary of markets with nighttime data to measure the intensity of activity is a promising approach to leverage two remotely sensed datasets that are publicly available, have a long time span, and have global coverage.====Finally, we consider the potential to use landcover-based markets to study polycentric cities (Duranton and Puga, 2015). The literature has long recognized that cities do not expand smoothly along their margins but through the construction of outlying communities in the form of suburbs, edge cities, or commercial hubs (e.g., Henderson, Mitra, 1996, Anas, Arnott, Small, 1998). For example, the Hyderabad metro area, which spans 650 km==== and contains 6.8 million people, contains Hyderabad and Secunderabad as major poles and substantial satellites in Ghatkesar and Kukatpally. As one zooms in further, many more satellites appear and Hyderabad’s full polycentricity is revealed. We examine polycentricity using the larger buffered markets, which we term “super-markets”. The average MODIS 8 km market spans an area of 63.4 km====, but physical structures cover only 23% of this area. On average, these super-markets contain 4.2 distinct 1 km markets; the elasticity of the number of 1 km buffered markets with respect to super-market area size is 0.36. This within-market variation may be sufficient to study, for instance, how transportation investments, such as ring roads or metro rail, impact the distribution of economic activity within large cities. To demonstrate this possibility, we construct measures of market access based on Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) and find that a non-trivial portion of a market’s access is determined by other close-by markets that are within the same larger buffered super-market.====The availability of satellite imagery and machine-learning techniques for image classification have led to rapid advances in detecting land use in the remote sensing literature. In efforts to construct urban layers for the world as a whole, Pesaresi et al. (2015) use Landsat imagery to detect urban land for grid cells at a 38 m resolution, Channan et al. (2014) use MODIS imagery to detect multiple types of land use for grid cells at a 500 m resolution, and Zhou et al. (2015) use nightlight intensity to detect urban land at a 1 km resolution.==== This work typically classifies land use at the pixel level, where the dimensions of the pixels vary according to the source of the satellite imagery. Pixel-level classifications, while important building blocks in urban analysis, are not in and of themselves informative for the study of economic geography. Without aggregating pixels to form larger markets, one cannot test theories of the size distribution of cities, evaluate the impacts of expanding national transportation grids, or identify the consequences of severe weather events, plant closures, or other localized economic shocks.====Our results contribute most directly to the efforts to delineate urban areas that do not rely on administrative boundaries. In addition to Rozenfeld et al. (2011), our paper has antecedents in Eeckhout (2004), who uses U.S. Census Designated Places instead of (much larger) Metropolitan Statistical Areas to re-examine Zipf’s law and Gibrat’s law; Burchfield et al. (2006), who use contiguous pixels to measure sprawl in the U.S. based on Landsat satellite imagery from 1976 to 1992; and Harari (2017), who uses nightlights to track urban sprawl in large Indian metropolitan areas. Davis et al. (2019) also use clusters of pixels above nightlight thresholds to construct metro areas in Brazil, China, and India. Recent work by Duranton (2015) proposes an alternative algorithm to construct markets based on commuting patterns for Colombia. de Bellefon et al. (2019) develop a statistical approach to detect urban areas using precise locational data covering 34 million buildings in France. Our contribution to this literature is to develop and compare methods to detect markets solely from remotely sensed data, and in particular daytime imagery.====More broadly, our paper builds on the increasing use of remotely sensed data for economic analysis. Economists have used satellite data on the intensity of light emitted at night to study national and regional economic growth (Henderson, Storeygard, Weil, 2012, Gennaioli, Porta, de Silanes, Shleifer, 2013, Pinkovskiy, Sala-i Martin, 2016), the political economy of regional development (Gennaioli, Porta, de Silanes, Shleifer, 2013, Michalopoulos, Papaioannou, 2013, Michalopoulos, Papaioannou, 2013), spatial linkages between cities (Storeygard, 2016), and the global distribution of economic activity (Henderson et al., 2018), among a rapidly growing set of topics. Daytime satellite imagery, whose use in economics was pioneered by Burchfield et al. (2006), is available at even higher spatial resolutions, down to 30 m for data going back to the late 1990s and down to less than 1 m for imagery from recently launched proprietary satellites. Michaels et al. (2018) use an ensemble of remotely sensed imagery to measure urbanization in Tanzania. For a comprehensive survey of recent work, see Donaldson and Storeygard (2016).====Section 2 presents the method to detect markets from satellite imagery. Section 3 compares nightlight-based markets and landcover-based markets and provides validation checks. Section 4 uses landcover-based markets to evaluate market access.

Examining variation in relative quantities and prices of skill across these metropolitan areas, we conclude that agglomeration is also skill-biased in Brazil, China, and India.","This paper studies the distribution of skills across and within cities in three large developing economies: Brazil, China, and India. These three countries jointly account for approximately 40% of the world’s population and are diverse in their levels of income. The process of urbanization in developing economies is important due to both the number of people involved and the opportunity to shape outcomes. The World Bank projects that 2.7 billion additional people will live in cities in developing economies by 2050. While urbanization does not necessarily imply growth, the two are nonetheless strongly linked (Henderson, 2014).====In developed economies, agglomeration appears to be skill-biased. There is a well-known positive relationship between metropolitan population and the share of the population possessing a college degree (Costa, Kahn, 2000, Moretti, 2004, Bacolod, Blum, Strange, 2009). Davis and Dingel (2017) study more narrowly defined educational categories and document that larger cities are skill-abundant and specialize in skill-intensive activities. Despite this greater relative supply of skill in larger cities, the college wage premium is also higher in larger cities (Baum-Snow, Pavan, 2013, Davis, Dingel, 2019). The implied greater relative demand for skill in larger cities suggests that agglomeration complements skill in production (Giannone, 2018). Within US metropolitan areas, more skilled residents have increasingly moved to city centers in the last two decades (Couture and Handbury, 2017).====Do the urban systems of developing economies also exhibit these spatial patterns? This paper is a first step in characterizing the spatial distributions of skills and sectors in Brazil, China, and India. Cities in developing economies will not necessarily mirror corresponding characteristics of developed economies. The existence of cities still requires agglomeration and dispersion forces, but the technologies and conditions of production and consumption in cities can diverge sharply. It is an empirical question whether developing economies’ larger cities are populated by more skilled residents who earn relatively higher wages and live near the city center. We begin to tackle this question by examining some of these patterns in three large developing economies.====Studying the distribution of skills across and within metropolitan areas in Brazil, China, and India necessitates constructing metropolitan areas consistent with our economic inquiry. Economic theory treats a city as a highly – if imperfectly – integrated labor market. For this and other reasons, statistical agencies in developed economies overwhelmingly define metropolitan areas on the basis of commuting flows (Duranton, 2015). Unfortunately, such commuting flow measures are not always available to define metropolitan areas in developing economies. This is the case in China and India. In practice, researchers studying cities in developing economies have employed a variety of measures of the relevant geographies, often using off-the-shelf administrative definitions of cities. These spatial units often do not correspond to the metropolitan areas employed in research describing cities in developed economies. Administrative or political boundaries can fragment economically integrated areas into distinct cities or circumscribe places, including rural areas, that are not integrated metropolises. Assessing whether developing economies exhibit spatial patterns of skills similar to those of developed economies requires an appropriate geography defining cities’ sizes and economic characteristics.====In Section 2, we develop a method to define metropolitan areas in the absence of commuting data by using satellite images. Our approach aggregates spatial units into metropolitan areas on the basis of lights at night. When municipalities or towns are part of a sufficiently bright, contiguous area of light, they belong to that metropolitan area. We demonstrate the feasibility and value of such an approach in three steps. First, we show that, with appropriately selected light-intensity thresholds, our night-lights–based method produces metropolitan areas that match commuting-defined US metropolitan areas very well. Second, we show that this is also true in a developing-economy setting, Brazil, where data on both commuting flows and night lights are available. Third, the application of our night-lights–based approach to China and India eliminates anomalies in their city-size distributions. While spatial units defined by administrative boundaries in these countries seem to deviate from a power-law distribution (Chauvin et al., 2017), our night-lights–based definitions of cities accord much better with the empirical regularity exhibited in developed economies.====Using these definitions of metropolitan areas, we aggregate census data to characterize the spatial distributions of skills across metropolitan areas in Section 3. We characterize spatial variation in relative quantities of skill by employing a linear regression implied by the theory of Davis and Dingel (2017). In all three developing economies, larger cities are skill-abundant. This result is robust to our choice of the light-intensity threshold employed in our algorithm defining metropolitan areas. However, we obtain substantially different population elasticities in some cases when using the administrative definitions of spatial units that have been commonly used in previous research.====We also characterize within-metro variation in quantities of skill for Brazil and China (Section 4) and spatial patterns of wages for Brazil (Section 5). In both Brazil and China, more skilled residents tend to live closer to the center of metropolitan areas. In Brazil, college wage premia are higher in more populous cities, consistent with developed-economy patterns and the hypothesis that agglomeration increases productivity in a skill-biased manner. The limited scope of this part of our investigation is dictated by data availability. Studies that use satellite imagery to both define urban markets and measure outcomes, such as Baragwanath Vogel et al. (2018), do not face such limitations. But in the absence of satellite-based means of measuring skill-related outcomes, we must employ both satellite and administrative data to answer fundamental questions about the urban systems of developing economies.====Our paper belongs to a growing literature on urbanization in developing economies. Perhaps most closely related are Henderson (1991) and Chauvin et al. (2017), who also focus on urban development in Brazil, China, and India, and Hu et al. (2014), who study China. In particular, Chauvin et al. (2017) examine whether stylized facts about metropolitan areas in the United States also hold true in Brazil, China, and India using administrative spatial units commonly available in government data releases. Hu et al. (2014) examine the predictions of Davis and Dingel (2017) for China using administrative spatial units. Our investigation complements these studies by focusing on the spatial distribution of skills and developing definitions of metropolitan areas that are more comparable to the economically integrated entities studied in research on developed-economy cities.====Our night-lights–based approach to defining metropolitan areas is distinct from the administrative units defined by government statistical agencies, a commuting-based algorithm introduced by Duranton (2015), and a distance-based clustering algorithm introduced by Rozenfeld et al. (2011). The administrative units defined by government agencies often do not correspond to the integrated metropolitan areas of interest to economists. The commuting-based approach is ideal, but its application is constrained by the absence of economy-wide commuting data in many countries. The city-clustering algorithm of Rozenfeld et al. (2011) aggregates adjacent spatial units on the basis of proximity without exploiting information about the contiguity of economic activity. We use night lights, which are available at very fine spatial resolution, to inform the aggregation of spatial units for which socioeconomic data are available.====Our employment of satellite imagery to define metropolitan areas belongs to a rapidly expanding economics literature exploiting satellite data, recently surveyed by Donaldson and Storeygard (2016). The use of satellite imagery to infer urban extent dates at least to Welch (1980), who inferred Chinese cities’ populations from their built-up areas in the absence of a population census. Much of the recent economics research, such as Bleakley and Lin (2012), Henderson et al. (2012) and Storeygard (2016), has utilized night lights as a proxy for local economic activity at a finer resolution than typically documented in administrative data. We use night lights as a basis for identifying contiguous areas of economic activity that define metropolitan areas and then characterize those metropolitan areas’ socioeconomic characteristics by aggregating spatial units available in more traditional data sources. Our application to India is similar to Harari (2017), who defines Indian cities’ spatial extent using night lights, aggregates population counts for these footprints, and relates cities’ economic outcomes to their compactness. Relative to her work, we validate the lights-based approach by comparing it to commuting-based definitions, show that lights-based metropolitan areas differ substantially from the geographic units used in much prior research on Brazil, China, and India, and characterize the spatial distributions of skills in these three economies.","Cities, lights, and skills in developing economies",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300439,23 May 2019,2019,Research Article,82.0
Duranton Gilles,"Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA","Available online 22 April 2021, Version of Record 5 October 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2021.103353,Cited by (6),This paper provides a discussion of the choices that need to be made to classify locations and aggregate them into larger units such as cities or metropolitan areas. It also selectively surveys related literature with a focus on the contributions published in this special issue.,"Although this special issue is entitled ``Delineating Metropolitan Areas’’, the ten contributions that follow go far beyond just metropolitan areas and propose a diversity of approaches to delineate geographical space and classify locations into various categories: urban, rural, suburban, cities, metropolitan areas, urban regions, centers and sub-centers within cities, etc. Although more abstract and perhaps pedantic-sounding, the title of this introduction better reflects the collective enterprise of this special issue. This title is also implicitly saying there is no one single true approach to delineation. Instead, depending on what we want from a delineation, different approaches may be appropriate. The corollary of this proposition is that the diversity of methodologies found in the ten papers published in this special issue is a strength, not the sign of a failed quest for a single best approach.====Why do we want to delineate space? In particular, why do we want to delineate cities aside from existing administrative units? We can see three broad reasons. The first is to produce facts about cities while making sure that we compare likes with likes. For example, the municipality of Saint Louis (M.O.) in the United States has a population of about 300,000 while that of Charlotte (S.C.) nears a million. At the same time, the U.S. Census Bureau says that the metropolitan population of these two cities is roughly the same at 2.6–2.8 million. The city of Saint Louis looks small only because of the whimsical nature of its administrative boundaries. As argued by Dijkstra et al. (2021), in this issue this boundary problem is even worse when looking across countries with wildly different definitions. To qualify as a city, a settlement in China needs to host at least 100,000 inhabitants whereas 200 is enough in Denmark.====Second, to understand anything about fundamental urban questions such as urban population growth, urban expansion, urban segregation, or even the internal structure of cities, meaningful and appropriate definitions are needed. Finally, reasonable delineations of space are also fundamental for policies targeting specific geographies. A rural support policy for instance should arguably target its interventions to ``truly’’ rural areas.====Until very recently, the delineation of space was mainly performed by national statistical offices acting independently from each other. As just argued, this is making cross-country comparisons near impossible. Then, how can we explore the relationship between, say, income per capita and the rate of urbanization, when we do not know whether India is less than 30% urbanized as claimed by the government of India and one paper published here (Galdo et al., 2021) or more than 70% urbanized as claimed by another paper in the same issue (Dijkstra et al., 2021)?====Even in more developed countries, the situation is far from satisfactory. The United States was the first country to define functional urban units in the 1950s. However, its methodology to define metropolitan statistical areas after the Census of 2010 (U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 2010) can only be charitably described as coarse, opaque, convoluted, and eventually arbitrary (see Duranton, 2015, for a more detailed discussion).==== France is arguably a leader in this area today with an apparently meaningful and reproducible methodology. Nonetheless, an attempt to duplicate this methodology on the same data as part of the work reported in de Bellefon et al. (2021) in this issue revealed a need for countless manual adjustments.====A key reason behind this sad state of affair is a lack of academic interest and work on the subject. A bibliographical search reveals only a handful of contributions between the early work of Berry (1960) and two papers which perhaps helped rekindle the interest in this topic (Rozenfeld et al., 2011; Duranton, 2015). With ten papers, this special issue contains more research on the delineation of cities than several decades of past research!====We think this sudden enthusiasm has two main causes. The first is that rising urbanization in the developing world makes cities more salient and creates a demand for more uniform definitions. Second, highly granular data have become available. Obviously, detailed information about the spatial distribution of people and/or buildings is needed to classify space. The greater availability of granular data for many other variables in many countries has been equally instrumental. Delineating cities in a sophisticated way is much more useful when the key variables of an investigation can also be computed for these newly delineated units.",Classifying locations and delineating space: An introduction,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000358,22 April 2021,2021,Research Article,86.0

Difference-in-differences analyses show that, on average, a derailment depreciates housing values within a one-mile radius by 5%–8%. The prices of affected properties return to pre-accident levels after about 480 days. In addition, we find that the impacts of derailments on property values are limited to the local area. These results provide evidence for evaluating the economic costs of rail transportation to nearby communities and for considering policy options in the current era of U.S. energy transformation resulting in substantial increases in the rail shipment of fuels.","Rail transportation carrying hazardous materials (i.e., “hazmat”) raises wide public concerns especially when it passes through urban areas with dense populations (Gawande and Jenkins-Smith 2001). A serious rail accident, such as a derailment, involving hazmat in a populated area can cause human health risks, property damage, evacuation, environmental degradation, and traffic disruption (Erkut et al., 2007). The increasing use of rail for energy fuel transportation due to the unprecedented expansion of domestic energy production in recent years has further intensified public attention on the safety of rail transportation involving hazmat.====A central debate on rail transportation of hazardous petrochemical materials is the comparison between rail and pipeline. Pipeline has been the major vehicle for crude oil transportation during the past decades. The primary protest to pipeline development, however, is the perceived risks. Surprisingly, previous research finds little evidence supporting the relationship between pipeline and property values nearby, largely because most residents are unaware of the existence of pipelines underneath their houses (Hansen et al., 2006; Wilde et al., 2014; Herrnstadt and Sweeney 2017). Rail, as an alternative transportation mode for crude oil, generates higher marginal direct cost than pipeline does. However, rail offers crude oil shippers the flexibility to enter various market regions without making a long-term commitment when the difference between the upstream and downstream prices is substantial (Covert and Kellogg 2017). During the past few years, policymakers have been investigating more stringent regulations on the rail transportation of hazmat==== as well as alternative transportation modes. In order to weigh these policy options, a comprehensive understanding of the costs of railroad accidents involving hazmat is essential. Mason (2018) offers evidence for the positive correlation between the usage of rail for crude oil and rail accidents. He suggests an expected marginal impact of about $2000 per 1000 rail cars carrying oil across states. However, this cost estimation only includes direct costs, such as damage to transportation equipment and nearby properties, and leaves out the implicit costs of rail accidents.====This paper, to our knowledge, provides the first evaluation of the implicit cost of railroad accidents from depressing the value of residential properties==== and offers insights into the welfare impacts on local communities. Specifically, our study focuses on derailments since they are the most serious type of accident and can trigger emergency responses such as evacuations. This study is closely related to the literature on the impacts of actual and perceived disamenities on property values. See studies on airport noise disclosure (Pope 2008a), sex offender disclosure (Pope 2008c; Linden and Rockoff 2008), flood zone changes (Pope 2008b; Gallagher 2014; Shr and Zipp 2019), hurricane risk (Hallstrom and Smith 2005), mercury pollution (Tang et al., 2018) and nuclear accidents (Tanaka and Zabel 2018) for examples.====This study is conducted for New York State (excluding the New York City and Long Island regions) which has experienced rapid growth in energy transportation in recent years as a major receiver of oil transported from the Midwest—the Bakken crude oil production region. We identify 33 derailment events that occurred between 2004 and 2013 and use property transactions within up to five miles on both sides of railroads to quantify the derailment impacts on property values. Analyses are conducted at two spatial scales: Local level (local effect), in which we examine the property value near accident sites, and how effects vary by distance to accident site and over time; and regional level (regional effect), in which we examine how high impact accidents affect all properties near railroads, and how the effects vary by distance to railroads and over time.====We first use local polynomial regression to gauge the spatial and temporal extents of the local effect. Results suggest that, in general, a derailment negatively affects the average values of nearby properties up to one mile from the derailment site. Moreover, the derailment causes an immediate but temporary shock to nearby property values—housing price rebounds to the pre-derailment level after approximately 480 days. We then employ difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to quantify the derailment impact on property values on the local scale. Informed by the results of local polynomial regressions, the DiD model uses transactions within one mile of derailment sites as the treatment group while using transactions further away from the derailment sites as the control group. Results indicate that, within the 480-days-period, derailments cause property values within one mile to decrease by 5%–8%. Using alternative control and treatment group designs and triple difference (DDD) analysis yield similar results.====For the regional effect, we first identify five derailments involving fatalities, injuries, evacuations, or property damage as high impact accidents. For each high impact accident, we perform the local polynomial regression analysis and find no noticeable impact on property prices at any distance from railroads or any time after the accidents. The null result is confirmed by DiD analyses with various specifications. In the regional DiD analyses, we define all transacted properties within half or one mile from railroads as the treatment group while those within one to two miles as the control group. We find no noticeable regional effect within county, metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or state, which suggests that the impacts of derailments are limited to local areas.====To aid the interpretation of these results, we differentiate between two types of disamenities: a) the realized damage from the hazmat spill, including environmental damage, disruptions caused by the cleanup effort, and so on, and b) the risk of future accidents. An accident may change the actual and/or perceived levels of these disamenities. We argue that changes in actual risk level is unlikely given the research design of comparing transactions right before and after accidents.==== Therefore, the local effect is likely caused by changes in actual damage, or changes in perceived damage and/or risk. The price rebound can be explained by cleanup, damage being ignored, or recovery from an overreaction, each with different welfare implications. For the regional effect, the only plausible mechanism is through changes in perceived risk but we find no evidence for that.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides some background on rail accidents in the new energy era. Section 3 describes the dataset and the study area. Section 4 introduces the local polynomial regressions results. Section 5 presents the DiD analyses and robustness checks for the local effect. Section 6 presents the analysis of the regional effect.

We examine the impact of service attributes, including ","Improving the efficiency of urban transport systems and the well-being of commuters has been a major challenge for transport authorities. Unlike the airline, banking, and telecommunication industries, which provide diversified services to cater to the different needs of consumers, public transport services are undifferentiated in many cities. Users are required to adjust their travel preferences to suit the transport services. The research gap with respect to quality of and the satisfaction level with public transport services has attracted the interest of many researchers.====A series of papers in the US ran congestion pricing experiments using major highways, including State Route 91 (SR91) and Interstate 15 (I-15) in southern California, Interstate 10 (I-10) in Houston, and Interstate 394 (I-394) in Minnesota, to examine the travel preferences of motorists (Lam and Small, 2001; Small and Yan, 2001; Small et al., 2005, 2006; Liu et al., 2004, 2007). By evaluating motorists’ choice with respect to the quality of services between express toll lanes and free, albeit congested, lanes in the experiments, these studies provide valuable insights into the value pricing schemes designed to account for motorists’ heterogeneous preferences for travel time and travel time reliability. However, Studies on the preferences of public transit commuters, which are useful for assessments of public transport systems, are relatively sparse.====This study evaluates the travel preferences of public transit commuters in Singapore using a large dataset of smart transit card transactions.==== We examine the mode choices of public transit commuters between buses and rails and estimate the implied value of travel time (VOT) and value of reliability (VOR) by type of traveler. We address key issues regarding urban transit commuters’ preferences, which have been neglected in the urban economic literature.====First, based on a high-frequency dataset on the travel activities of approximately four million cardholders over a one-month period, we derive detailed measures of service attributes that influence commuters’ travel behavior, which include travel time, travel time reliability, and travel cost. Previous travel demand studies have mainly focused on the trade-off between travel time and cost but neglect the importance of travel time reliability in the mobility choices of commuters (Carrion and Levinson, 2012). Transport models that omit travel time reliability could bias the estimates of the travel time and cost effects, and policies designed without considering service reliability could possibly be misguided (Bhat and Sardesai, 2006). The big data needed to measure service reliability are not easily and readily available for research purposes. Researchers often resort to collecting self-reported responses via surveys and use these responses to infer commuters’ preferences for reliability and other trip attributes (Calfee and Windston, 1998; Bates et al., 2001; Yan, 2002; Asensio and Matas 2008). The validity of survey responses has been challenged repeatedly due to discrepancies between stated preferences in hypothetical situations and the actual choices made by the sample households. Other studies use the preferences revealed in motorists’ choices of toll lanes from loop detector data (Lam and Small, 2001) or floating car data (Small et al., 2005, 2006) to derive travel time and reliability measures. We use detailed trip-level information from the smart transit card data to compute comprehensive measures of travel time, travel reliability, and travel cost for rail transit and buses at different times of the day and for different origin-destination (OD) pairs.====Second, individual heterogeneity plays an important role in transport modeling. Other than the observed socioeconomic characteristics of individuals, we use fixed effects for a large sample of commuters in the model to control for unobservable heterogeneity, such as travel attitudes, income, health, and lifestyle preferences. Third, we address potential endogeneity between individual mode choices and service-level variation by testing commuters’ behavioral responses to rainfall shocks via changes in service attributes.====Last, studies examining the revealed mode choice between public transport and private cars do not account for utility differences in transit time for public transit riders when computing VOT. However, given that private cars and public transport are two distinct and segmented markets, the omission of transit time could underestimate public transit riders’ preferences in these studies. Due to land scarcity, Singapore's government has adopted a vehicle quota system to regulate the car population. The government curtails private car ownership by imposing high taxes that increase car prices 5 to 6 times above market values.==== The car ownership rate of 100 cars per 1000 people in Singapore is relatively low compared to other countries with a similar income level; for example, there are 838 cars per 1000 people in the US. However, public transit fares are kept at a low level to encourage more people to substitute cars with public transport. Public transportation constitutes approximately 63% of trips taken by residents of Singapore during the rush hour, based on the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) estimates. Therefore, Singapore's transit-dominated environment provides an ideal setup to investigate the travel preferences of public transit commuters.====Using the smart transit card data, we find significant variations in public transport mode choices across different groups of riders. Increases in travel time and travel cost reduce the probability of choosing an urban transit mode for a journey. Unreliable travel time has a significant negative impact on the transport mode choices of adult riders, who switch frequently between different public transportation modes, but the impact on other passengers is insignificant. After adjusting travel time unreliability for longer trips, the mode choices of all transit commuters except for senior citizens are highly sensitive to travel service reliability. We find that public transport riders are highly sensitive to service reliability for work-related journeys. This implies that the preference for service reliability is dependent on the purpose of the trip.====Small and Yan (2001) demonstrate that accounting for heterogeneity in VOT is important in evaluating policies to improve the efficiency of urban transport systems. We show that the VOT and VOR of adult transit riders are higher than those of other groups of transit commuters, such as senior citizens, students and children. On average, the VOT of adult commuters is estimated at approximately S$2/hour, or the equivalent of approximately 15% to 16% of their hourly wage, which falls below the lower end of the 20%−100% range of the gross wage rate estimated for motorists in other industrialized cities (Small, 1992). The VOR of adult commuters is estimated to be S$0.47/hour when measured with the standard deviation of travel time, or the equivalent of 23% of their VOT; when measured with the 50th to 90th percentile travel time range, the VOR is estimated to be S$0.29/hour, or 14% of their VOT.====We find significant variations in VOT and VOR within the adult rider group. Adult commuters who frequently switch their travel modes have relatively higher values of travel time, reliability and the reliability ratio (VOR/VOT) compared to the average adult commuter. The VOT of the frequent mode-switchers ranges from approximately S$3.63/hour to S$4.58/hour, or the equivalent of approximately 24.6% to 34.8% of their median hourly wage; the VOR is approximately 111.9% (with reference to the standard deviation of travel time) and 40.8% (with reference to the travel time in the 50th to 90th percentile range) relative to the VOT. These results imply that the willingness-to-pay for travel time and reliability of public transport riders are significantly lower than those of motorists.====We find significant variation in the demand elasticity across different commuter groups. More specifically, the bus travel time elasticity of the bus share is approximately −1.46 for adult commuters, compared to −0.70 and −0.79 for senior citizens and students/children, respectively. The bus fare (transport cost) elasticity of the bus share is approximately −1.52 for adult commuters, compared to −2.41 for senior citizens. The bus reliability elasticity of the bus share is 0.22 for the frequent mode-switching adult commuters, but the impact is minimal on other commuters. Our results withstood a series of robustness checks. We test for potential endogeneity by using rainfall as an exogenous shock in the mode choice models and find that expected increases in bus travel time reduce bus demand, especially for short distance trips on days of heavy rainfall. These results are consistent with our elasticity estimates.====Our study has significant implications for policymakers in formulating policies that improve efficiency in public transport systems. Using a novel dataset on smart transit card transactions, we are among the first, as far as we are aware, to provide estimates of VOT and VOR for transit commuters, and these estimates are significantly lower than the estimates for motorists reported in the literature. Understanding the VOT and VOR of transit commuters could help transit authorities to adjust transit services to better promote public transport usage. They could use this information to assess how new transit projects could reduce travel time and improve service reliability for commuters. They could design a more cost-effective fare structure by taking into consideration behavioral responses to travel costs among commuters.====The heterogeneity in travel preferences across different commuter groups implies that the “====” style of public transport services does not cater to the varying preferences of transit commuters. Public transport policies targeting travel time and service reliability improvements have a direct impact on adult commuters in their work-related journeys, whereas fare-based transit policies that offer fare discounts will appeal more to cost-sensitive senior citizen commuters. There are benefits to providing more tailored and flexible services, such as on-demand public transit services and surge pricing, to meet the needs of different passenger types, trip origins, trip destinations, etc. For example, one option would be to offer high-price and high-quality transit services to riders with a high willingness to pay for VOT and VOR while keeping affordable regular services for low VOT and VOR riders.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Both, levels of urbanization and development are lower in regions that exhibit a high malaria transmission potential. Evidence further indicates that the settlement behavior of the European colonizers plays an important role in explaining why urban areas are concentrated in low risk areas. Throughout, we rely on an exclusively climate-based measure of malaria falciparum transmission intensity that is independent of local prevalence rates for identification. Robustness of estimates to inclusion of climatic suitability indices for further tropical diseases, null results in placebo tests and reproduction of findings outside of Africa support the validity of our identification strategy.","Plasmodium falciparum malaria has for millennia posed a risk to health in Sub-Saharan Africa (Loy et al., 2017).==== In this study, we assess to what extent differences in the local climatic potential for Plasmodium falciparum malaria have generated within-country disparities in urbanization and economic development. To identify effects, we construct a measure of the local climatic malaria transmission potential that is specifically tailored to the Plasmodium falciparum parasite and is exogenous with respect to local socioeconomic conditions. This measure is based on a biological model that describes mosquito and parasite development as non-monotonic functions of air temperature. Parametrization exclusively relies on experimental data obtained from laboratory studies (Mordecai et al., 2013). The resulting measure captures the local, time-invariant climatic suitability for malaria falciparum transmission. It is best be interpreted as a locational fundamental akin to other geographical features.==== This first nature characteristic not only influences current-day outcomes via direct effects on contemporaneous health, but also through its health-related effects in the past that influenced long-term determinants of economic development. The latter may include culture, institutions or locational choices of where to establish settlements. When interpreting results, it is important to keep in mind that they represent reduced-form effects, i.e., the net effect of all channels through which the malaria intensity measure affects outcomes.====To our knowledge, we are the first to use an exogenous measure for malaria transmission suitability to analyze its effect on current-day urbanization and development. Studies that investigate related questions typically employ malaria-intensity indices that are (partly) based on observed prevalence. These measures are unsuited for the purposes of our analysis due to potential endogeneity. For illustration, take an uninhabited (and undeveloped) area. In this region the malaria prevalence is zero, even when the climatic potential for malaria transmission is very high. However, the area may be deserted precisely owing to the potentially detrimental effect of malaria. Conversely, a higher level of economic development implies that more resources are available to control malaria, thus reducing the number of infections. Due to the existence of these types of reverse causality, the use of a prevalence-based malaria measure would (likely) bias our estimates. Similarly, the widely used global malaria stability index developed in Kiszewski et al. (2004) is potentially endogenous as it depends on the actual distribution of vectors and the observed human biting rates of mosquitos. Both these aspects can be influenced by human economic activity (see e.g., Killeen, McKenzie, Foy, Bøgh, Beier, 2001, Seyoum, Balcha, Balkew, Ali, Gebre-Michael, 2002, Guerra, Snow, Hay, 2006, Ngwa, 2006, Vittor, Gilman, Tielsch, Glass, Shields, Lozano, Pinedo-Cancino, Patz, 2006, Smith, Ruktanonchai, 2010, Mutuku, King, Mungai, Mbogo, Mwangangi, Muchiri, Walker, Kitron, 2011).====In addition to introducing an exogenous climatic measure for Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission intensity, our paper makes two main contributions to the economic literature. First, we systematically document that the malaria environment constitutes a determinant of today’s spatial distribution of urbanization and economic activity in Sub-Saharan Africa. To this end, we divide Sub-Saharan Africa into 5841 grid cells of 0.5  ×  0.5====. For each cell we determine the local degree of malaria suitability and then assess its effect on urbanization and economic activity using a cross-sectional OLS regression approach. Throughout, we control for temperature, a variety of additional exogenous physical characteristics as well as country fixed effects. Consequently, we identify effects of the malaria environment by exploiting the residual within-country variation between the non-monotonic, malaria-falciparum-specific function of air temperature and generic—malaria-unrelated—temperature effects. The resulting estimates show that the local climatic malaria potential strongly deters urbanization. Urban population decreases by 0.117 standard deviations when moving from a region characterized by an average malaria transmission suitability to an area in which the malaria potential is one-standard deviation higher. This translates into a reduction of 31,678 individuals. The deterrent effect on economic activity, proxied by night-time light intensity, is similar in magnitude.====As a second contribution, we show that the local malaria potential also influences the spatial distribution of socioeconomic development. For this part of the analysis, we draw on nationally representative cross-sectional survey data collected in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program. Our sample covers 28 countries and encompasses 522,538 individuals aged 15–49 who reside in 287,858 distinct households. Using this data, we document that persons living in areas with a high climatic malaria transmission suitability accumulate less human capital (measured by educational attainment), are less likely to be employed in the more productive non-agricultural sectors, and accumulate less wealth. Again, the implied magnitude of the point estimates is economically meaningful. Household wealth, for example, decreases by 16 percent (evaluated at the sample mean) when the malaria potential increases by one standard deviation.====Taken together, our results document that the climatic malaria transmission potential constitutes a locational fundamental that deters socioeconomic development and urbanization. In the final step of our analysis, we investigate the relevance of one potential channel that links the malaria environment to urbanization: the locational choices of the European colonizers. Specifically, we show that European economic centers were less likely to emerge in high malaria risk regions. Many of these centers have since evolved into large cities. This, in turn, helps explain why today’s spatial distribution of urbanization is influenced by the local malaria environment.====The key identifying assumption underlying our analysis is that malaria suitability index specifically captures the climatic malaria transmission potential rather than some generic effect of temperature. We support the validity of this assumption by exploiting the fact that the penetration of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in Latin America varied over time and space (Webb (2008, p. 73, p. 85 ff.)). We show that variation in the malaria transmission potential does not predict urbanization or development in regions where the parasite was absent. In areas with a stable presence of the parasite, on the other hand, the malaria environment constitutes a locational fundamental that strongly deters these two outcomes. Further evidence for the malaria-specificity of our results is provided by the fact that our estimates remain stable when we control for temperature suitability indices developed for alternative tropical diseases, including Yellow and Dengue fever as well as Animal Trypanosomiasis. To document the stability of our estimates more generally, we conduct a battery of robustness checks. These include extending the set of control variables, employing alternative measures for urbanization, modifying the malaria suitability index, and using different standard error clustering approaches.====Our paper is related to different strands of literatures. An influential body of work looks at the relationship between the malaria environment and current-day economic development. Several cross-country studies document negative correlations (e.g., Gallup, Sachs, Mellinger, 1999, Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001, Gallup, Sachs, 2001). A number of papers that use sub-national data to identify determinants of economic development also takes into account measures of malaria exposure (e.g., Henderson, Storeygard, Weil, 2012, Michalopoulos, Papaioannou, 2013, Michalopoulos, Papaioannou, 2014, Alsan, 2015, Henderson, Squires, Storeygard, Weil, 2018). While the majority of these studies find a negative relationship between malaria and current-day development outcomes, the point estimates are potentially biased due to the use of prevalence-based malaria intensity indices. Furthermore, no study specifically focuses on assessing the effect of the malaria environment on the spatial distribution of development. Rather, the malaria index is treated as a control variable and its impact is not discussed in detail.====Linked to our investigation are further papers that analyze the effects of the malaria environment on development in Sub-Saharan Africa during the pre-colonial period (Depetris-Chauvin, Weil, 2018, Easterly, Levine, 2016). For this earlier period, the studies do not find any negative effects. This implies that the negative relationship only emerged during the 20th century, i.e., the colonial and post-colonial era. We provide additional empirical support for this view and suggest the malaria-influenced settlement pattern of the European colonizers as a possible explanation for the emergence of the negative effect. In this regard, our results also connect to the discussion about the effects of European colonial activity on current-day economic development (e.g., Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001, Putterman, Weil, 2010, Easterly, Levine, 2016, Ali, Fjeldstad, Jiang, Shifa, 2018) as well as the papers that document a strong degree of persistence in the spatial distribution of urbanization (e.g., Redding, Sturm, Wolf, 2010, Michaels, Rauch, 2018, Jedwab, Kerby, Moradi, 2017, Jedwab, Moradi, 2016).====By identifying the malaria environment as an important locational fundamental, our study also speaks to the literature that analyzes the effect of geography on urbanization (e.g., Davis, Weinstein, 2002, Rappaport, Sachs, 2003, Bosker, Brakman, Garretsen, Schramm, 2007, Rosenthal, Strange, 2008, Saiz, 2010, Miguel, Roland, 2011, Motamed, Florax, Masters, 2014, Henderson, Storeygard, Deichmann, 2017, Henderson, Squires, Storeygard, Weil, 2018) or economic development (e.g., Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2003, Rappaport, Sachs, 2003, Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2005, Dell, 2010, Dell, Jones, Olken, 2012, Nunn, Puga, 2012, Alsan, 2015, Flückiger, Ludwig, 2017).====Finally, this paper connects to the large body of research that analyzes the effects of malaria on individual-level outcomes (e.g., Bleakley, 2010, Cutler, Fung, Kremer, Singhal, Vogl, 2010, Lucas, 2010, Lucas, 2013). These studies generally investigate the effects of malaria eradication campaigns on proximate determinants of development, contemporaneous health in particular. Our estimates, on the other hand, capture variation in socioeconomic outcomes that are caused by differences in the local, climatically determined, potential for malaria transmission. Apart from exerting a direct effect on contemporaneous health this locational characteristic can affect economic well-being via its influence on the evolution of more fundamental determinants of development, such as local institutions or culture. Crucially, malaria-induced differences in these deep fundamentals persist even if malaria is eradicated. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In the next section, we introduce our measure of climatic malaria transmission suitability in detail and outline the methodology employed in the empirical analysis. In Section 3, we present the data along with a descriptive analysis thereof. The regression results are discussed in Section 4, after which potential channels are investigated. We conclude with Section 6.","Malaria suitability, urbanization and subnational development in sub-Saharan Africa",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300504,28 September 2020,2020,Research Article,92.0

We analyze anonymized mobile phone data to examine how distance and population density affect calling behavior. Exploiting an exogenous change in ==== as well as permanent relocations of individuals, we find that distance is highly detrimental to link formation. Mobile phone usage significantly increases with population density even when spatial sorting is accounted for. This effect is most pronounced for local interactions between individuals in the same catchment area. This indicates that face-to-face interactions and mobile phone calls are complementary to each other, so that mobile phone technology may even increase the dividends of density.","Social interactions are pivotal for the diffusion of information and they directly contribute to well-being. A central feature in many models of urban economics is that a dense concentration facilitates social interactions and thereby benefits learning and productivity (for an overview see Duranton and Puga, 2004). These models build on the common assumption that distance induces costs to interpersonal exchange. The widespread adoption of information and telecommunication technologies popularized the “death-of-distance” hypothesis (e.g. Cairncross, 2001), which raises the question of whether these technologies will change the structure of cities (see Ioannides et al., 2008) or even make them obsolete. As argued by Gaspar and Glaeser (1998), the impact of mobile telecommunication technologies on the role of cities crucially depends on whether face-to-face meetings and phone calls act as ==== or ==== to each other – in the latter case, mobile phone technology may even increase the dividends of density.====This paper presents evidence that allows to assess whether face-to-face meetings and social interactions via mobile phones are complements or substitutes. We estimate the effects of distance and population density on the phone usage of individuals at different locations. Our analysis builds on anonymized call detail records ==== which combine information about communication patterns and place of residence. The dataset covers millions of calls and text messages over a period of 12 months and allows us to address three sets of questions: ==== how does the travel distance between two agents affect the likelihood that they interact via their mobile phones? ==== how does population density affect the phone usage of agents measured via call frequency, call duration, and number of unique contacts? ====, does density affect the pattern of ==== phone calls, that is those calls within the caller’s catchment area? The absence of significant distance costs and a negative impact of density on phone usage may be interpreted as supportive evidence for the “death-of -distance” hypothesis and the idea that urban centers lose ground as hubs for social exchange. Contrary, a penalty on distance, a higher phone usage and more local calls in cities would point towards a complementarity between the two modes of communication and hence contradict the hypothesis that modern telecommunication undermines agglomeration forces that operate via social interactions.====Systematic sorting complicates the analysis of our three guiding questions. Individuals with similar (unobservable) characteristics potentially cluster in space and are more likely to interact with each other. Moreover, preferences for density and phone usage may be correlated. To address these endogeneity concerns, we use individuals who permanently relocate (referred to as movers) to back out time-constant unobservables and identify density-related effects. This identification strategy relates to approaches quantifying the earning advantages of cities (e.g. Combes et al., 2008). As movers may share characteristics that differ systematically from the average, we discuss heterogeneity of the effects and compare the results for movers to those identified for stayers exploiting the plausibly exogenous revision of public transport schedules. This revision changed the effective distance between individuals and allows us to compare the calling behavior of individuals before and after the public transport timetable was updated.====Several studies examine the use of communication technology from a spatial perspective. They document an increase in phone usage with city size (see Gaspar, Glaeser, 1998, Charlot, Duranton, 2006, Schläpfer, Bettencourt, Grauwin, Raschke, Claxton, Smoreda, West, Ratti, 2014) or illustrate a strong negative correlation between distance and the likelihood for an exchange via email and Facebook (e.g. Bailey, Cao, Kuchler, Stroebel, Wong, 2018, Bailey et al., 2020, Levy, Goldenberg, 2014). However, neither of these contributions address non-random sorting.==== We attempt to separate the causal effects of distance and density from sorting by tracing changes in phone usage over time. This strategy allows us to perform a comprehensive set of tests to discriminate between complementarity and substitutability of phone and face-to-face interactions. Density externalities tend to be highly localized (e.g. Arzaghi, Henderson, 2008, Shoag, Veuger, 2018). CDRs are especially suitable to study such effects due to their fine-grained spatial resolution. They have been used in recent research, for instance, to analyze correlations between calling patterns and regional economic development (Eagle et al., 2010) to study solidarity in the context of natural disasters (Blumenstock et al., 2016) or to examine the role of referrals in labor markets (Barwick et al., 2019).====We demonstrate that social interactions via phones are markedly localized, with the distance-elasticity of link formation falling quickly and converging to zero at about 100 minutes travel distance. How do these distance related costs affect phone usage at locations of different population density? We show that the overall intensity of phone interactions measured by call frequency and duration increases with population density, while the number of unique contacts remains unaffected when we account for sorting. The impact of density is even more pronounced for local interactions, as individuals in cities display a higher number of unique contacts within their neighborhood, and call those nearby more frequently and for a longer duration than individuals living in sparsely populated areas. The elasticities of local interactions in terms of frequency, duration, and unique number of contacts with regard to population density ranges between 0.1 and 0.4. These findings remain robust when we account for unobservable place characteristics by instrumenting population density, when we include text messages or when we examine different subsamples of the population. Our results support the hypothesis that mobile phone calls complement (not substitute) face-to-face interactions.",Cities and the structure of social interactions: Evidence from mobile phone data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300474,20 August 2020,2020,Research Article,93.0

In Kampala, Uganda, four systems of land tenure coexist, allowing a detailed study of the effects of these on household and firm location decisions. Spatially disaggregated data across the city suggest that the presence of a traditional land tenure system (called mailo) skews land-use towards informal housing and away from business and commercial activities. Using a structural model of the city we show that this due to mailo having a positive value for its occupants, attributable to mailo-specific amenity benefits and/ or rent caps. We use the model to investigate the effect of converting all mailo land in the city to leasehold. Despite direct loss of amenity experienced by mailo residents, aggregate city income may rise substantially because of more efficient land-use. Manufacturing firms move into formerly mailo areas and form new clusters of activity. This increases urban wages, particularly among the low skilled, and raises aggregate urban real incomes by 2% in the absence of localisation economies and as much as 6.7% in the presence of such ====.","Lack of clarity surrounding land titles, and the consequent rights to occupy and to build on land, is frequently cited as a major contributing factor to poor housing conditions, lack of investment, and low productivity in many developing cities (e.g. Brueckner and Lall, 2015). Unclear land rights prevent the efficient allocation and development of land, a city's ultimate scarce factor. As a result, land-use in many developing cities appears haphazard, with one-storey traditional dwellings occupying prime land that might be more efficiently used by businesses or modern higher-rise buildings. Low-rise residential areas are often slums, in which more than 60% of Africa's urban population is housed (Marx et al., 2013). As well as preventing development of these areas, lack of clarity can generate land-use patterns that limit the connectivity between firms and workers and stifle the development of clusters of firms needed to support high productivity.====This paper is a study of the impact of land tenure systems on patterns of land-use in Kampala, Uganda, investigating the extent to which land tenure patterns shape the location of economic activity in the city and hence have consequences for real incomes. The paper shows three main things. First, that there is a strong positive correlation between the presence of a traditional land tenure system (the ‘mailo’ system) and the location of informal housing within the city, as well as negative links between mailo land and economic activity. Second, using a structural model to control for other factors that could be driving this correlation, we argue that this is a causal effect, with mailo providing amenity to tenants through a combination of below market price land and social or network benefits. Third, we use the structural model to show that there are substantial efficiency gains to be made through land tenure reform in the city.====The overall development of Kampala appears typical of a number of East African cities. Its population has grown rapidly, from 775,000 in 1990 to around 1.5 million in 2014 and predicted to more than double again by 2030. These high rates of urban population growth have led to a sprawling, low density city, with the wider urban area, the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA), estimated to be home to 4 million people. Buildings are often shacks or at best one or two storey traditional structures, with more than 60% of the city resident in these informal structures (locally termed muzigos). These are spread over a large area, with poor travel conditions across town due to congested low-quality roads and the lack of a public transit system; the Ministry of Works and Transport estimates that 40% of rush hour journey times within the city during are spent at standstill. With such a dispersed and disconnected urban population firms struggle to reap the potential benefits of the city and locate instead near their consumer and labour markets, spreading out throughout the urban area. Many of these are small firms, specialising in providing consumer services, with manufacturing employment representing just 10% of urban jobs.====Kampala has a unique history with regards to its land tenure system, with four different land tenure types simultaneously present in the urban area. In 1900, the British Government and the Buganda Kingdom, the historic rulers of the region in which Kampala lies, divided the land in the area between them, with part of the city remaining under a traditional land tenure system, mailo, and part being transferred to leasehold or freehold tenure.==== Over time, these contrasting land tenure systems have shaped the patterns of urban growth of the city. Under freehold and leasehold tenures land is transferable and can be sold or leased to the highest bidder relatively easily. Under customary tenure, which has developed on formerly public or private land, established groups of settled households have acquired rights to that land over time, although lack of official documentation limits the exchangeability of the land. Under mailo, the traditional land tenure system, both the land-owner (private owners or the Buganda kingdom) and the tenant have claims to the land, making the sale or transfer of land difficult as permission must be sought from more than one party. Tenants who have been on mailo land for at least 12 years cannot be evicted if they pay a minimum annual ground rent, generally well below what would be the market rent. As a result urban development on mailo land is particularly difficult, and the areas that are mailo are essentially those set in 1900. The dual-ownership system impedes sale and purchase, particularly as tenants – who can block land transfer – may have below market rents. Simultaneously, a lack of paper records creates an eviction risk for mailo tenants, limiting their incentives to invest in structures on the land they occupy. Together, these factors are likely to provide obstacles to developing land, even that in prime locations, into high value uses.====We analyse the ways in which the land tenure systems influence the patterns of economic activity through three stages. First, in Section 2 we explore how the location of different types of economic activity correlates with the tenure system. This shows that employment, particularly in business services, is less intense on mailo and customary lands, whereas households resident in informal muzigo housing are more densely located in these areas. These differences are suggestive that land tenure systems have an influence on the patterns of activity within the city, and as a result, on the city's output and the residents’ well-being. However, correlations between mailo land and employment and population densities could be capturing patterns that result from other features of the city. For example, mailo land may be poorly located, in which case the tenure system may not be the main cause of the observed land-use. We control for this in two ways. One is using observable information about the land, such as elevation and ruggedness, and the location relative to amenities such as schools, hospitals and roads. We find that the correlations still remain strong. The other is to control for the economic geography of the current city, including factors such as connectivity to economically dynamic areas of the city. We do this by developing a complete model of the city and looking at deviations from patterns of land-use predicted by the model.====To examine this, in Section 3 we develop a spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE) model of a city. This model is in the tradition of new economic geography and its quantitative application as developed by Ahlfeldt et al. (2015). The development of this literature is reviewed by Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017), who describe the menu of features that can be captured in such models. Features of the model developed in the present paper include a fine level of spatial disaggregation, with the city divided into 96 distinct geographical areas, each with a fixed land area and connected to others through a transport network. Travel times around this network determine the costs of moving goods and services, costs of commuting, and the spatial range of productivity spillovers. Firms in different sectors choose where and how much to produce, using a technology that involves input–output linkages and (in some of our experiments) productivity spillovers. Households choose where to live, where to work, what sort of housing to occupy, and what to consume depending on rents, access to jobs, and commuting costs and the prices of goods and services.====Our model is innovative in that it includes developing-country features designed to capture both formal and informal employment and housing. Thus, firms differ across sectors (manufacturing, business services, and consumer services) and we separate out one-person firms. Each of these enterprise types varies by their input mix (including land-use), goods and services produced, and by the tradability of their output. This sectoral heterogeneity is essential to capture the varying patterns of land-use that we observe across the city, and in particular informal sector employment. Nearly one quarter of employment in Kampala is in one-person enterprises, typically producing goods traded only within the city or neighbourhood.====We distinguish between high and low-skilled households and also between formal and informal sector (muzigo) housing. Decisions on which type of housing is built in each place are endogenous, and so too is the density of housing constructed. In the formal sector housing can deliver density by building tall (at increasing unit cost) while in the informal sector density is achieved by ‘crowding’ which decreases the quality and value of the housing offered (see also Henderson et al., 2019 for models of formal and informal housing). At equilibrium, the labour, goods, services, land and housing markets all clear, producing a set of endogenous wages, prices and rents for every location in the city, as well as the numbers and types of people and firms who locate in different neighbourhoods. The ensuing pattern of land-use is the focus of our attention.====In Section 4 we introduce the data used to apply this model to Kampala and calibrate the model so that the equilibrium pattern of household and firm location exactly matches the patterns observed. Kampala is unusual in having highly spatially disaggregated data on firms and households which allow us to analyse how the tenure systems shape the location of different types of residential and commercial activity. The population census provides household numbers by skill level and housing type in each of the 96 parishes in the city, and a census of business establishments provides employment numbers by sector and establishment size in the same set of locations. The calibration produces a set of location specific productivity and amenity parameters which account for the location decisions of firms and workers, over and above those factors captured in the model. For example, if there is a higher density of manufacturing employment in a particular location in the data than that suggested by the model, then the manufacturing productivity parameter for this location is relatively large, representing some unobserved factors that make manufacturing employment in this area more attractive.====The calibrated productivity and amenity parameters capture variations in the urban landscape not otherwise captured in the model. Since land tenure is not explicitly modelled, its effects are included in these parameters.==== In Section 5 we recover the effect of different land tenure systems by regressing these parameters on, amongst other things, the share of land in different parishes under each type of tenure. Areas with high shares of mailo land have significantly higher amenity parameters for those living in informal housing, although not significantly lower productivity parameters. This indicates that the low densities of employment in mailo areas are attributable not to low productivities in these areas, but to residential use ‘crowding-out’ firms. We also control for geographical features of the city, including elevation and ruggedness of the land, as well as access to schools, hospitals and roads. The positive relationship between mailo land and the amenity parameters remains strong. This could be signalling two things: either that these areas provide amenity benefits such as dense community networks and other social benefits, or that rent caps create financial benefits. Without rent data we cannot distinguish the two any further, however the literature provides some evidence that rent caps are a feature of mailo land.====It is important to note what data is, and is ==== available for Kampala. We are restricted to work with a single population census (2002), that for 2012 having not been released because of reservations about its accuracy. There are two business establishment censuses, but that for 2011 (which we use) is deemed considerably more reliable than that for 2002. There is little reliable rent data, and none that covers areas of traditional tenure systems and would enable a direct comparison of rents or land values in different parishes. The absence of times-series variation and rent data means that we place heavy dependence on the structural model. Estimates of some parameters, including some key elasticities, come from elsewhere in the economic literature, and are not structurally estimated.====Finally, in Section 6, we use the calibrated model to illustrate and quantify possible effects of replacing mailo land tenure in the city with the more modern leasehold tenure system. We simulate an experiment in which all the mailo land in the city is converted to leasehold, using the predicted productivity and amenity parameters derived from regressing calibrated productivity and amenity on tenure type. The change reduces the amenity benefits of these areas to informal households; this may be direct amenity value (for example loss of social or economic networks) or benefit derived from a rent-cap. We calculate real income effects in both cases; the former is a real cost, whereas the latter is a transfer, with tenants losing and land-owners gaining. In addition to these direct effects, there is a change in the equilibrium pattern of land-use, as households and firms adjust their locations in the city. The reduction in demand for muzigo housing in areas that were previously mailo allows other households and firms to move in. The consequence is a large spatial redistribution of activity in the city. The relatively land-intensive manufacturing sector benefits the most, moving into areas that have become cheaper, forming new clusters and expanding production. This boosts the wages of the low-skilled, some of whom move out of jobs in consumer services and small firms and into manufacturing. The net effect is a more efficient spatial organisation of the city, increasing aggregate welfare by 2.0–6.7% depending on whether or not additional scale economies are present. These gains are equivalent to 24% of average rent per directly affected household (households on mailo land) under no scale economies, rising to 80% with returns to scale of 6%. Capitalising this flow benefit (at 5% discount rate) the value of the reform ranges from 4 times average city rent to 16 times average city rent per directly affected household.","Land tenure and land-use in a developing city: A quantitative spatial model applied to Kampala, Uganda",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300395,23 June 2020,2020,Research Article,94.0

This surge in second home investments has triggered a serious political backlash in many countries.====In this paper, we explore the local housing and labor market impacts of one form of such political backlash: ====. While in most countries far fewer people live and work in seasonal tourist locations than in superstar cities, when it comes to analyzing the market for second homes, the former locations are arguably economically at least as important as the latter.====Seasonal tourist locations rich in natural amenities differ from high-productivity superstar cities in two important respects that are relevant for both, our theoretical and empirical analysis. First, unlike in superstar cities, in seasonal tourist locations, the tourist sector is typically the dominant industry. Second, while in superstar cities primary and second homes tend to be close substitutes, in seasonal tourist locations this is usually not the case. For example, holiday homes at the beach often do not possess heating required for the winter season and wooden chalets in the mountains are in specific micro-locations, typically near ski lifts, and are of a style that is not suitable for year-round living.====To shed light on the mechanisms through which a constraint on second homes in seasonal tourist locations may affect local housing and labor markets, we develop a simple dynamic general equilibrium framework, where bans on second home investments have two opposing effects. They adversely affect local labor markets (negative ‘local economy effect’) but positively influence the primary residents’ valuation of local amenities (positive ‘local amenity effect’).====We consider two alternative theoretical settings. The first assumes that primary and second homes are poor substitutes and therefore trade in separate markets. The model with this setting yields three empirically testable predictions. Constraining second home construction (i) negatively impacts the price of primary homes, (ii) adversely affects local labor markets, and (iii) increases the price growth of second homes in the constrained areas.====In contrast, the second setting assumes that the two types of homes are perfect substitutes. In this case, the price of existing primary and second homes must move in the same direction. Whether the direction is positive or negative is theoretically ambiguous.====To empirically identify the local housing and labor market impacts of constraining the construction of new second homes, we exploit a unique quasi-natural experiment in Switzerland – the ‘Second Home Initiative’ (SHI). Voters narrowly approved this popular initiative in March 2012 and effectively banned the construction of new second homes in municipalities with a share of such homes of 20% or more.====Our empirical analysis builds on a standard difference-in-differences (DD) setting and addresses concerns of omitted variable bias and out-of-treatment selection by first-differencing the DD-equation and instrumenting the observed treatment assignment. Our preferred estimates suggest that the SHI-ban lowered price growth of primary homes in affected areas by 15%, increased the growth in local unemployment rates by 12%, and increased price growth of second homes by 26%. Our empirical findings for Switzerland are thus consistent with a theoretical setting where primary and second homes are poor substitutes.====Overall, our empirical findings imply that the adverse local labor market effects dominated any anticipated positive landscape preservation effects. In fact, we do not observe any significant positive sorting response from residents to the alleged benefits of the ban. Our results suggest that in seasonal tourist locations, like in Switzerland, where primary and second homes are not close substitutes, bans on the construction of second homes may reinforce rather than reduce wealth inequality.====Our paper relates to a relatively small but growing recent literature that focuses on the role played by residential real estate investors in housing markets. Haughwout et al. (2011) investigate the role of investors during the Great Financial Crisis in the United States, documenting that investors were heavily overrepresented in states that experienced the largest housing booms and busts. In a related study, Chinco and Mayer (2016) compare local second homebuyers to out-of-town investors. They find that out-of-town buyers – unlike local second homebuyers – behave as misinformed speculators, increasing future house prices and the implied-to-actual rent ratio. Finally, Bayer et al. (2020) classify investors into two categories according to their observed investment strategies: middlemen and speculators. The former group aims to make profit by buying from motivated sellers at prices below the market value and re-selling quickly, whereas the latter group times their investments to markets displaying strong price increases. By excluding the possibility that speculators possess superior information on housing price dynamics, they indirectly establish a causal link between speculative behavior and housing price bubbles.====A number of recent papers focus on international second home investments in superstar cities. Cvijanovic and Spaenjers (2020) explore the effect of international demand for luxury secondary residences in Paris. They point out how investors concentrate in specific areas, thereby increasing local housing prices. In line with Chinco and Mayer (2016), they find that foreign investors realize lower capital gains compared to local ones. Badarinza and Ramadorai (2018) focus on London and document how foreign real estate investors possess a “home bias abroad”. They invest in areas displaying high shares of residents of the same country thus affecting housing prices and transaction volumes. In a similar vein, Sá (2016) finds that the volume-share of residential real estate investments in England and Wales performed by overseas companies increases house prices and decreases homeownership rates. Suher (2016) explores the response of non-resident owners of second homes in New York City to targeted annual property taxes. Using the city's 2013 change in the property tax treatment of condominiums, he documents that non-resident buyers have a significant impact on house prices within a subset of highly desirable neighborhoods, but no impact outside of these areas. Finally, Favilukis and Van Nieuwerburgh (2017) develop and calibrate a spatial equilibrium model for the New York and Vancouver metro areas to investigate the welfare effects of out-of-town homebuyers. Their findings suggest that higher levels of out-of-town buyers are associated with higher house prices and lower welfare. However, taxing purchases made by foreign investors may lead to welfare gains to the extent fiscal revenues are used to finance local public goods.====Studies on the economic impacts of restrictions on non-resident buyers are still rare and have so far focused on China. Somerville et al. (2020) document that purchase restrictions in China significantly reduced the housing transaction volume in restricted areas in the short run but that these effects diminished over time. Interestingly, they do not find any differential price effects between restricted and unrestricted areas. The underlying mechanisms that drive these results are quite different, however, from those proposed in this paper. This is because the institutional settings differ starkly. In China, unlike in Switzerland or other Western countries, land supply is determined by government-controlled land auctions.====Overall, the literature appears to support the widespread concern that non-resident investors into residential real estate increase local house prices and fuel market instability. This gives potential legitimacy to policies that aim to constrain non-resident real estate investments, either by imposing higher local taxes on non-primary owners or by constraining the quantity of such investments. To date, however, we know little about the economic effects of such investment constraints on local housing and labor market outcomes, and on the location decisions of primary residents, especially in Western advanced economies. This paper aims to fill this gap. In particular, our analysis considers mid- and long-term investors and does not exclusively focus on short-term speculators. The latter do not fully capture the significance of the global second home investment phenomenon.====The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the institutional setting and the specifics of the SHI. In Section 3 we present the model and derive predictions for the empirical analysis.

I estimate the effect of receiving a free house under the South African government’s housing program, which has given away over 3 million housing units since 1994. Using four waves of household panel data from Cape Town and ==== on the location of large housing projects, I exploit a natural experiment whereby households living close to projects were first in line to get them to instrument for selection into the programme. I use projects that were planned and approved, but never actually built, to deal with non-random placement of housing projects. Government housing has a significant positive effect on household earnings. This is driven primarily by increases in earnings for women. I present evidence consistent with a mechanism whereby formal housing frees up time by alleviating the demands of work in the home.","Substandard housing conditions are one of the main deprivations suffered by the poor around the world. It is estimated that over 860 million people live in slums in developing countries, and this number has been growing rapidly with increasing rates of urbanisation (UN Habitat, 2003, UN Habitat, 2010). Poor housing is associated with a lack of access to running water, electricity, heating, ventilation, and security of tenure. Policy interventions to improve housing conditions through slum upgrading, land titling and public housing are widespread (Buckley, Kallergis, Wainer, 2016, Michaels, Nigmatulina, Rauch, Regan, Baruah, Dahlstrand-Rudin). Such policies may be partly motivated by the negative externalities caused by slums, but also by the idea that living in slums can have detrimental impacts of the economic lives on residents, and therefore constitute “poverty traps” for those living in them (Marx et al., 2013).====A large literature shows that improvements in home technologies can increase labour supply, especially for women, by freeing up time previously spent in the home (Duflo, 2012, Dinkelman, 2011, Greenwood, Seshadri, Yorukoglu, 2005). In a related way, poor housing could place burdens on the time of residents, limiting their ability to actively participate in labour markets.==== It is plausible to think, therefore, that providing serviced formal housing could improve labour market outcomes, especially for women. However, relatively little research directly links housing conditions and employment outcomes.====The South African government’s large-scale housing program has delivered over 3 million stand-alone housing units free of charge to people living in informal housing conditions over the last 26 years. In this paper, I use longitudinal household data from the city of Cape Town over four waves from 2002 to 2009 to assess the impact of government housing on household labour supply.==== In order to isolate the effect of moving from informal to formal housing I focus on households that live in informal settlements at baseline.====Evidence on the effects of improved housing quality is hard to identify, in part because government housing programs usually combine improved housing conditions with relocation to different (often worse) neighbourhoods. The South African case is no exception. As the program was scaled up and cities grew, government housing has been built increasingly far from the city centre. However, due to the placement of housing projects in this city during the early years of the program when my study is conducted, households in my study moved, on average, only slightly further from their original place of living when they won housing. Furthermore, my identification strategy leverages the proximity of potential beneficiaries to new housing projects. This allows me to isolate the impact of improved formal housing from possibly confounding impacts on of neighbourhood changes or distance from employment, which have been shown to have negative impacts on access to jobs and existing social networks for relocated households (Jacob, 2004, Barnhardt, Field, Pande, 2016, Picarelli, 2019). This is the main contribution of my paper. My results should be seen less as representative of the average effects of government housing programs, including the South African program, but rather as the isolated effect of improved housing alone. Indeed, the South Afircan program has generally moved beneficiary households great distances from the city centre, which has been shown to have deleterious effects (Picarelli, 2019).====Households that receive a government house experience large increases in income, relative to households that do not receive one. My fixed effects OLS estimates show an increase in household earnings of 18% due to improved housing. This increase is driven primarily by increased earnings from employment for female members of treated households.==== Turning to data on earnings for individual earnings, I find modest (and statistically insignificant impact) on total employment among women, but significant increases in salaries for women who were already working before they won a house. These effects on earnings are further concentrated among women who were working part-time at baseline. The results suggest that improved housing lead women to increase their labour supply at the intensive margin. Consistent with this, I find a significant effect on hours worked for a sub-sample of young adults (nearly 50% of my sample) for whom I have data on working hours.==== I do not find the same effects when I replicate my analysis on a sample of households who did not live in informal housing before they received government housing, suggesting that it is housing itself rather than some other effect of winning housing (such as wealth effects) that drive the results.====To improve causal identification, I use the allocation procedure used by local government as a natural experiment: program recipients were selected on the basis of their proximity to government housing developments. I proceed in two steps: first, I use the distance between households’ original place of living and the location of newly built housing projects to instrument for selection into treatment at the household level. Although these IV estimates are less precise, they are larger than the main OLS estimates, suggesting negative selection at the household level, leading to downward bias in the main OLS estimates. Second, I deal with possibly non-random placement of housing developments across different areas by using a set of housing projects that were approved and planned at the same time as completed projects, but cancelled or delayed for reasons unrelated to the communities they were intended to benefit. I then compare only households that were near to completed projects to those near incomplete projects and find quantatively similar effects on income and female earnings.====I discuss a number of mechanisms that could be driving the increase in earnings. I provide suggestive evidence for one key causal mechanism: that poor housing conditions place particular burdens on the time use of women.==== I use evidence from the baseline data, as well as representative time-use surveys from South Africa, to show that women allocate a remarkably large amount of time to housework, preparing food, and care for children and the elderly (Budlender et al., 2001). Consistent with evidence from other developing countries (Berniell and Sánchez-Páramo, 2012), time allocations to work in the home are significantly larger for women living in informal housing. I estimate significant positive treatment effects of government housing on electrification, direct access to running water, and modern home appliances, all of which could be saving significant amounts of time for women. Finally, I conduct exploratory sub-group analysis, which shows that the effects are concentrated among households with a larger number of children, and among individual women who are older than 30 and female heads of households. I argue that the combination of three effects (domestic work in the home, home maintenance, and tenure security) could be jointly responsible for a large proportion of the increases in earnings. Ultimately, however, my data does not allow me to rule out other possible mechanisms.====These results contribute to the literature on the relationship between physical living conditions and female labour supply. Labour saving improvements to the lives of the poor can free up time to work in the labour market (Duflo, 2012, Greenwood, Seshadri, Yorukoglu, 2005, Devoto, Duflo, Dupas, Pariente, Pons, 2011). Dinkelman (2011) shows that electrification of homes increases female labour supply and earnings by freeing up time from work at home in South Africa. Field (2007) shows that improved tenure security, without improving housing quality, frees up time that otherwise would have been spent at home defending the home from expropriation. Few papers have looked at the impacts of slum upgrading or housing programs on labour supply. Keare and Parris (1982) find that provision of tenure and basic services in four countries had positive impacts on employment and income generation.====Second, I contribute to the broader literature on slums as poverty traps. Marx et al. (2013) discuss three channels through which living in a slum could constrain household income and investment: human capital and health effects, policy neglect, and under-investment due to weak property rights. I add a fourth channel to this list by showing that poor housing conditions can constrain labour market participation. While a growing literature looks at the impact of housing on health and well-being (Cattaneo, Galiani, Gertler, Martinez, Titiunik, 2009, Galiani, Gertler, Undurraga, Cooper, Martínez, Ross, 2017), there are relatively few studies showing a link between poor housing and ability to participate in labour markets.====Third, this paper contributes to the evidence on the effects of large scale housing programs. Public housing is often associated with negative economic and social consequences, largely because the evidence on the impacts of housing estates in developed countries has largely been negative (Olsen and Zabel, 2014). Yet large-scale housing projects of this kind are increasingly popular with governments and electorates in the developing world (Gilbert, 2004, Buckley, Kallergis, Wainer, 2016, Franklin, 2019). My study does not estimate the average treatment effect of government housing in South Africa. Due to my estimation strategy, I estimate the effects of improved government housing on households that were previously in slums, while keeping geographic isolation (distance from the city) constant. On the other hand, Picarelli (2019) evaluates the same government program at the national level using a different identification strategy. This study includes households that were already living in formal houses before they received government housing, and so may not experience the same housing-quality shock that households in my study experience. In the post-2009 period, when well-located land was increasingly scarce, she finds that government housing does indeed relocate households further from economic opportunity, which in turn negatively affects female labour supply. The results from Picarelli (2019) can be better thought of the total effect of the policy, for the contemporary period, while the results in this paper isolate the effect of government housing only for households that previously lived in informal settlements and in the absence of the effects of relocation. Recent evidence from India suggests positive human capital and employment effects of government housing, also from a program that did not move households too far from their original locations (Kumar, 2019). Taking these results together underscores the economic benefits of improving housing conditions for the urban poor in developing countries, but suggests that these benefits can be undermined by requiring households to move further from the city, as urban housing programs often do.",Enabled to work: The impact of government housing on slum dwellers in South Africa,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009411902030036X,5 June 2020,2020,Research Article,97.0

Findings suggest excess of about 54,000 loans at the deductibility limit, or 4.5% of the sample. The level of bunching implies an average reduction in borrowing around the $1 million limit of 9.4 percent, and mortgage demand elasticities between − 0.132 to − 0.115 for home purchase loans. Estimated elasticities imply that from 2004-2016 the MID induced $49.52 billion in deadweight loss in the mortgage market.","Housing markets in the United States are subsidized by preferential treatment in the tax code. There are many ways housing is preferred in the federal tax code- from the exclusion of imputed rent to the deductibility of property taxes- but arguably the most visible to consumers over the last 30 years has the mortgage interest deduction (MID). The MID allows for interest paid on a home purchase mortgage to be deducted from taxable income.====It is important to evaluate the MID because it functions as a price-distorting subsidy in housing and mortgage markets. A price distortion may be efficiency enhancing if it subsidizes an activity with positive externalities, such as home ownership, but empirical evidence suggests the MID is unrelated to home ownership.==== The price distortion created by the MID results in a lower price of debt-financed housing, potentially imposing welfare costs on borrowers as they shift toward using debt to purchase a home. In addition, there is an emerging literature suggesting consumers may respond differently to tax (subsidy) induced price differences than price differences caused by market forces, making it important to separately estimate how the MID changes borrowing relative to other sources of interest rate variation. To date, there is no empirical work that produces a causal estimate of the relationship between the MID and U.S. consumer borrowing.====This paper identifies the average effect of the MID on borrower behavior using the budget constraint kink in net-of-tax interest rates created by the $1 million limit on tax deductibility of mortgage interest.==== Using data from a national sample of 2004-2016 mortgages from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), I perform a bunching analysis at the MID limit estimating a counterfactual distribution that accounts for observed bunching at salient loan amounts. By comparing the bunching estimate to a counterfactual estimate of borrowing around the limit, I determine the magnitude of the borrower's behavioral response to the MID. Using marginal tax rates to create a price change at the limit, I estimate elasticities of mortgage borrowing with respect to net-of-tax interest rates. I apply the estimated elasticity to a simple a Harberger model to calculate the deadweight loss induced by the MID for the years of my sample and also simulate the effect of lowering the MID limit on state-level mortgage markets.====I find evidence of substantial bunching at the MID borrowing limit. Estimates that account for salient loan bunching at other $1 million increments and $100k increments in the loan distribution suggest an excess of 54,000 loans bunched at the MID limit. The number of bunched loans represents approximately 4.5 percent of the sample. The level of bunching and estimated counterfactual number of loans imply an average reduction in the amount borrowed between 9 and 10 percent, and mortgage demand elasticities between -0.132 and -0.115. The estimated elasticities imply that from 2004-2016 the MID induced $49.52 billion in deadweight loss, with two-thirds coming in the 2004-2007 period. Simulation results suggest an aggregate annual reduction in mortgage borrowing of about $345 million among borrowers that lose marginal tax deductibility from lowering the MID limit to $750k and an annual deadweight loss reduction of $132.3 million.====The primary threat to validity for the empirical bunching estimate is that borrowers change lending behavior at exactly $1 million for reasons other than the change in tax policy. One possibility is that $1 million represents a salient level of borrowing, so borrowers are averse to larger loans for psychological reasons. To confront this threat, I implement alternative empirical strategies in addition to the primary bunching analysis. First, I build in estimates of bunching at other salient loan amounts (50,0000 thresholds, 100,000 thresholds, and other $1 million thresholds) into the empirical work. Second, I estimate differences in bunching across U.S. states that have different MID policies to see if the amount of bunching changes with policy generosity, including estimating how bunching changes in two states where MID policy changes during the time period of my data. Lastly, I perform a validity check that uses the elimination of the $1 million limit and imposition of new $750k limit to re-estimate bunching using data from 2018. The 2018 results suggest that the salience effect at $1 million is mostly predictable using bunching at other salient loan amounts, and that it is about half the size of the bunching attributable to tax policy changes.====Previous work on the MID examines how it changes homeownership (Glaeser and Shapiro 2003; Hilber and Turner 2014), home prices (Martin and Hanson 2016), the size of home purchased (Hanson 2012a), and government revenues (Poterba and Sinai 2011). More recently, Sommer and Sullivan (2018) simulate how eliminating the MID impacts housing markets using a calibrated equilibrium model. Recent work by DeFusco and Paciorek (2017) examines bunching in the mortgage distribution around conforming limits,==== but this is the first paper to investigate how the budget kink created by tax deductibility limits changes borrower behavior.====The remainder of the paper begins with a short background on the mortgage interest deduction and a simple model of how the deductibility limit induces behavioral change and deadweight loss. Section III introduces the data used in estimation. Section IV presents the empirical estimation strategy. Section V presents results for the primary estimation strategy and several alternatives. Section VI implements validity checks that explore moving the MID limit to $750k and the possibility for lender behavioral change. Section VII presents applications of the estimated elasticity of mortgage demand: deadweight loss estimates and a simulation analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) change to the MID limit.

We construct the universe of US federally designated natural disasters from 1920 to 2010. We find that severe disasters increase out-migration rates at the county level by 1.5 percentage points and lower housing prices/rents by 2.5–5.0 percent. The migration response to milder disasters is smaller but has been increasing over time. The economic response to disasters is most consistent with falling local productivity and ====. Disasters that convey more information about future disaster risk increase the pace of out-migration.","Natural disasters regularly strike major cities in the United States, leading to numerous fatalities and billions of dollars of property and infrastructure damage each year. Recent examples include Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York City and the surrounding area in 2012, and Hurricane Harvey, which caused severe flooding in Houston in 2017, each resulting in more than 100 deaths. Climate science suggests that as global greenhouse gas emissions increase, so too will the number and severity of natural disasters (IPCC 2012). Furthermore, as more economic activity clusters along America's coasts, a greater share of the population is now at risk of exposure to natural disasters (Changnon et. al. 2000, Rappaport and Sachs 2003, Pielke et. al. 2008).====This paper analyzes an original dataset for which we compiled the universe of federally designated natural disasters in the United States from 1920 to 2010.==== Fig. 1 displays annual counts of disaster events at the county level using this new series, and Appendix Fig. 1 breaks down the series by disaster type. From 1920 to 1964, observations are based on historical archival data from the American National Red Cross (ARC). We then combine this information with disaster counts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and its predecessors starting in the 1950s.==== Through most of the century, the US experienced around 500 county-level disaster events each year (one disaster can contribute to numerous county-level disaster events – for example, as a hurricane moves up the coast and strikes multiple counties). Since the early 1990s, there has been a clear acceleration in disaster counts, reaching around 1,500 county-level events per year by the 2000s. Winter storms and hurricanes contribute the most to this increase in frequency.==== Our extensive new dataset aggregates these annual disaster events to the decadal level in order to investigate the effect of natural disasters on local economies.====A natural disaster event might affect the local economy in several ways: reducing firm productivity by destroying productive capital or disrupting supply chains, creating unanticipated disamenities for consumers, or demolishing part of the housing stock. Each of these channels implies a different relationship between disaster events and local wages, housing prices/rents, and net migration to an area. Furthermore, disasters could shock local areas out of an inefficient equilibrium established through path dependence, allowing the economy to reset to a new equilibrium (for example, by destroying outdated buildings and other durable capital such as in Hornbeck and Keniston (2017)).====We compare a series of economic outcomes within counties before and after a disaster strikes, relative to comparison counties that do not experience a natural disaster in the decade. The underlying assumption is that the presence of a disaster in a particular decade does not coincide with other economic changes at the county level. We find no evidence that disasters that will occur in the next decade (====) have any effect on current out-migration. In some specifications, we also include county-specific trends to account for the fact that, for example, disasters are more common in coastal areas that might be otherwise attracting economic activity over time.====We find that a severe disaster event leads to lower family income, heightened out-migration rates and lower housing prices/rents in a county over the decade. Together, these results suggest that natural disasters reduce firm productivity, thereby lowering wages in the area, which encourages out-migration and falling housing prices. Local responses to disaster events increased after 1980 as national disaster activity has become more frequent in recent years, perhaps because residents infer that each event is associated with a higher risk of future disasters. The advent of FEMA in 1978 did not dampen this trend. If natural disasters were able to shock local areas out of inefficient equilibria regularly, we would expect a stronger out-migration response to disasters in slow-growing areas compared to areas that were experiencing faster economic or population growth. Yet, if anything, we find a stronger net out-migration response in growing areas, contrary to the idea that disasters regularly shock local economies off an inefficient path.====On average, net out-migration from a county increases by 1.5 percentage points during a decade facing a severe natural disaster (8 percent of a standard deviation). The migration response to one severe natural disaster is around half as large as the estimated migration effect of a one standard-deviation reduction in local employment growth. Our preferred specification considers a disaster to be “severe” if it leads to 25 or more deaths, the median value for disasters with known fatality counts. Results are robust to alternative fatality thresholds (20 to 200 fatalities), but we find stronger out-migration from the most severe disasters (500 fatalities of more). In the full sample, there are small out-migration responses to milder disasters, especially hurricanes and wild fires. However, after 1980, a period of rising natural disaster frequency and intensity, we find a sizeable migration response to floods, hurricanes, and wild fires. The heightened response to smaller disasters in the more recent period is consistent with the possibility that these events confer more information about future disaster risk, given the growing frequency of disasters over time.====We also find that median housing prices/rents fall by 2.5 to 5 percent after a severe natural disaster, the same order of magnitude as the housing market response to a five percent decrease in school quality as measured by test scores (Black 1999; Black and Machin 2011). Poverty rates increase in areas hit by severe disasters, which is consistent with either an out-migration of households above the poverty line or in-migration of the poor (perhaps in response to lower housing prices), or a causal effect of natural disasters on the probability that the existing population falls into poverty. Our estimates capture the net effect of disasters on local economies, after any rebuilding, new investments, or disbursement of disaster relief funds.====On the margin, FEMA disaster declarations and the extent of disaster relief payments are affected by the political process (Downton and Pielke 2001, Garrett and Sobel 2003).==== We provide suggestive evidence that our results are not being driven by biases that would arise if disaster events were declared more often in politically connected states (e.g., those controlled by the same party as the president). First, any political connection that would lead states to receive an unwarranted disaster designation and disaster relief should generate other flows of valuable discretionary federal funds, thereby, if anything, leading to net in-migration. Thus, we would expect the political component of disaster declarations to bias ==== finding that disasters lead to out-migration or falling housing prices. Second, although the official designation of mild weather events as “disasters” may be subject to political manipulation, the largest disasters have all received federal disaster designations.==== We show that the estimated effect of “severe disasters” is robust to various definitions, ranging from a threshold of 10 to 500 deaths, suggesting that individuals respond similarly to any disaster that is sufficiently damaging. The association between large disasters and out-migration also holds when instrumenting for disaster activity with historically available climate variables (e.g., maximum and minimum temperatures) to account for any association between disaster declarations and local politics, and is present regardless of whether the political party of the state's governor matches the party of the President.====Our work contributes to two strands of the literature in urban and environmental economics. First is a series of macroeconomic studies that use cross-country panel regressions to study how changing temperature, rainfall, and increased exposure to natural disasters conditions affect economic growth (Dell, Jones and Olken 2012, 2014; Cavallo, et al. 2013; Hsiang and Jina 2014; Burke, Hsiang and Miguel 2015; Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Kocornik-Mina et al. 2020). These studies have not led to a consensus. Results range from long-lasting effects of natural disasters on national income to near-immediate recovery. By analyzing the effect of many natural disasters within a single country (the United States) over many decades, we are able to hold constant many core institutional and geographic features of the economy that may be otherwise correlated with disaster prevalence in a cross-country setting (e.g., democracy, temperate climate). We add to a small body of work studying disasters within a country, including Anttila-Hughes and Hsiang (2013), which analyzes more than 2,000 typhoons in the Philippines.==== In our universe of US disasters, we document results more consistent with the finding of long-lasting disaster effects on local economies.====A second set of papers present case studies of specific major disasters on existing residents (see, for example in the US, Smith and McCarty 1996 and Hallstrom and Smith 2005 on Hurricane Andrew; Hornbeck 2012 and Long and Siu 2018 on the Dustbowl; Hornbeck and Naidu 2014 on the 1927 Mississippi flood; and Vigdor 2008, Sastry and Gregory 2014, Bleemer and Van der Klaauw 2017 and Deryugina, Kawano and Levitt 2018 on Hurricane Katrina; for disasters in other countries, see Nobles, Frankenberg, and Thomas 2015 and Groger and Zylberberg 2016). Most of these case studies find large effects of a major disaster on out-migration or population loss. While it is important to study these major cases, most disasters are not as severe as these notable outliers. Our comprehensive dataset allows us to examine a much wider universe of disasters. In two related papers, Strobl (2011) and Fussell, et al. (2017) use county-level panels of US counties and find that hurricanes reduce local economic growth and affected population in recent decades. Strobl leverages detailed data on wind speeds and a scientific model of hurricane intensity to generate a proxy for local damage. The (complementary) advantage of our paper is that we examine all disaster types – hurricanes represent less than 10 percent of disaster events – over a much longer historical period.",The effect of natural disasters on economic activity in US counties: A century of data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300280,20 May 2020,2020,Research Article,100.0

Furthermore, more educated cities appear to grow faster. These two trends could portend the divergence of cities by skill, with low-skill workers segregated in slow-growing or declining cities. This paper compares measures of skill divergence and finds that relative measures, which have the property of scale invariance, show no divergence for the period from 1970 to 2010. In addition, the relation between skill intensity and city growth appears to be concave, so that differences in the growth rate of skill intensity across cities may diminish over time as the average college share of the country rises.","A variety of works, including Moretti, 2004, Moretti, 2012, Moretti, 2013, Berry and Glaeser (2005), Glaeser (2012), and Diamond (2016), have noted a divergence in the human capital levels of US cities. The two most commonly reported measures of an area’s skill level are the share of adults who are college graduates, and the ratio of college graduates to those who lack a college degree, known as the skill intensity ratio, or SIR. Studies have considered the period since 1940, but focused on 1970–2010. Over this period, measures of absolute dispersion in these human capital metrics across cities have increased.====The literature has regarded such divergence as a consequence of two particular findings regarding the dynamics of local economies (Glaeser, Scheinkman, Shleifer, 1995, Simon, 1998, Simon, 2004, Simon, Nardinelli, 2002, Glaeser, Shapiro, 2003, Glaeser, Saiz, Shapiro, 2006, Wheeler, 2006). First, absolute change in the SIR of cities has been found to vary positively with lagged SIR. Thus it appears that differences in the skill intensity of cities propagate, in that they are caused by prior differences. Second, urban growth rates have been an increasing function of lagged SIR. These results together suggest that more-educated workers are increasingly concentrated spatially and that concentration is found in fast growing cities. Conversely, it appears that low-skilled workers are concentrating in locations where population is either slow growing or declining. This implies that the evolution of the skill intensity of cities is contributing to inequality of income or opportunity.====These patterns of changing skill intensity appear difficult to explain by simple application of economic theory. Absolute divergence in the SIR of cities implies that areas where human capital is relatively abundant have larger increases in human capital than places where it is scarce. This is puzzling given incentives to relocate and the relatively low cost of mobility. The idea of regional income convergence seems similarly inconsistent with the findings of diverging local human capital. Diverging SIR, especially if SIR is positively related to urban growth rates, appears to require special explanation because of these implications for the possible failure of labor allocation across cities to conform to requirements for economic efficiency.====This paper examines different measures of the average human capital per worker of a city and alternative ways to measure changes in the distribution of these metrics. Just as income inequality can be measured in absolute terms using variance, or relative terms using the coefficient of variation or Gini coefficient, different indexes of skill divergence are possible. Because income and skill ratios are growing nationally, absolute and relative measures of inequality provide dramatically different estimates of divergence. In particular, relative measures of divergence, which are scale invariant, indicate that the spatial distribution of SIR was mostly constant over period from 1970 to 2010. During the same time period, absolute measures, which lack the property of scale invariance, indicate SIR diverged rapidly.====The finding that relative and absolute measures of divergence produce different results is common in economics. In growing societies, many characteristics of cities are subject to aggregate change over time. Total population, human capital, output, income, etc., are all growing systematically and therefore create scale independence challenges for measures of divergence. The specific case of human capital per worker examined here is a useful illustration because its potential divergence has been the object of significant attention due to concerns over changing inequality in society.====The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. Section 2 discusses the differences between absolute and relative measures of divergence and their uses with a growing economy. Section 3 discusses the relation between divergence, relative or absolute, and urban growth. Next are two parallel empirical sections. First, Section 4 reports results from testing whether absolute and relative changes in the human capital intensity of cities are positively related to initial level. Then, in Section 5 a non-linear parametric growth equation is estimated relating rates of growth in city population to initial city size and human capital intensity.

Using data on calls for service dispatched to LAPD patrols from 2014 through 2017, we assess if heightened awareness of immigration enforcement, as captured by a novel Google Trends index on related searches, is associated with reduced calls to report domestic violence in predominately Latino noncitizen neighborhoods. We find that domestic violence calls per capita dropped in LAPD reporting districts with a higher concentration of Latino noncitizens as awareness about immigration enforcement increased. The decline provides empirical evidence of the “chilling effect” of immigration enforcement on Latino immigrant engagement with police, underscoring the need to engage communities increasingly alienated by federal immigration policy.","The unwillingness of Latino and immigrant communities to report criminal incidents or assist in investigations is a recognized concern of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). In 2017, the department announced that crime reports among Latinos in the first three months of 2017 had dropped relative the same period the year prior (Gorman, 2017). Officials cited a 10 percent decline in domestic violence reports as a particularly troublesome shift. The department attributed this decline to heightened mistrust of the criminal justice system amid federal pressure for police agencies to assist immigration authorities. Law enforcement officials have expressed similar concerns (Khashu, 2009), as well as scholarly work on the topic (Cox and Miles, 2015; Vidales et al., 2009; Vishnuvajjala, 2012).====This study contributes to a small, but growing body of research examining the impact of immigration enforcement on community-police engagement. Prior research has pointed out correlations between immigration enforcement and individual willingness to report crime, showing that crime reporting is inhibited in areas with sizeable immigrant populations. Yet, to date, only one study has examined the influence of immigration enforcement on community cooperation (Cox and Miles, 2015), finding little to no impact of the Secure Communities program on the rate at which crimes are solved.====Our study makes four important contributions. First, instead of relying on a specific immigration policy or enforcement action, we use Google Trends data to identify periods in which individuals may be more alert to ongoing immigration enforcement. Second, we use a more direct measure of community engagement unencumbered by police or prosecutorial discretion, namely, calls for service. Third, we use geographic information on ethnicity and citizenship to gauge the differential impact of immigration enforcement awareness in areas with residents more likely to fear immigration enforcement. Fourth, we pay particular attention to calls made to report domestic violence given the vulnerability of immigrants, particularly those undocumented, to this type of crime (Raj and Silverman, 2002).====We find that between January 2014 and December 2017, domestic violence calls per capita dropped 3 percent when immigration enforcement awareness rose by one standard deviation in predominately Latino noncitizen reporting districts, relative to others. This finding proves robust to the use of alternative measures of immigration enforcement awareness. In addition, placebo checks confirm the distinct effect of awareness on domestic violence calls. We then perform an event study that exploits the uptick in immigration enforcement awareness following the 2016 presidential election. We find that domestic violence calls per capita declined 8 percent in predominately Latino noncitizen reporting districts, compared to others, after President Trump was elected to office. This result validates our initial finding and suggests that anti-immigrant rhetoric and stepped-up immigration enforcement in the months following the election reduced engagement in Latino noncitizen reporting districts. Our findings persist when we use crime reports, account for incident severity, and consider other types of calls, including calls to report violent and nonviolent incidents.====In sum, we find evidence that recent escalations in rhetoric and federal enforcement actions have had a “chilling effect” on calls for service among Latino noncitizens in Los Angeles, most strikingly for domestic violence. These results counter the finding from Cox and Miles (2015) that heightened immigration enforcement has little to no impact on community cooperation with law enforcement. Our findings highlight the challenge law enforcement agencies face in protecting Latino immigrant communities as immigration enforcement escalates. A back-of-the-envelope calculation using our estimates suggests that one domestic violence call for service in Latino noncitizen districts is suppressed for every two deportations. This finding highlights the tradeoff between aggressive interior immigration enforcement and protection against domestic violence. The tradeoff ratifies concerns expressed by many law enforcement officials and underscores the need for policy measures to ensure the safety of communities increasingly alienated by federal immigration policy.",Immigration enforcement awareness and community engagement with police: Evidence from domestic violence calls in Los Angeles,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300243,18 March 2020,2020,Research Article,102.0

This paper provides estimates of the price sensitivity of land re-development, a crucial parameter for the success of these policies. My estimates measure how prices affect long-run conversion of unused or underused previously developed land in England. The empirical strategy uses school test scores and admission district boundaries in a boundary discontinuity design to generate variation in housing demand that is orthogonal to re-development costs. Results show that the probability of re-development is effectively sensitive to housing prices. Estimates indicate that a 1% increase in prices leads to a 0.07 percentage point reduction in the fraction of hectares containing brownfield land. Price differences or substantial subsidies could lead to a significant amount of re-development in the long run. This is confirmed by observed land use changes between 2007 and 2011 being disproportionately concentrated in high price areas.","Cities are areas of intense land use. Yet it is common to find vacant, idle or underused land within them. According to Pagano and Bowman (2000), up to 15% of land within US cities was vacant in 2000. In England, idle or underused previously-developed land sites represented 5.45% of total urban land in 2007 (Adams et al., 2010). This prevalence is puzzling. Land demand is high in cities; in urban models this is what usually results in higher densities (Brueckner, 1987). Is the presence of these plots sensitive to local demand conditions? Knowing this is instrumental to understanding how market mechanisms shape urban density and, through density, the set of associated social, economic and environmental outcomes identified by urban economists. In addition, it is also informative about the potential success of the re-development promotion policies which have become popular over the past decades.====In this paper, I provide the first available estimates of the sensitivity of re-development to local housing prices, a key parameter linking infill site development with market forces. The analysis focuses on English previously-developed land (PdL) or ==== sites, defined as land that was developed but is now vacant, derelict, or has known potential for re-development.==== The empirical challenge to be addressed here is similar to the classical problem of estimating supply or demand elasticities from observed equilibrium outcomes. To estimate the price elasticity of PdL re-development I need a demand-shifter, a variable that affects demand but is known not to affect re-development costs or other determinants of supply. My empirical strategy will use school test scores and admission district boundaries in a boundary discontinuity design (BDD) to generate variation in housing demand that is credibly exogenous to costs. Implementation follows Gibbons et al. (2013) in combining standard BDD methods (as in Black 1999 or Dell 2010) with spatial matching, and uses average test scores or school value-added as instruments for prices. I start by conducting a cross-sectional analysis to compare the presence of brownfield sites in high price and otherwise identical low price areas across an administrative boundary. Next, I extend this analysis to look at land use changes and estimate the effect of prices on subsequent residential construction activity.====My estimates indicate that a 1% increase in prices reduces the presence of brownfield sites in a hectare by 0.07 percentage points. While this effect appears to be small, only 1.5% of the hectares in my sample contained a PdL site in 2007. Therefore, results indicate that persistent increases in prices would lead to significant land re-development. This is consistent with separate estimates computed for ex-post land use changes in the 2007–2011 period.====By exploiting new boundaries introduced in the late 90s, as well as value-added measures of school quality, I address the potential confounding factors induced by persistent differences in administrative boundaries or household sorting, with little impact on my main estimates. In addition, I show that the price sensitivity of re-development is substantial in large cities, which are areas exhibiting a disproportionate number of PdL sites and also where local governments are more likely to engage in specific re-development policies. Using data on planning restrictiveness from Hilber and Vermeulen (2016), I show that the elasticity of re-development is lower in areas with tight planning restrictions. Finally, I find that brownfield presence is sensitive to prices even for relatively high cost sites, such as those in which land was previously used in manufacturing, mining or physical infrastructure.====My estimates inform the debate on ==== policies and urban compactness in urban planning and economics. A growing consensus among urban planners and policy-makers has emerged on the desirability of achieving ==== (see OECD, 2012), cities with high densities and few undeveloped patches of land within the urban footprint. The increased density is often assumed to reduce commuting time, promote productivity gains and reduce driving as well as environmental damage. While the debate over the supposed welfare enhancing effects of compactness continues (see Ahlfeldt, Pietrostefani, 2019, Cheshire, 2006) several cities have embraced the smart growth agenda and its set of recommended policies. In many cases, governments have tackled this by promoting the re-development of brownfield or previously-developed land. Examples include the brownfield first policy in the United Kingdom which aims at channelling at least 60% of new developments to brownfield sites. Brownfield initiatives exist in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and many other US cities, providing either grants or financing options to promote re-development. remediation relief for polluted sites provided by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States often achieves a similar outcome. Appendix C provides a review of policies tailored to promote re-development and remediation in North America and Europe. The potential success of incentive-based re-development policies crucially depends on the price sensitivity of brownfield conversion. With a value of zero or close to zero, re-development is unlikely, even when prices increase substantially or a subsidy is in place. Conversely, positive and large elasticities imply high responsiveness and a potentially large effect of incentive policies such as tax breaks or remediation subsidies. Estimates reported below indicate a substantial price sensitivity, suggesting that these policies could induce a substantial amount of brownfield re-development.====This study contributes to the long literature housing supply. Housing supply elasticities are crucial to understand city-level house price volatilities (Glaeser, Gyourko, Saiz, 2008, Paciorek, 2013), city systems’ responses to shocks (Hornbeck and Moretti, 2015) and urban growth (Glaeser et al., 2006). The methods developed over the last twenty years combine longitudinal data on home-building with city level price indices (Malpezzi, Maclennan, 2001, Green, Malpezzi, Mayo, 2005) and incorporate supply shifters such as geographical characteristics and regulation constraints to obtain city level elasticity estimates (as in Saiz, 2010). These city-level estimates are important in their own right, but they tell us very little about re-development of idle land, as city level changes in housing supply may also be affected by sprawl or changes in building heights. The estimates provided below are, to my knowledge, the first in the literature to focus specifically on re-development of idle or vacant land.====This study also contributes to the literature on land re-development. Wheaton et al. (1982) and Brueckner (1980) both provide urban models which feature re-development of housing stock when the price of redeveloped land is larger than re-development costs plus the price of land in its current use. This was successfully tested empirically in Rosenthal and Helsley (1994) using data for Vancouver and in subsequent empirical work (see for example Dye and McMillen (2007), Charles (2014), McMillen (2017) and the references therein). Most of these studies can estimate the relationship between local demand and re-development correctly under strong assumptions. My approach here is different in two dimensions. First, I focus on empty land parcels rather than teardown properties that have been the usual object of this literature. Second, I use a BDD method to obtain quasi-experimental variation in local demand that allows for cleaner estimation of my parameter of interest.====A strand of the literature on vacant land has focused on linking re-development delays to price uncertainty. Titman et al. (1985) presents a simple model showing that increasing demand uncertainty increases the option value of vacant land and reduces building activity. On the empirical front, Cunningham (2006) reports that areas with higher price uncertainty in Seattle feature higher land prices and slower development.==== Instead of estimating the effect of uncertainty on re-development or timing to development, I attempt to credibly estimate the direct, first-order effects of demand on re-development and the pervasiveness of abandoned land.====My paper also contributes to the literature studying the effect of site clean-up policies on local housing prices and neighbourhood composition. Greenstone and Gallagher (2008) use discontinuities in the assignment of clean-up funding to identify price effects of clean up policies in the US. Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins (2013) exploit the timing of clean-up and document that price effects are concentrated at the lower end of the price distribution. There is also evidence of household sorting as a response to these clean-up efforts (Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins, 2011) and of persistent negative externalities after clean up took place (Kiel and Williams, 2007). My paper follows the ==== direction relative to these studies, by looking at the effect of prices on conversion of PdL sites. In this sense, the estimates below should be an indication of the effectiveness of subsidies to trigger clean-up of polluted sites.====This study also relates to the literature estimating the effects of new construction on local housing prices. Ooi and Le (2013) use a hedonic model to study the effect of infill development of vacant or underused sites on local house prices in Singapore, finding positive and robust effects. Zahirovich-Herbert and Gibler (2014) study the effect of new construction and find price effects are especially high when newbuilds are well above the local mean floor area. My paper flips the direction of causality by studying how prices shape conversion and new-building at the local level. Finally, this paper relates to studies of urban decline. Both in Glaeser and Gyourko (2005) and in more recent work by Owens et al. (2017), vacant land is a key feature of a declining city. My contribution relative to this work is to look at the link between demand and re-development in a context in which vacant land is not the result of general urban decline.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the dataset used in the empirical analysis. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy and Section 4 provides cross-sectional estimates of the effect of prices on land conversion, as well as results for ==== land use changes. Section 5 provides a discussion of heterogeneity in my main estimates of interest.

Using an ==== approach, we find that as the level of energy efficiency increases by ten percent, the market value of the dwelling increases by around 2.2 percent – quite a precise reflection of both the required capital outlay and future energy savings. These results are confirmed in a repeat-sales analysis. Importantly, examining the role of energy performance certificates (EPCs), we document that the extent of capitalization of energy efficiency is not affected by information provision, questioning the continued need for government-imposed certification programs.","In today’s debate on climate change, and the carbon externality from energy consumption, energy efficiency seems the panacea that is globally embraced by policy makers. The building stock represents an important target for public policy, due to its sizable share of global energy use and its significant potential for efficiency improvements. For example, the European Union aims for a 20 percent reduction in energy consumption by 2020, based solely on “cost effective” measures that are paid back by reductions in utility bills. China has included energy efficiency as a cornerstone of its current five-year plan, with the ambition to retrofit four million square feet of non-residential space. And while the U.S. lacks comprehensive federal policy aimed at reducing energy consumption in buildings, individual states have passed legislation to do just that. Most prominently, under California’s Global Warming Solutions Act (also known as AB 32), 50 percent of existing commercial buildings will need to be retrofitted to “zero net energy” by 2030. But of course, the success of such policies critically depends on the ability of homeowners, developers, and commercial real estate investors to identify efficiency opportunities and their willingness to invest in energy efficiency retrofits.====Economists have long recognized that market barriers and market failures can lead to what has been termed the “energy efficiency gap” – the difference between the socially optimal level of energy efficiency investments and the level that is actually achieved (Allcott and Greenstone, 2012).==== Explanations for this gap vary between hidden costs of energy efficiency investments, principal-agent problems and behavioral failures such as inattention, while others argue that the energy efficiency gap is merely an artifact of overly optimistic engineering assumptions (see Gillingham, Palmer, et al., 2014, Gillingham, Palmer, et al., 2014, for a discussion).====Another potential market barrier that may lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency is a lack of transparency, especially in the opaque real estate market. Homebuyers may be unable to accurately assess the energy efficiency of a home, as some features are imperfectly visible. Indeed, following Akerlof (1970)’s “lemons” model, information asymmetry between seller and buyer is generally accepted as one of the main reasons leading to underinvestment in energy efficiency in the housing market (Gillingham et al., 2009). In the absence of perfect information, potential buyers are unable to incorporate future energy expenditures into their purchasing decisions, and therefore (current) homeowners prefer not to invest in energy efficiency improvements. In recent years, energy certificates and labels have been proposed as a remedy – comparable to food labels (Bollinger et al., 2011) and restaurant hygiene scorecards (Jin et al., 2003). For instance, EU member states have been required since 2009 to implement energy performance certification (EPC) schemes for residential dwellings.==== By providing information to market participants regarding the energy performance of buildings, policy makers expect differentiation in demand based on energy characteristics of the dwellings, which in return may lead to higher investments in energy efficiency. The effectiveness of this policy of course hinges on the extent to which buyers are willing to pay for increased energy efficiency.====The academic literature provides some empirical evidence on the relationship between energy efficiency and real estate prices, but most research focuses on the commercial real estate sector, which arguably represents a more efficient market with more rational agents (see Eichholtz, Kok, Quigley, 2010, Eichholtz, Kok, Quigley, 2010, Eichholtz, Kok, Quigley, 2013). For the residential market, using a sample of dwellings with energy performance certificates (EPCs), Brounen and Kok (2011) document that consumers pay a four percent premium for homes labeled as “efficient” (labels A, B or C) in the Netherlands. Kahn and Kok (2014), using transaction data from the California housing market, document that homes labeled with a “green” certificate are sold at a small price premium as compared to non-labeled homes. As energy labels are not necessarily available in other countries, researchers have also used alternative approaches to identify the market value of energy efficiency. Zheng et al. (2012) document that “green” buildings, which are identified based on an index created using Google search, are sold at a price premium during the pre-sale stage. In the same spirit, Dastrup et al. (2012) find that solar panel installations in California are capitalized into house prices at a 3.5 percent price premium.====While this body of literature is significant and growing, a common methodological drawback is the potential bias that may arise from the omission of unobserved dwelling characteristics correlated with measures of energy efficiency.==== Typically, in order to minimize the omitted variable bias, the empirical strategy is to include a detailed set of observable characteristics into hedonic pricing models. However, this strategy does not completely rule out the presence of unobservable factors, and multicollinearity among the observed characteristics often leads to imprecise and sometimes implausible estimates of attribute prices. Indeed, Atkinson and Halvorsen (1984) document that the difficulties caused by multicollinearity are more apparent when analyzing energy efficiency, leading to insignificant or theoretically incorrect estimates.====Besides these methodological challenges, the available literature on residential energy efficiency has not been able to distinguish between the impact of certification policies (i.e. information provision) and the energy efficiency of the home itself, as observable to the buyer in the absence of energy certificates. Private consumers might already be incorporating the energy efficiency of a dwelling into their purchasing decisions, independent of the availability of additional information. From a policy perspective, it is important to assess whether energy policies based on information provision are effective, given that considerable resources are devoted to, for example, increasing the diffusion of home energy certification programs.====This study is the first to directly examine the capitalization of energy efficiency improvements in the housing market, including the role of information provision. Using a large, representative dataset from the Netherlands, we employ a variety of estimation strategies to identify the capitalization of energy efficiency in the housing market, and the extent to which information asymmetry affects such capitalization. The analysis benefits from a continuous measure of energy efficiency provided by engineering estimates. These engineering estimates form the base for widely adopted energy performance certificates, enabling us to estimate the elasticity of home prices with respect to their energy efficiency. In addition to including detailed dwelling characteristics in the hedonic model, we use an instrumental variable approach to address the issue of omitted variable bias. We exploit the 1973-74 oil crisis, which creates an exogenous discontinuity in the energy efficiency level of dwellings constructed before and after this event, and the evolution of building codes as instruments for energy efficiency. Finally, we employ a repeated sales analysis as an alternative identification strategy.====Our results indicate that energy efficiency is capitalized into home prices, but that OLS estimates are biased downwards. Using an IV approach, we find that as the level of predicted energy efficiency increases by ten percent, the market value of the dwelling increases by around 2.2 percent, for an average dwelling in the Dutch housing market. Using a repeated sales analysis, based on a sample of homes that experienced energy efficiency improvements between consecutive sales, we show that the change in the level of energy efficiency is capitalized quite precisely in the second transaction. The estimated price effect is comparable to the IV estimates.====In order to assess whether the capitalization of energy efficiency varies with information provision, we create a common energy efficiency measure, based on actual energy consumption for a set of homes that are labeled with an energy performance certificate and a control group that is not labeled. We document that the market value of a change in actual gas consumption is close to the value of a change in the engineering estimate of energy efficiency indicator, as provided by energy performance certificate. Our findings do not provide evidence of a different capitalization rate for homes that transacted with an energy performance certificate. We also employ a regression discontinuity approach to test whether the actual label rating (ranging from A to G) has market implications. Our results do not provide an indication of a significant change in the transaction price at the threshold energy efficiency level that is used to assign homes into different label classifications. This finding implies that, after controlling for the continuous energy efficiency level of a home, the EU energy label does not seem to lead to a significant change in the buyer’s valuation of the energy efficiency of a dwelling.====The results of this paper have important policy implications, particularly for energy efficiency programs. One reason for households not to undertake seemingly profitable investments in energy efficiency may be the uncertainty regarding the financial return, as upgrading a dwelling to improve its energy efficiency typically involves a significant upfront investment. For instance, from the homeowner’s point of view, the expected length of tenure may not be sufficient to offset the cost of the investment by the reduction in energy costs. The willingness to invest in energy efficiency may be even lower for institutional investors, as they typically lease out their investment properties, and therefore do not directly benefit from the reduction in utility bills.====For homeowners and institutional investors to better assess the total return on investments in energy efficiency, it is therefore important to understand both the immediate returns through lower utility bills as well as the indirect, future returns through capitalization of energy efficiency improvement in the sales price of the building. Our findings suggest that energy efficiency is capitalized quite precisely in the housing market (in addition to the immediate financial benefits from lower energy expenses).====As discussed by Allcott and Greenstone (2012), information campaigns can play an important role in the diffusion of energy efficiency investments. However, the results in this paper do not provide evidence for the intangible effects of energy labels on transaction prices. Given the significant efforts put into energy certification programs, further research is needed into their effectiveness – perhaps the increased salience of energy costs and energy efficiency now obviates the need for such programs. These programs may be more useful as public awareness campaigns that highlight the financial benefits that households and investors can derive from energy efficiency, as for example highlighted by this study.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

I find that airports have led to, on average, 3.9 percent growth in total employment (and 3.4% growth in population) per decade. Over the 30-year period for which wage and air traffic data are available, earnings per worker increased by 2%, and per-capita personal income increased by 3%, corresponding to growth rates of up to 1.2 percent per decade, respectively.","“We’re in a service business. You call, you write, but there is nothing like face to face”==== said the CEO of a Florida-based software firm in reflecting on the role of air service to his firm. A California-based fuel tank manufacturer surmised the end of air service at Chico airport in 2014 had hurt firm growth, noting that it had become more difficult to connect with outside companies to form partnerships, increase sales, and otherwise expand.==== More than ever, it appears that air service could play a critical role in the success of business, especially in smaller cities. In recent years, however, factors such as consolidation in the airline industry, increasing fuel costs, and changes in general economic conditions have converged, leading to fewer flights offered to such locations.====Municipal governments have responded with subsidies and incentives such as revenue guarantees in a bid to counter these trends. Such expenditures are not trivial; for example, a 2013 study pegs such costs for 20 smaller communities in the contiguous United States at nearly $225 million dollars annually (Wittman and Swelbar, 2013). This response is consistent with the general belief that airports are vital contributors to their local economies. In particular, if a city’s economic output depends on people located in distant cities collaborating through face-to-face meetings, air service could facilitate firm and regional level growth. Atack et al. (2014) argued that a similar process was at work as early as the 19th century via the railroad system. They found that banks located closer to railroad routes were more likely to have “good” banking outcomes; a primary channel for this appeared to be information flows that led banks to modify their asset compositions accordingly.====In order to better understand whether intervention such as subsidies and other initiatives are warranted, this study aims to provide causal estimates of the contribution of airports to local economic outcomes. Estimation is complicated by the fact that airports, similar to other pieces of infrastructure such as roads, are not randomly assigned to cities, which could lead to biased estimates. In the case of airports, endogeneity is even more of a concern, given the law in the United States specifically stipulates that the construction and operation of airports is a local responsibility. Were airports strategically constructed in cities that were expected to thrive anyway, so that outcomes that might be attributed to airports potentially result from other factors? Or, alternatively, were airports built in places with relatively dim prospects in the hope of stimulating growth in those local economies, such that the true effect of aviation could actually be larger than that implied by a naive estimate? To overcome this, instead of relying on traditional (and possibly endogenous) metrics of air traffic, such as enplanements or flights, the focus is on “treated” cities, that is, those that have an airport.====I estimate the treatment effect of an airport on outcomes such as employment, population, and income, over the post-World-War-II period (here, 1950–2010). This approach is conceptually similar to Baum-Snow (2007)’s work on highways and suburbanization adapted to the aviation context. Since airports receive traffic from multiple points in space, conceptualizing the treatment in this way is reasonable. To accomplish this, I collect novel historical data on airport placement and industry outcomes which are compiled into a long panel spanning 1900–2010 at 10-year intervals. A set of historical landing field locations is used to identify a set of control non-airport cities. Since the largest cities have few, if any, credible counterfactual cities available, this research design necessitates a focus on mid-sized and smaller airports.====A key advantage of conceptualizing the study in this way is the ability to estimate the long-run effects of aviation in the United States over its entire history. This provides a common framework that corroborates and unifies findings from previous work, such as Blonigen and Cristea (2015), Brueckner (2003), and Green (2007), which all used changes in air traffic to examine the effects of aviation over discrete time periods. Non-parallel trends in key population and employment measures between pre-period airport and non-airport control cities rule out a standard difference-in-differences approach. Thus, an event-time pooled synthetic control event study approach is employed to obtain causal estimates. First, counterfactual outcomes are first generated for each airport city. Then, an event study is run on the resulting case pairs (an approach similar to Liu, 2015).====I find that airports have led to 3.9% growth in total employment (and 3.4% growth in population) per decade. Nontradable employment is estimated at approximately 2.9% growth over the average decade. Over the 1980–2010 period, airports increased earnings per worker by 2%, and per-capita personal income by 3%. These correspond to growth rates of up to 1.2 percent per decade, respectively. Airports have increased personal income growth by 3.5 percent per decade over the 30-year period, corroborating the causal growth estimated on total employment and population. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate the presence of an airport in a CBSA leads to average population growth of almost 1500 people per decade, almost 1,000 of whom are people of working age (ages 16–64). The average airport contributes to the creation of 916 jobs, 52 of which are in the transportation sector, and 660 of which are in the nontradable sector. Using payroll as a proxy for output, airports are responsible for an average of $77 million (in 2010 dollars) in output growth for a given decade over the study period.","The role of airports in city employment growth, 1950–2010",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300115,13 February 2020,2020,Research Article,105.0

The effects of friendship links are identified using across-cohort, within school variation in ==== composition of the student's cohort or grade. We find that increases in the number of friendship links with students whose mothers are college educated raises grade point average among girls, but not among boys. Additional analyses suggest a positive view of the school environment and a perception of one's self as functioning well in that environment as possible mechanisms. The effects are relatively broad based across students over maternal education, racial and ethnic composition, and across schools that vary in ==== composition.","Several studies exploit homophily to argue that social interactions are an important mechanism behind peer and neighborhood effects.==== Bertrand et al. (2000) find that residing near individuals who speak the same language raises welfare usage for members of language groups with high welfare participation rates. Bayer et al. (2008) find that individuals have better labor market outcomes when their immediate neighbors are similar in education, age, gender, marital status and age of children. Bayer et al. (2009) show that criminal peer effects are stronger when juveniles incarcerated together have similar criminal expertise. Hellerstein et al. (2011) find that same race and ethnicity employees at the same firm are more likely to come from the same neighborhood. Haskell (2015) finds that students who are more demographically distant from their peers engage in riskier behavior and have worse social and emotional outcomes. Billings et al. (2019) show that residential exposure to nearby peers who are the same age, race, gender and attend the same school increases the likelihood of committing a crime.====However, these studies typically do not have information on whether the individuals in the school or neighborhood interact socially, share information or have other contacts.==== In this study, we estimate whether having friends whose mothers complete four years of college affects a student's Grade Point Average (GPA) using one of the only data sets that both contains information on social relationships and supports quasi-experimental analyses of peer effects, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).==== Specifically, we estimate a non-parametric, reduced form model of within grade and school friendship links including fixed effects for school by each student pair's demographic type based on race and maternal education. Using the friendship link model estimates and the set of same gender-same grade potential friends, we predict the maternal education composition of each students’ friends so that, for a given student type, predicted friendship composition only varies across cohorts (or equivalently grades) based on across cohort variation in demographic composition. Critically, the fixed effect estimates used for one cohort of students omits that cohort from the estimation so that the predicted friendship patterns of the students in a specific grade and school is not influenced by the within grade friendship choices of those students. The across cohort variation in predicted friendships with students whose mothers are college educated is strongly predictive of actual friendships, and the prediction appears orthogonal to a relatively broad set of student demographics.====We regress grade point average on predicted friendship composition conditional on school-by-student-type and school-by-cohort fixed effects. This is a difference-in-differences model because predicted friendship composition is based on combining information on friendship patterns, the fixed effect estimates from the friendship link model (school by type), with friendship opportunities that are simply the population attributes of same gender, grade and school students (school by cohort).==== We find that having more friends whose mothers have four years of college is associated with better academic grades for female students.==== One additional friend whose mother has four years of college implies a 0.204 grade point increase in GPA, which is about an 8 percent increase at the mean GPA of 2.71 for all female students and represents a 0.25 standard deviation increase. A one standard deviation increase in the number of friends of this type is associated with a 0.17 standard deviation increase in GPA. We do not find statistically significant effects for male students, but the estimates are noisier and we cannot rule out friendship effects for males.====Our findings demonstrate that social interactions and relationships between individuals can be a critical component in generating positive or negative peer effects. In fact, our back of the envelop calculation suggests that friendships can explain 38 percent of cohort level peer effects for girls. To our knowledge, Carrell et al. (2013) is the only other study providing evidence that the effect of exposure to peers is highly correlated with the types or extent of social relationships facilitated by that peer environment. Specifically, they conduct an experiment where Air Force Academy students were assigned to groups intended to maximize the performance of the lowest ability students,==== but unexpectedly they find a negative effect on the treatment group, apparently because treated squadrons tended to self-segregate into subgroups based on ability. As with Carrell et al. (2013), we cannot prove that friendship patterns are responsible for the differences in grades because the demographic environment of a cohort of students that facilitates such friendships potentially could directly cause the effects on GPA. However, our model specification and other tests rule out traditional cohort level peer effects, even when those effects are allowed to be heterogenous across students.====Further, our paper represents one of the few quasi-experimental studies on effects of friendships on youth outcomes.==== Fletcher and Ross (2018) estimate large spillover effects of friends’ smoking and drinking. Lavy and Sand (2019) find negative effects on test scores of being separated from friends during a transition between schools.

Stringency is substantial when regulated heights are far below free-market heights, while stringency is lower when the two values are closer. Using ==== (the floor-area ratio) as a height index, theory shows that the elasticity of the land price with respect to ==== is a proper stringency measure. This elasticity is estimated for five US cities by combining CoStar land-sales data with ==== values from local zoning maps, and the results show that New York and Washington, D.C., have stringent height regulations, while Chicago’s and San Francisco’s regulations are less stringent (Boston represents an intermediate case). The paper also provides evidence on stringency variation within the cities.","The effects of land-use regulation have been extensively studied by urban economists. Gauging these impacts requires measurement of the scope of local regulation, and such measures have been generated by a number of different surveys of local governments, which tally the various types of regulations in place. The first such survey, by Glickfeld and Levine, 1992, focused on California and produced a count of the number of different land-use regulations used in a city. The count included regulations such as density restrictions (including building-height limits), limitations on the number of building permits, the presence of an urban growth boundary, and many others. Ihlanfeldt (2007) conducted a similar survey for Florida, generating another regulation count measure, and Jackson (2018) carried out a new California survey, generating an index more sophisticated than a simple regulation count but similar in spirit. Gyourko et al., 2008 carried out a nationwide survey of local land-use regulation. By applying factor analysis to the results, they generated the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index, which has also been used by many other researchers.====While information on the scope of land-use regulation is valuable, it does not provide an answer to a different important question. The question concerns the ==== of land-use regulation. A stringency measure gauges the degree to which regulations cause land-use characteristics ====. For example, in the case of building heights, the focus of the present paper, a stringency measure would capture the degree to which regulated heights fall short of those that would be chosen in the absence of regulation. If regulated heights are much lower than free-market heights, then regulation is highly stringent, whereas stringency is lower when regulated heights are close to free-market levels.====The literature offers two different approaches to measuring the stringency of land-use regulation. The first is due to Glaeser et al., 2005, who identify the gap between the price per square foot of housing and construction cost per square foot as a measure of stringency. This gap, which they call the “regulatory tax,” should be absent in an unregulated market, and its existence implies that regulations are restricting the supply of housing. Glaeser and coauthors compute the regulatory tax for Manhattan, showing that it is appreciable, but their method does not require them to identify the particular supply-restricting regulations that generate the tax.====The second approach, which is applied in the present paper, exploits the relationship between the value of vacant land and the extent of a particular regulation to gauge the regulation’s stringency. The approach, which is based on a precise theoretical result, relies on the intuitive notion that relaxing a stringent regulation raises land value per square foot by more than relaxing a less-stringent one (with changes measured in percentage terms). Since building-height regulation constrains development options, thereby reducing the developer’s willingness-to-pay for the land, it follows that relaxation of a stringent height constraint will raise WTP by more than relaxation of a mild constraint, a conclusion that is established formally in Section 2. Thus, to identify stringency, the log of land value per square foot is regressed on the log of the regulated building height and other covariates, and the resulting height coefficient (which is an elasticity) constitutes the stringency measure. Using extensive data on leasing (effectively sales) of vacant land in China, a study by Brueckner et al., 2017 applied the method to compare the stringency of height regulations across Chinese cities, made possible by allowing city-specific elasticities.====To apply the method in a context more familiar to Western readers, the present paper carries out the same exercise for several major US cities. As in Brueckner et al., 2017, the focus is on regulations that limit a building’s floor-area ratio (====), which equals the ratio of total square footage of floor space in the building to the area of the lot, effectively capturing building height.==== Land-value information comes from data on vacant land sales available from the CoStar Group’s commercial real estate website, and digital zoning maps are used to assign an ==== value for each sale transaction. The study includes land sales over the 2000-2018 period for five major US cities: New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Boston and San Francisco. The results allow the stringency of building-height regulation to be compared across these cities, while also showing how stringency varies across locations within each city.====The results are important because building-height regulations can distort urban form and raise housing prices. As shown by Bertaud and Brueckner, 2005, height restrictions reduce housing supply, pushing up prices and reducing housing affordability while creating inefficient urban sprawl as the city attempts to accommodate its population, effects that are all more pronounced the greater the stringency of the height limit. Height regulations have various justifications, including the worthy goal of keeping skyscrapers away from the White House and U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. and, in earlier days, the goal of limiting interior light reduction from building-induced shadows, an issue that modern lighting has eliminated (see (Barr, 2016)). In addition, by curbing population density, height limits can also reduce demands on urban infrastructure (streets, water, gas, sewage), a consideration that may have motivated the draconian ==== limits in India, which are studied by Brueckner and Sridhar, 2012.====It is not always clear that imposition of height restrictions is carried out with appropriate attention to the potential downsides of such regulations. Glaeser et al., 2005 and Barr (2016), for example, argue that by blocking further densification of Manhattan (a place that is already very dense), height limits impose a cost on New York residents by limiting housing supply. Given such concerns, it is important to know how the stringency of height regulation varies across cities. Cities with the most stringent restrictions could then be candidates for looser regulation. However, such a verdict must be viewed as incomplete since information about the offsetting benefits from height limits is missing, not being generated by the present methodology.====Measurement of the stringency of height regulations must confront a serious identification problem, a consequence of the fact that the ==== value for a land parcel is chosen by the local zoning authority. To see the problem, note that an attractive vacant parcel, with favorable values of unobserved attributes, will tend to have a high price of floor space once developed and thus a high land value, leading to a large value for the error term in a land-value regression. But since the zoning authority will tend to allow intensive development of attractive parcels, the assigned ==== value will tend to be larger for parcels with favorable unobserved attributes. The upshot is that ==== will be positively correlated with the error term in a land-value regression, leading to an upward biased ==== coefficient.====With instruments for ==== hard to find, Brueckner et al., 2017 addressed this bias issue by grouping observations (which were not geocoded) into clusters of parcels located on the same street.==== Unobservable attributes within clusters were then captured by cluster fixed effects, an approach that reduces the correlation between ==== and the error term in the land-value regression. When cluster fixed-effects were used, the estimated ==== coefficient dropped in magnitude, reflecting a reduction in upward bias.====A related clustering approach is used in the present paper. With the observations all geocoded, several different clustering strategies are used. The first is simply to include zipcode fixed effects in the land-value regressions. Since the observations are from dense central cities, zip codes are spatially small, ensuring that the parcels within a zip code are fairly homogeneous. An alternative approach is to group parcels into circular clusters with a fixed radius and land areas smaller than the average zip code. Clusters with radii of 1/8, 1/4, and 1/3 miles are created in alternate specifications, with the appropriate cluster fixed effects included in the regressions.====As in the Chinese study, inclusion of cluster fixed effects reduces the estimated ==== coefficients in all cities, indicating a reduction in upward bias. Nevertheless, the amount of remaining bias is impossible to judge. Even if some bias is still present, however, a comparison of regulatory stringency across cities (from comparing ==== coefficients) can still be carried out as long as cities share the same degree of coefficient bias, a pattern that would appear plausible.====In addition to estimating the coefficients showing (average) ==== stringency in the five cities, the paper carries out two additional exercises. The first, which relies on the theory, uses the estimated coefficients along with an assumed value for a production-function parameter to compute the ratio of regulated to free-market ==== values for each city. These results show the actual extent to which regulation depresses building heights below their free-market levels, even though the free-market values are unobservable.====Secondly, the paper explores variation in ==== stringency ==== cities. This analysis begins by investigating how ==== stringency varies with distance to the CBD. For each of the five cities, the ==== regression is augmented with a new variable that interacts ==== and CBD distance, with the coefficient indicating whether stringency falls or rises as distance increases. For New York, an alternate regression allows stringency to vary across the city’s five boroughs, showing stringency differences relative to the central borough of Manhattan. The second within-city dimension considered is distance to a subway stop, with the stringency effect again captured by a distance-==== interaction. Finally, stringency is allowed to vary with the income and racial composition of zip codes. These within-city results enrich the picture of ==== stringency that the paper provides.====The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a theoretical argument demonstrating that the elasticity of land value with respect to ==== is a measure of regulatory stringency.

A host of mechanisms responsible for this decline have been considered in the literature. These include highway construction (Baum-Snow,  2007), decentralization of low-skilled work (Kain, 1992), white flight from rising minority populations in cities (Boustan, 2010), rising incomes (Margo, 1992), mortgage lending “redlining” (Aaronson et al. (2017)), Federal Housing Authority mortgage insurance provision favoring the suburbs (Jackson, 1985) and vintage housing in cities filtering down to lower-income occupants (Brueckner and Rosenthal, 2009). While downtown neighborhood declines continued through the 1980–2000 period when measured in terms of population, they began to reverse when measured using demographic indicators including average household income and the share of the population with a college degree. In the 2000–2010 period, the average city’s downtown experienced both population growth and gentrification.====This paper emphasizes the importance of stark racial differences in amenity valuations of downtown neighborhoods and improvements in suburban labor market opportunities among those with less than a college degree for explaining the demographic stabilization and gentrification that occurred in central neighborhoods after 1980. Because 92% of downtown residents in the average metro area had no college degree in 1980, shifts in the spatial distribution of neighborhood amenity values and labor market opportunities for this group account for the majority of 1980–2010 demographic change and population dynamics in downtown neighborhoods. Our results indicate that rapidly declining 1980–2000 downtown populations were driven mostly by outflows of less educated whites and minorities alike, mechanically generating some gentrification through population composition effects during this period. Departures were driven primarily by improving suburban employment opportunities (relative to those in city centers), with an additional quantitatively important push given by declining valuations of downtown amenities. For 2000–2010, departures of less educated whites nearly ceased while those of less educated minorities continued unabated. Racial differences in both the suburban employment pull factor and valuation of downtown amenities drive the divergence for this later period. College educated whites and minorities both experienced newly increasing amenity valuations of downtown neighborhoods in the 2000–2010 period. But since only 14% of downtown residents were college educated in 2000 in an average metro area, this amenity force accounts for a small part of 2000–2010 downtown demographic change. Stabilization of 1980–2000 downtown employment declines after 2000 also played a small role in generating the reversal of downtown population declines.====Our evidence that the large reductions in rates of downtown population declines after year 2000 are mostly driven by changes in race-specific influences among those with less than a college degree is of particular note. As a baseline, our analysis shows that neighborhoods within 4 km of CBDs (central business districts) lost 33% of population on average across the largest 120 CBSAs in the 1980–2000 period because of changes in neighborhood choices, holding the aggregate race-education joint population distributions constant at 1980 levels in each CBSA (core-based statistical area). Holding these joint distributions constant at 2000 levels, central neighborhoods lost 10% of population on average in the 2000–2010 period. For 1980–2000, changes in neighborhood choices among those with less than college accounted for 31 of the 33% decline, split equally between whites and minorities. For 2000–2010, however, 8 of the 10% decline is accounted for by changes in neighborhood choices by less than college minorities, with the remaining 2 by less than college whites. These same patterns appear with greater magnitudes in neighborhoods within 2 km of CBDs.====The post-2000 racial divergence in both valuations of downtown amenities and labor market opportunities in other areas among those with less than a college degree account for these facts. For 1980–2000, all racial groups experienced similar rates of declining amenity valuations of downtown neighborhoods and improving labor market oppurtunities elsewhere, drawing them out of central neighborhoods. For 2000–2010, unobserved amenity valuations among whites with less than a college degree drove a 2 point growth in downtown population, offset by a 2 point decline among minorities. Changing suburban labor market opportunities drove a 1 point decline among whites and a 5 point decline among minorities.====Methodologically, our analysis proceeds in two stages. First, using a procedure akin to that proposed by DiNardo et al. (1996) for decomposing wage distributions, we decompose the sources of changes in demand for central neighborhoods into those due to secular demographic shifts, holding neighborhood choices constant, and those due to changes in neighborhood choices of various demographic groups, holding demographic shares constant. While our focus is on central neighborhoods, this method is broadly applicable for decomposing drivers of demographic change for any type of neighborhood, as is also discussed in Carrillo and Rothbaum (2016). In this portion of the analysis, we highlight the importance of the growth in minority population shares to counteract negative group-specific demand shifts for downtown neighborhoods, mitigating downtown population declines driven by changing neighborhood choices among all demographic groups. For 2000–2010, this force was sufficiently large to fully counteract the smaller within-group demand reductions to generate stable or growing downtown populations. Second, we estimate a standard neighborhood choice model to determine demographic group-specific changes in valuations of neighobrhood amenities and labor market opportunities. These estimates facilitate a unified decomposition of the extent to which changing labor demand conditions versus amenities in CBD areas and competing neighborhoods by demographic group explain the components of 1980–2010 central neighborhood demographic change that we attribute to shifts in group-specific neighborhood choices.====A number of other studies also examine the causes of downtown gentrification since 1980 in US cities. These studies primarily focus on forces driving the rise in college educated populations in these areas. Like this study, Couture and Handbury (2019) finds that rising valuations of downtown amenities is the primary driver of 2000–2010 increases in downtown populations of young and college educated residents. Couture & Handbury (2019) provides compelling evidence that changing tastes for restaurants and bars rather than food stores among the young college educated accounts for the largest component of these amenity effects. In contrast, Su (2019) examines the increasing importance of long work hours in high paying downtown jobs, and how this channel may interact with endogenous amenity production. Through estimation of a neighborhood choice model, Su (2019) demonstrates that the rise in long hours among high income occupations has drawn in population to downtown neighborhoods, where commutes to such jobs are shorter. However, he finds an even bigger multiplier that runs through the general equilibrium channel of endogenous amenity production. Edlund et al. (2019) provide further evidence that longer hours worked among skilled workers has promoted growth in downtown housing values and rents through a labor supply channel. Couture et al. (2019) propose a model that generates these endogenous amenity improvements and facilitates analysis of the welfare consequences of downtown gentrification.====Our emphasis on the importance of racial differences in amenity valuations and labor market opportunities, especially among those with less than a college degree, is driven by two features of the data. First, while indeed there were rapid 2000–2010 growth rates in young college educated residents near CBDs of many large cities, they came off of a small base. Therefore, changing neighobrhood choices of less educated individuals continued to be more important quantitatively for driving downtown population and demographic change. Second, these racial differences show up very starkly in our analysis. In the 1980–2000 period, less than college educated downtown residents of all races acted quite similarly. In the 2000–2010 period, the less than college educated whites living in downtowns began to act more like college educated whites. This change represents the largest force pushing the change in downtown population dynamics. Our results are consistent with observations in Gabriel and Rosenthal (1989) that whites and blacks of similar socioeconomic backgrounds have different revealed preferences for downtown and suburban neighborhoods. They are also consistent with Su's (2019) evidence of a quantitatively important endogenous amenity channel driving increased demand for downtown living, but one that is primarily relevant for all groups except minorities with less than a college degree.====A broad literature across the social sciences documents the “back to the city movement” (Sturtevant and Jung, 2011) and considers the consequences of urban gentrification (e.g. Hyra, Derek, 2008, Birch, 2009, McKinnish, Terra, Walsh, White, 2010). A necessary prerequisite to learning about the consequences of neighborhood change is to understand its causes. Florida (2002) and more recently Behrens et al. (2018) provide evidence that pioneer gentrifiers of many neighborhoods are the “Creative Class” and small businesses in the arts (such as artist’s studios and galleries) that may bestow positive spillovers on incumbents either by improving neighborhood amenities or by alleviating poor nearby employment opportunities (Wilson, 1996). The Kerner Report (Kerner et al., 1968), commissioned to provide policy recommendations in response to the urban riots of the 1960s, recommended establishing policies encouraging residential integration as a way to reduce the despair in “urban ghettoes”. With the difficulties many low income minorities face in accessing more affluent neighborhoods, a natural vehicle for integration is thus through just the sort of urban gentrification we study in this paper.====While, by definition, it improves neighborhood quality by some measures, gentrification may also be onerous for incumbent residents. Rising rents may more than offset any potential increases in local amenities as valued by low income incumbents; such incumbents may thus be strictly worse off in the presence of moving costs.==== The potential for urban gentrification to increase inequality has thus appropriately received considerable recent attention in the literature (Florida, Richard, 2017, Sampson, Robert, 2019). Our evidence is that incumbent minorities with less than a college degree had similar rates of decline in amenity valuations of downtown neighborhoods in both the 1980–2000 and 2000–2010 periods. This suggests that the 2000–2010 arrival of additional white college graduates into downtowns had little impact on amenity valuations for minorities, though it may account for the 2000–2010 rising amenity values by whites with less than a college degree. Moreover, we find scant evidence that 2000–2010 house price growth is responsible for pushing out many minority downtown residents. In summary, we find no evidence that the 2000–2010 flight of minorities with less than college from downtown neighborhoods was related to the arrival of college educated whites. Instead, if anything, our evidence is consistent with the reverse causal narrative. That is, prior departures of less educated minorities may have precipitated the arrival of college educated whites.====This paper proceeds as follows.

Defined as fiscal decentralization, this tendency is deemed an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of public goods and services provision, thereby fostering economic development (Oates, 1972; Tiebout, 1956). While the concept of fiscal decentralization was widely embraced by early theorists and international organizations such as the World Bank, empirical research has not reached consensus on a wide range of its potential impacts (see Martinez-Vazquez et al., 2017 for a survey). Recent studies highlight that the heterogeneous effects of fiscal decentralization may be because of the different ways the policy is actually implemented and the degree of political accountability in countries in which it operates (Mookherjee, 2015; Salinas and Solé-Ollé, 2018; Weingast, 2009). In particular, departing from full decentralization under which subnational governments possess autonomy to set both spending and taxes, many countries, especially developing countries, have pursued partial fiscal decentralization under which subnational tax autonomy tends to be low and local governments often have to rely on transfers from the central government to finance the provision of public goods.====This variation in the setup of fiscal decentralization policy leads to different incentives for local governments and thus different implications for macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes (Baskaran, 2012; Weingast, 2009). One criticism leveled against a partial fiscal decentralization setting in recent years is that the lack of subnational tax autonomy and reliance on transfers have become sources of local fiscal indiscipline by encouraging local governments to over-spend/over-borrow and/or lowering tax effort (e.g., Borge and Rattsø, 2002; Eyraud and Lusinyan, 2013; Rodden et al., 2003). Indeed, despite its relevance in much of the world, partial fiscal decentralization has received only limited rigorous treatment in the public economics literature and most existing empirical work fails to establish its causal influence or the mechanisms of impact (Bo, 2019; Borge et al., 2014).====More recently, researchers have focused on “natural experiments” in which relevant subnational governments experienced radical change in their vertical fiscal structure; by taking advantage of the institutional and time variation across subnational governments, it creates clearer identification setups to gain insights into the effects of partial fiscal decentralization (e.g., Borge et al., 2014; Salinas and Solé-Ollé, 2018).==== In a similar vein, we empirically analyze the causal effect of the partial fiscal decentralization stemming from a fiscal hierarchy reform in China on local tax enforcement (i.e., the degree to which local governments collect legally mandated tax obligations from companies and households),==== an area that has received little attention in the fiscal federalism literature. Recognized as one of the most typical partial fiscal decentralization setups in the world, China has maintained a hierarchical fiscal system with highly decentralized expenditure responsibilities and highly centralized revenue sources. Under this hierarchical system, there are five levels of government, with the immediate upper level directly managing its subordinate lower level (see the left panel of Fig. 1). Given this institutional setting, which we explain in detail in the next section, we exploit a fiscal hierarchy reform that eliminates the prefecture-level city (hereafter, city) in the fiscal management system and allows the provincial government to administer county governments directly (see the right panel of Fig. 1).==== By decentralizing hierarchical arrangements at the sub-provincial level, the reform devolves fiscal resources, particularly tax revenues and fiscal transfers, from centralized city governments to selected county governments to achieve the policy objective of improving administrative efficiency and lowering local fiscal difficulties.====The reform was initially implemented on a local pilot basis in some provinces in 2004 and then gradually expanded to other provinces nationally in the subsequent years. This quasi-experimental setting enables us to use reformed counties as the treatment group and non-reformed counties as the control group for the empirical identification. However, evaluating the causal effects of the reform is not straightforward because of the potential non-randomness in the selection of reformed counties. In particular, the reform could be targeted toward counties with lower tax enforcement. Such selection biases may hinder any direct comparison of reformed and non-reformed counties to obtain a real treatment effect. In addition, confounding trends in different counties make it even more difficult to isolate the pure treatment effect of the reform.====On that account, we employ the instrumental variables (IV) strategy to identify the impacts of the reform, taking into account the endogeneity concern of reform selection. Conditional on the decision of a province to implement the reform, we use the geographical distance between a county and its affiliated city to generate exogenous variation in selected reformed counties. This is grounded in the institutional fact that the reform removed authority and resources from city governments, which raised political opposition from this level of government. Indeed, this opposition was particularly strong when the authority and resources to be removed were from surrounding counties because the shorter the distance between a county and its affiliated city, the more integrated and inseparable is the market between the two, which makes it less politically acceptable for city governments to support the reform. It is therefore expected that the farther away counties from their affiliated cities, the more likely it is that provinces prioritize these counties to adopt the reform. We provide evidence from formal tests to show that geographical distance is indeed relevant for the selection of reformed counties and that this variable is unlikely to directly affect local tax enforcement, suggesting that it serves as a valid instrument for the estimations.====Our estimation results, based on a nationwide county-level panel dataset for 1995–2014, suggest that the fiscal hierarchy reform significantly reduced local tax enforcement (i.e., a county's ratio of total fiscal revenues to GDP). Consequently, the policy goal of the reform (i.e., alleviating local fiscal difficulties) is somehow undermined by the induced decline in county tax enforcement. Quantitatively, relative to non-reformed counties, the reform reduced reformed counties’ tax enforcement by approximately 1 percentage point. We then show that the net incentive impact of the reform is a result of two unparalleled driving forces brought about by the reform—the reform significantly increased both the local tax autonomy and the fiscal transfers of reformed counties, which induced different incentives on local tax enforcement. While the increased local tax autonomy motivated county governments to improve their tax enforcement, the increased fiscal transfers performed the opposite and dominant role in shaping the net negative impact of the reform on local tax enforcement.====Our analysis contributes to several strands of the literature. First, it adds to the analysis on the incentive effects of partial fiscal decentralization by exploring local government taxing behaviors. In such a decentralization setting, subnational governments tend to be less accountable when making fiscal decisions, as they have to finance their expenditures through fiscal transfers rather than their own revenues (Weingast, 2009). Early empirical studies sought to test this proposition by focusing on the overspending and overall fiscal performance of local governments (e.g., Aldasoro and Seiferling, 2014; Eyraud and Lusinyan, 2013; Jia et al., 2014; Jin and Zou, 2002; Rodden, 2003; Stein, 1999). Despite this evidence, little effort has been explicitly devoted to identifying the implications of partial fiscal decentralization on the other important side of local accountability—local government taxing behaviors. We thus bridge the gap in this regard.====Second, we contribute to the fiscal federalism literature by comparing the incentive effects of the two traditional financing methods for local governments (i.e., local tax autonomy and fiscal transfers) favored by decentralization theorems. In particular, to finance local governments, the first generation of fiscal federalism supported the use of intergovernmental fiscal transfers (Weingast, 2009). However, the use of this instrument may reduce local accountability because subnational governments can draw from the common pool of resources and take undue advantage on the tax enforcement of others (Bahl and Linn, 1992; Baretti et al., 2002; Eyraud and Lusinyan, 2013).==== By contrast, the second generation of fiscal federalism emphasized the importance of local revenue generation for financing local governments (Jin et al., 2005; Rodden, 2003). It argued that subnational governments with greater tax autonomy tend to be more accountable to citizens and have stronger incentives to increase their revenue by fostering local economic prosperity (Asatryan et al., 2015; Foremny, 2014; Groves et al., 1994; Weingast, 2009).==== Our findings lend support to this latter argument in the decentralization literature that improving local tax autonomy compared with increasing fiscal transfers appears to be a more effective way to finance local governments while strengthening local fiscal discipline.====Third, our work also adds to the literature on the determinants of tax enforcement in developing countries. To explain the relatively low tax enforcement in these countries, recent studies emphasize the roles of such external factors as the existence of a large informal sector (Gordon and Li, 2009), limited sources of information on tax collection (Kleven et al., 2011; Kopczuk and Slemrod, 2006; Kumler et al., 2013; Pomeranz, 2015), and the lack of tax enforcement technology (Kleven et al., 2016). Another strand of the literature stresses the political and fiscal incentives of local governments (Besley and Persson, 2014; Casaburi and Troiano, 2015; Chen, 2017). For instance, Besley and Persson (2014) argue that political agency directly affects decisions about the level and type of taxation, while Chen (2017) finds that the fiscal incentives of local governments, captured by the agricultural tax revenue loss in China, can be essential to local tax enforcement. Along the same lines, this study illustrates how the incentives implied by different fiscal institutions may shape local tax enforcement differently.====Fourth, we contribute to the limited but growing literature on evaluating the policy impacts of this fiscal hierarchy reform in China. The majority of research in this area has concentrated on the reform's impacts on economic growth and government spending patterns (Huang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2012).==== Our work extends these studies by examining its impacts on local tax enforcement. Given that the primary objective of the reform is to alleviate local fiscal difficulties, its induced (positive or negative) incentive effects on local tax enforcement would either strengthen or weaken the realization of this primary policy objective. In this regard, we also address the endogeneity issue of the reform. From a technical perspective, a critical but unsolved issue when existing work has examined the impacts of this fiscal hierarchy reform is that most contributions fail to address its potential selection bias. The instrument proposed in this study thus offers a potential solution for future studies of this subject.====Finally, we provide evidence of the “grabbing hand” of city governments in China's urbanization process. By explicitly showing the increases in tax autonomy and fiscal transfers in reformed counties, we supplement the long-standing argument that city governments tend to retain counties’ authority and resources for their own interests with empirical evidence. This also echoes the institutional fact of the overallocation of resources to urban development and underfunding of rural areas in China (e.g., Huang et al., 2017).====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background of the fiscal hierarchy reform in China. Section 3 explains the empirical methodology and describes the data. Section 4 presents the main empirical results and robustness checks. Section 5 analyzes the mechanisms of the reform's impact and compares the incentive effects of the two financing methods.

This approach models housing demand and supply based on the ==== without affecting household decisions. Quantitatively we find that the selective and re-distributive tax is more efficient in terms of generating sustainable government revenues and reducing vacancy rates.,"This paper explores the implications of alternative property tax and government spending regimes in China using a dynamic general equilibrium model. With continuing high house price relative to income in many cities in China despite an overall decline in the GDP growth rate, there is much discussion of the property tax as a mechanism to impose carrying costs on investors or to simply moderate demand. There is also a broader perspective which focuses on the creation of a sustainable fiscal system for local governments in China which have depended to a large degree on sales of land use rights.====We consider alternative supplements to the existing regime that depends heavily on land concession revenue, including: 1) a universal property tax; 2) a selective property tax targeting owners with multiple properties; and 3) a land value tax. Since land concession revenue is expected to decline, the diversification of revenue sources will place urban finances on a more sustainable footing while fostering financial discipline among regional governments.====In a general equilibrium model, the impact of the restructuring depends on how the tax revenue is used. We examine two alternatives: (i) a redistributive scenario where tax revenue is redistributed in equal amounts to households, and (ii) a non-redistributive scenario where tax revenue is spent on local public goods but has no impact on optimal decisions of households.====It is valuable to assess to what extent the introduction of a new tax regime impacts prices and whether or not it leads to a higher total revenue defined as the sum of land revenue and tax revenue. A dynamic general equilibrium framework is a suitable approach for the assessment. This is because it allows economic agents to respond to the new tax regime endogenously by re-optimization, which leads to the new equilibrium values of house price, rent, land price, land concession income and total government revenue.====In total, our study considers six tax and transfer schemes. It is helpful to evaluate different regimes from the viewpoint of three metrics which capture the main impacts on the Chinese economy. First, we consider the response of house price and rent to the tax regime switch. Second, we consider the changes and stainability of government revenue. Third, we consider the vacancy rate of residential houses after the imposition of the new tax and transfer scheme.====Regarding the first metric, we show that house price generally falls with the implementation of a property tax. House price declines between 5.16 and 15.68% which we report for universal and selective taxes in both non-redistributive and redistributive regimes.==== House rent also falls if the new tax revenue is not redistributed, but it may rise if the new tax revenue is redistributed evenly to all households, because the redistribution increases the disposal income hence the housing consumption of renters who are not subject to the property taxation. Such a positive tax effect can be substantial. For example, with a tax rate of 0.5%, house rent increases between 13.92 and 15.99%.====The implementation of a new tax regime leads to interesting transition dynamics. For example, after implementing a 0.5% redistributive land value tax, house price rises by 1.67% initially, but eventually it falls by 8.5% in the balanced growth path relative to the house price without the land value tax. The initial rise of house price is driven by the increased demand due to the increased disposable income of households originated from the redistribution of land value tax. However, housing supply also increases in response to the higher rent caused by the higher disposable income, dampening house price and land price, which eventually leads to the lower house price in the balanced growth path.====In terms of government revenue, a practical concern is that total revenue could be lowered by the switch of tax regimes. We quantitatively show that this is not the case and the new tax regime generally leads to a higher total revenue immediately despite the reduction in land concession revenue. The percentage change in revenue is significant, ranging from 31.82 to 184.43% in the two types of property tax schemes. Revenue changes due to the land value tax are less significant, ranging from 17.32 to 87.29%. Note that the introduction of the property or land tax is meant to provide an alternative revenue source to the land concession income.====Regarding the third metric, the vacancy rate of residential houses in China has been under intense debate. The ownership of multiple homes is common and the vacancy rate is high according to the China Household Finance Survey. It is widely speculated that some form of property tax would lower the vacancy rate. We quantitatively evaluate the effects of various tax schemes on the vacancy rate. Generally we find that tax policies are more effective in lowering the vacancy rate if the tax revenue is redistributed evenly to households rather than if the tax revenue is spent on public goods, because housing consumption demand is higher if households receive the transfers.====Taking the above three metrics into account, we find that the redistributive property tax imposed on owners of multiple homes is the most effective. It generates sustainable government revenue and reduces the vacancy rate. This tax and transfer scheme also leads to less repercussions in the housing market upon its implementation. The intuition is clear. On one hand, this policy increases the demand for rental houses as it benefits the low income households. On the other hand, this policy decreases the supply of rental units by discouraging the holdings of multiple homes. Consequently, house price does not fall substantially, thus land revenue is affected to a lesser extent. But house rent rises significantly, which motivates the owners of rental units to search for renters more actively, hence lowering the vacancy rate.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

How does a policy influence a generation in the long term? The literatures of economics, sociology, and psychology document the correlation between early life experience and later economic behaviour. In the literature of the Great Depression, Malmendier and Nagel (2011) find that macroeconomic experiences influence risk-taking behaviour. The generation that experienced the Depression tends to take fewer financial risks throughout the rest of their lives. They also display markedly lower consumption of durable goods, as shown by Romer (1990) and Crafts and Fearon (2010). Schoar and Zuo (2013) examine the managerial styles of CEOs who enter the labour market during a recession, and find that they behave more conservatively. Similar evidence is revealed in studies on the median or long-term effects of military service on corporate behaviour (Benmelech and Frydman, 2014) and war violence on changing political attitudes (Blattman, 2009).====In this paper, I use a new quasi-natural experiment, China’s rustication policy (programme) and three empirical estimations to investigate the long-term effects of adversity on financial behaviour. From 1966 to 1978, 17 million urban youths in China, mostly junior or senior high school graduates, were subject to a rustication policy and sent to the countryside to do farm work for an average of 3 to 4 years. With this shift from their privileged urban status to an unprivileged rural setting during adolescence, their financial behaviour is expected to differ from that of their peers. Previous studies have investigated the long-term influence of rustication on education and income (Deng, Treiman, 1997, Giles, Park, Wang, Xie, Jiang, Greenman, 2008, Yang, Li, 2011). Several papers examine its impacts on consumption or psychology, focusing on the dimension of home appliances and beliefs (Zhang, Liu, Yung, 2007, Zhou, 2013, Gong, Lu, Xie, 2014). Kinnan et al. (2017) link the rustication programme with later reforms to the household registration system and demonstrate that improved access to migration induces higher levels of consumption and lower volatility in rural China. Nevertheless, as a substantial change in identity during adolescence, when one’s beliefs about the world are being formed (Ghitza and Gelman, 2014), the influence of rustication on later behaviour merits further investigation. In this paper, I focus on its impacts on financial behaviour, and use findings on human and physical capital, working time, income, and beliefs to inform my investigation of the mechanism (Deng, Treiman, 1997, Xie, Jiang, Greenman, 2008, Yang, Li, 2011, Gong, Lu, Xie, 2014).====At its inception, rustication was compulsory for all age-eligible high school graduates. However, rustication quotas varied according to the economic situation and later policy changes. Two types of selection ensued (Li et al., 2010). The first was cross-household selection, as previously privileged families (such as the rich and/or educated) lost power in the social reshuffle and were less able to help their children gain exemption from rustication (Zhou, Hou, 1999, Li, Rosenzweig, Zhang, 2010). Second, when the quota was less than 100% (not all high school graduates were required to be rusticated), there was additional within-household selection: Parents had to choose which child(ren) was to be rusticated.====To overcome potential endogeneity, I specify two empirical strategies. First, I apply a twin fixed-effects estimation to identical twins from the 2002 Chinese Twins Survey, which is the first dataset on twins in China. This eliminates bias from a common family background. In addition, within-household selection is largely reduced in the specification for identical twins, as they are genetically the same and have far fewer differences than nonidentical twins or siblings who are further apart in age (Li et al., 2010). I also specify a robustness check to control for the difference between identical twins, using birth weight as a proxy for initial endowment (Rosenzweig, Wolpin, 1995, Behrman, Rosenzweig, 2004). Results remain robust. For the second strategy, I explicitly control for paternal socioeconomic traits as proxies for the family background in the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, using data from the 2002 Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP). The 2002 CHIP collects socioeconomic information on parents, including whether they live separately or are deceased. Thus, it largely overcomes the coresidency bias in conventional household surveys and controls for the first-order cross-household selection in rustication.====I find that individuals with rustication experience behave more conservatively than their age-eligible but nonrusticated peers. They spend less on the consumption of the largest household durable good, i.e., housing; spend a smaller share of total asset on housing; increase savings; accumulate more safe assets; and invest less in risky assets. Results remain robust even if the potential influence from spousal traits, cohort effects, initial endowment, and occupational types are considered.====In addition to the individual-level impact of rustication, I investigate the variation in rustication at city level by hand-collecting gazetteer data and manually extracting rustication information from 750 counties. Combined with financial behaviour data from the 2005 mini-census, I again find that the rusticated generation behaves more financially conservatively than the nonrusticated cohorts under a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy. These findings are consistent with the literature, in that individuals who have experienced economic recession tend to spend less on durable goods (Romer, 1990, Crafts, Fearon, 2010) and are less willing to take financial risks (Malmendier, Nagel, 2011, Schoar, Zuo, Benmelech, Frydman, 2014). Comparing estimates across three strategies, the OLS and DID estimates provide possible upper bound (less negative in magnitude) and lower bound (more negative in magnitude), respectively, for the true negative impact of rustication on housing consumption. The twin fixed-effect estimates lie in between and are likely the most reliable.====Why do rusticated individuals behave conservatively? I suggest three possible mechanisms. The first is reduced productivity associated with lost human and physical capital during the period of adversity. In line with the literature (Meng, Gregory, 2007, Xie, Jiang, Greenman, 2008), I do not find that rustication has a statistically significant influence on long-term income. Nevertheless, individuals with rustication experience work longer hours, which implies decreased productivity. As inferior economic status is associated with high risk aversion (Binswanger, 1981, Guiso, Paiella, 2008), less productive rusticated youths behave financially conservatively. Such findings are consistent with decreased educational attainment and physical capital following the rustication (sent-down) experience.====The second interpretation lies in the habits shaped during adversity, especially in terms of housing behaviour (Becker, Murphy, 1988, Orphanides, Zervos, 1994, Crawford, 2010, Costa, 2013). Given that past and current consumption of habit-forming goods are complementary, the habit of depressed housing consumption formed during rustication causes later consumption to converge to a low steady state. Empirical evidence examining the influence of the duration of rustication supports this explanation: The longer the rusticated period, the more likely it is to establish the habit.====The third interpretation lies in psychological change and self-discipline. Sent-down youths self-report that they learned about the toughness of life from their adverse experiences in rural areas (Zhou, 2013, Gong, Lu, Xie, 2014). An adverse experience is likely to motivate a conservative expectation about the future and enhance capacity to control negative emotions. Thus they show higher abilities in sadness/fear control and anger/disgust control than their nonrusticated peers. Busse et al. (2015) also demonstrate the psychological effects arising from projection bias on the purchase of durable goods.====My interpretations are consistent with the literature on the role of habits and values as determinants of behaviour and socioeconomic changes, such as the rise of the middle class during the Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism (Doepke, Zilibotti, 2008, Weber, 2013). Specifically, the second mechanism provides an explanation for financial behaviours that were present ==== the adversity, such as housing consumption. However, it cannot explain the financial behaviours that ====; for instance, investment in risky assets such as stocks. Nevertheless, such behaviours could be well interpreted by the first and third mechanisms, based on productivity and psychology, respectively. The three explanations are not mutually exclusive and do not exclude other possible interpretations. It is possible that various channels coexist and influence long-term financial behaviour concurrently.====Forced migration occurred in countries other than China, such as Greece, Poland, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Russia. The literature investigates its long-term impact on human capital investment, regional prosperity, and attitude (Becker, Grosfeld, Grosjean, Voigtländer, Zhuravskaya, 2018, Murard, Sakalli, 2018, Giuliano, Spilimbergo, 2014). However, none is comparable to China’s large population and age concentration.==== China’s rustication programme affected a population of 17 million with a demographic concentration on adolescents. To the best of my knowledge, this is among the first studies to systematically investigate the long-term impacts of this largest intra-country migration on financial behaviour, beyond its first-order impacts on education and income (Meng, Gregory, 2002, Meng, Gregory, 2007, Xie, Jiang, Greenman, 2008, Yang, Li, 2011) and rural development (Kinnan et al., 2018). Moreover, it occurred during the critical years of adolescence, when core attitudes and values are crystallised and hardly change afterward, according to the impressionable years hypothesis (Krosnick and Alwin, 1989). Thus this study contributes to the literature on the importance of macroconditions during a specific period in determining long-term consequences (Giuliano and Spilimbergo, 2014) and the effect of experiences in early life on adult outcomes (Heckman et al., 2013). It also sheds light on how a policy that pertains to those in the formative years exerts long-term impacts on a generation through changing behaviour. The policy implication lies in the importance of later policy interventions if policy makers take the long-term influence of such policies on financial behaviour into account.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background of China’s rustication programme. Section 3 presents three data sets, and Section 4 specifies the corresponding empirical specifications. Section 5 provides empirical results. Section 6 discusses possible mechanisms and robustness checks, and Section 7 concludes.",Does adversity affect long-term financial behaviour?

Using three datasets of U.S. cities and empirical distribution function statistics, I show that (1) the entire city size distribution is ==== lognormally distributed; (2) Zipf’s law does ==== hold generally; and (3) the power-law tail is robust. I then provide an alternative explanation for the observed fat tail: A mixture of lognormal distributions can generate a power law tail. In fact, this fat tail has its statistical origin in Shaked’s theorem. Finally, I provide an urban growth theory to explain how heterogeneous growth factors form a mixture that shapes the aggregate city size distribution.","There have been two intriguing empirical regularities in urban economics: City growth is proportionate (Gibrat’s law), and the city size distribution is fat-tailed (Zipf’s law, or the power law).==== Previous studies have shown that Gibrat’s law holds in general, and the entire city size distribution converges to a lognormal distribution. However, researchers—most famously (Eeckhout, 2004, Eeckhout, 2009, Levy, 2009)—have debated whether the upper tail of the city size distribution follows the lognormal or the power law.==== Although the difference in the shape of the upper tail might seem modest at first glance, I will explain shortly that distinguishing the shape has both important qualitative and quantitative implications.====In this paper, I settle the above debate and provide an alternative explanation, based in both statistics and economics, of the observed fat tail in the city size distribution. Using three datasets of U.S. cities and empirical distribution function (EDF) statistics to examine the shape of city size distribution, I reach three empirical conclusions: (1) The entire city size distribution is ==== lognormally distributed; (2) Zipf’s law does ==== hold generally; and (3) instead, the power-law upper tail holds robustly. I then demonstrate that this fat tail phenomenon could be generated from a mixture of lognormal distributions (the statistical origin), and this mixture could result from heterogeneous urban growth factors (the economic force). This explanation reconciles Gibrat’s law and the power-law upper tail, along with the above empirical results.====Why should one care about the shape of the upper tail? First, it has implications for how we understand cities. A fat-tailed distribution is qualitatively different from a non-fat-tailed one.==== A power law distribution with a tail index close to one implies that a few large cities account for much of the country; on the other hand, a lognormal distribution underestimates the number and size of very large cities.==== Indeed, economic activity is highly concentrated among a few large cities. For example, metropolitan areas in the U.S. account for 86% of the population. In the language of Gabaix (2011), economic activity is not made of a smooth continuum of cities, in which each city is flushed out in aggregate, but it is made of incompressible “grains” of cities whose impact would not be diversified in aggregate. That is, the debate between the power law tail and the lognormal tail reflects the fundamental difference between granular economies and representative agent economies. Urban theory for the city system needs to take this granularity into account as it points to different mechanisms.====Moreover, they are also quantitatively different in a qualitative sense because the aggregation properties are drastically contrasting. That is, urban policies or industrial policies that affect the sizes and economic activities of a few large cities might not be deemed as some “local” issues, as it may have profound welfare implications for the entire country. This is evidenced by Hsieh and Moretti (2019). They show that the housing supply constraints in the three large cities-New York, San Francisco, and San Jose-have induced a large degree of spatial misallocation by causing workers to refrain from moving to highly productive cities, thus lowering aggregate economic growth by 36%. In a quantitative analysis of an urban system, if one models the distribution as lognormal when the right tail instead follows the power law, then since the influences of the large cities are not captured correctly, the counter-factual analysis would also likely understate the impact of the large cities. For example, Duranton and Puga (2019) attempt to quantify cities’ contributions to aggregate growth. They argue that there would be large losses from restricting the population size of large cities due to a loss of agglomeration benefits. Thus, inaccurate categorization of city sizes would underestimate their contributions to growth.====In this paper, I first demonstrate that the debate between Eeckhout, 2004, Eeckhout, 2009 and Levy (2009) is misleading; it is based on the misinterpretation of statistical tests and improper use of low-statistical-power tests. I use the same Census places data as in Eeckhout (2004) and obtain the same number of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic: However, instead of accepting, it rejects the lognormal null. In addition to Census places data, I also consider CCA clusters in Rozenfeld et al. (2011)and Core-based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). All three definitions of cities reject the lognormal null.==== Furthermore, I find that Zipf’s Law does not hold generally but only holds for a particular data set and for a particular number of cities: the 100 largest metropolitan areas in CBSAs. The log-linearity (between size and rank) fails when I extend the range of the upper tail or use other definitions of cities. In contrast, the power law appears in a broader set of large cities across three definitions. The power law tail is also robust when I consider the spatial dependence issue.====The first purpose of the paper is to advocate for the use of the rigorous Cramér-von Mises type statistics to do goodness-of-fit tests and abandon the use of the KS statistic and ordinary least square (OLS) regressions when dealing with the size distribution. The Zipf’s law claim is controversial due to the misuse of OLS regressions-using ==== as a measure of goodness of fit-and visual inspection. First, we do not know if the model is correctly specified, and an incorrectly specified model can still have a high ====. Furthermore, the procedure of ranking already induces a negative correlation between size and rank, and this makes a high ==== less meaningful.==== Second, the ==== of linear regression has no statistical power per se. Third, a power law probability distribution has a lower bound, but the choice of this lower bound in the data is subjective in the literature.==== Using Cramér-von Mises type statistics could circumvent the issue of incorrect model specification, offer statistical power, and statistically determine the range of the upper tail.====The main purpose of this paper is to offer a simple explanation that reconciles Gibrat’s law and the power law-an explanation not yet considered in most of the economics literature. Cities can be divided into different types of growth rates, which are determined by heterogeneous growth factors. In this way, the aggregate size distribution can be viewed as a low-dimensional mixture of lognormal distributions; so, Gibrat’s law holds for each type of city. Compared to the mean-matched unicomponent model, this mixture distribution generates a fatter upper tail that can be well characterized by a power law. This statistical phenomenon originated from Shaked’s (1980) theorem. The estimated finite mixture model with four components fits the entire city size distribution well, and simulations from the estimated mixture model demonstrate the power law tail that exhibits patterns as observed in empirical data.====I then develop an urban growth theory to explain what city types are. The heterogeneous city growth rates are classified by different urban growth determinants. I consider three growth factors: productivity, amenities, and human capital. The aim is to show how heterogeneous growth factors affect the city size and form a mixture of lognormal distributions asymptotically. The theory also implies that the large cities in the upper tail are formed under the interaction of multiple growth shocks, so that the power law tail can be treated as multiple layers of the lognormal tails.====This paper adds on to the literature that attempts to explain Zipf’s law and the power law of cities. There are two existing popular explanations based on random growth. The first is random growth with a reflecting barrier, first proposed by Champernowne (1953) and adopted by Gabaix (1999) in an urban context. The second is random growth with death and birth, introduced by Wold and Whittle (1957) and adopted by Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2007). Both add some elements to Gibrat’s law (proportionate growth) to explain Zipf’s law. However, I show that Zipf’s law does not hold in general, and one could use a simpler mechanism to explain the power law tail. In fact, heterogeneity on random growth is enough to explain the empirically observed fat tail.====Heterogeneous city types are often used in urban economics (Au, Henderson, 2006, Black, Henderson, 2003, Henderson, 1974).==== The idea that a finite mixture model has a fatter tail has been used in the biology and ecology literature. For example, Allen et al. (2001) first propose that the power law distribution in some ecological variables can be attributed to mixing of lognormal distributions. Durlauf (2005) is probably the first economics study that acknowledges that heterogeneity can produce a fat tail in the size distribution of economic variables. This mixture idea is also related to Luttmer (2007), who demonstrates that a power law tail can be formed through a mixture of different industry-specific firm size distributions in a general equilibrium model.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains data, revisits the debate, and uses the EDF statistics to examine the entire city size distribution and the upper tail. Section 3 explains and estimates the finite mixture model. I then show that simulated data from the estimated mixture model demonstrate the power law tail that matches empirical data well. Section 4 provides an urban growth theory to explain city types.

We trace Mexico’s urban development over 450 years using detailed subnational data on population, locational fundamentals, and trade access. The analysis shows that urbanization patterns remained largely unchanged from the colonial period until the mid-20th century despite major economic shocks, such as the collapse of Mexico’s indigenous population, the War of Independence, and the ","History and geography loom large in the discussion of where and why cities emerge and grow. Geographic factors—the richness of soils, access to navigable rivers, the ruggedness of terrain, and other persistent features of the landscape—are thought to determine a location’s attractiveness for initial urban and economic development. Once established, areas of early population and wealth concentration may build on themselves over time through the benefits of local increasing returns, expectations of future investment, the positive relationship between economic development and well-functioning institutions, and other factors (Krugman, 1991, Davis, Weinstein, 2002, Bleakley, Lin, 2012, Henderson, Squires, Storeygard, Weil, 2018). However, major economic or policy shifts, such as industrialization or the opening of an economy to trade, may fundamentally alter the nature of geographic advantage. This paper examines how major changes in Mexico’s demography, economy, and society over the last 450 years have influenced the roles of historical precedent and geographic fundamentals in the country’s urban landscape.====Mexico constitutes an ideal setting to examine sources of persistence and change in urban development. It is a large and diverse country in terms of geography, trade access, history, and contemporary demography. Though some parts of the country have been urbanized for over 500 years, Mexico remained predominantly rural until the 20th century. In 1900, around 12% of the population lived in cities exceeding 15,000 inhabitants. Today, Mexico’s urbanization rate (80%) is similar to that of the United States. We use a combination of cross-sectional and panel methods to analyze population concentration at the level of 15-by-15-km grid cells generated over the territorial extent of the country. We begin by examining the correlates of urbanization at regular intervals from the 16th century until 2010 to identify which geographic features—agricultural productivity, elevation, ruggedness, and proximity to waterways, the northern border, and Mexico City—have been correlated with urbanization in different periods and how patterns of population concentration have shifted over time. We then transform the grid cells into a decadal panel to illuminate the timing of important shifts in urbanization patterns from 1900 until 2010 and their connection with specific economic policies and events.====The analysis shows that Mexico’s regional population distribution has remained largely persistent since the early colonial era, even in the face of major political and economic shocks such as the massive population collapse after the Conquest, numerous civil wars, the Mexican Revolution, and the creation of the modern Mexican state. Covariates associated with historical population, agricultural productivity, proximity to ports and to internal trade centers strongly determined city location from the colonial era to 1900. However, as the 20th century progressed, proximity to the coast and to the U.S. border become driving forces in the emergence of modern cities. The explanatory power of trade-related variables increases more rapidly between 1900 and 2010 than the explanatory power of locational fundamentals or historical population, highlighting important changes in the determinants of urbanization over time. The panel analysis reveals that the correlates of city emergence remained the same from 1900 until around 1950, at which point proximity to the northern border and the coasts began to play a more important role. The timing of these changes is suggestive of the role that economic policies favoring trade and tourism played in shifting population northward and towards the coasts at the expense of the center of the country. It is also probable that advances in transport and health infrastructure over the 20th century reduced the relative importance of agricultural productivity and the disease environment, enabling rapid urbanization in previously disadvantaged coastal and desert areas. While historical persistence has always been an important force in Mexico’s urban development, our work illustrates how policy has changed the nature of geographic advantage.====These findings contribute to ongoing debates in urban economics and economic geography over the roles of locational fundamentals and historical precedent in urbanization. Geography has long occupied a central place in the study of urbanization, as it has in the literature on economic development more generally (e.g., Pirenne, 1925, Weber, Martindale, Neuwirth, 1958, Bairoch, 1988, De Vries, 1984, Mellinger, Sachs, Gallup, 2000, Sachs, 2001, Nunn, Puga, 2012, Henderson, Squires, Storeygard, Weil, 2018). The relationship between urbanization and “first-nature” (resource abundance, agricultural productivity, waterway access, the presence of natural defenses, and the ruggedness of terrain) and “second-nature” (position relative to other areas of population concentration) geographic characteristics remains a central area of study. Recent work has focused attention on whether and why the relationship between geographic fundamentals and urbanization differs across time and space (e.g., Davis, Weinstein, 2002, Bleakley, Lin, 2012, Henderson, Squires, Storeygard, Weil, 2018). Our paper extends this line of inquiry by tracing the evolving importance of various first- and second-nature geographic factors over a long period time using subnational panel data. This approach allows us to more closely tie observed changes (or lack of change) in the geographic correlates of urbanization to specific policies and events, illustrating the shifting nature of geographic advantage under different levels of industrialization, transport availability, and trade politics.====The paper also speaks to the literatures on history and path dependence in urban economics. Past work has shown that historical precedent can shape the growth and longevity of cities in various ways. Areas of early population concentration may increase in size due to the benefits of increasing returns and agglomeration economies (e.g., Krugman, 1991, Krugman, 1993, Bleakley, Lin, 2012, Maloney, Valencia Caicedo, 2016), because of natural demographic growth from existing urban populations (Jedwab et al., 2014), or because existing cities serve as focal points for setting expectations about future investment and settlement (Bleakley, Lin, 2012, Jedwab et al., 2015). City locations may also be persistent if specific areas remain geographically advantaged over time (e.g., Davis and Weinstein, 2002). The notable persistence in Mexican population concentration from the early colonial period until the 20th century is consistent with each of these explanations, but 20th-century shifts in urbanization patterns call attention to the limitations of history-focused theories. While early colonial urbanization patterns proved resilient to some major shocks, such as the collapse of the indigenous population and the political transformations of independence and the Revolution, the rise of northern and coastal areas in the 20th century illustrate that economic policy can alter long-standing patterns of geographic advantage. By altering the benefits and costs of settlement and investment in different locations, trade and tourism policies increased the attractiveness of previously remote areas and reduced some of the advantages of places that had been well connected. This is consistent with other work on Mexico and other contexts highlighting the importance of trade and tourism in urban development (e.g., Redding, Sturm, 2008, Redding, Sturm, Wolf, 2011, Bosker, Buringh, van Zanden, 2013, Faber, Gaubert, 2019).====Our paper is most closely related to three recent papers on urban economics, geography, and historical persistence. Henderson et al. (2018) compare city development in early- and late-developing countries using nighttime lights data, finding evidence that inherent agricultural productivity has declined in importance for urban development over time due to improvements in transport technology. Like Henderson et al., our results suggest that the nature of geographic advantage has shifted due to changes in industrialization and trade, though our empirical approach is distinct. By using detailed panel data on population and geography within a single country over nearly 450 years, we are able to more closely examine the process of urbanization over time and link observed changes in the determinants of urbanization with specific economic and political factors. Our more granular approach also sets this paper apart from that of Maloney and Valencia Caicedo (2016), who document strong historical persistence in regional population concentration in Latin America using estimates of pre-Columbian population aggregated to the state or department level combined with contemporary data. Consistent with this work, we find strong evidence of persistence in population distribution over centuries using our more disaggregated measures of population. However, our work also highlights important changes in population concentration due to industrialization and shifts in trade policy. Our empirical approach allows us to identify the timing of these changes, and it has the additional advantage of not relying on subnational political divisions, the number and size of which have changed endogenously with population concentration (González Navarro, 1974, Unikel, 1976).====Our methodology is most similar to Bosker and Buringh (2015), who study the changing effects of geography on European city growth from 800 to 1800 using a similar grid-cell approach. As in that paper, our findings highlight the importance of first-nature geography in urban development and draw attention to the ways that the nature of geographic advantage has changed over time. Our paper differs from theirs most directly in our focus on specific policy changes in the modern era, especially those related to the evolution from internal to external trade. Though our focus on geography is similar, the specific correlates of city emergence in Mexico are somewhat distinct from those in Europe, drawing attention to the importance of broader economic and political context in urbanization.====A final contribution of this paper is to provide detailed evidence on the urbanization trajectory of a country as it grew from low- to middle-income, a little-studied path that remains open to the majority of the world but is not yet well understood. Urbanization tends to increase as countries develop, and population concentration raises the prospects for further economic growth (e.g., Overman, Venables, 2005, Jedwab, Christiaensen, Gindelsky, et al., 2014). Several scholars have argued that city emergence and growth in countries that urbanized early were distinctive from patterns now being observed in “late developers” in Africa, Latin America, or Asia (Overman, Venables, 2005, Jedwab, Christiaensen, Gindelsky, et al., 2014, Henderson, Squires, Storeygard, Weil, 2018). The extent to which lessons from urbanization in medieval Europe or the Middle East can be applied to understanding urbanization in contemporary developing countries is thus unclear. In addition to providing evidence on the geographic factors that influenced urbanization at different points of Mexican history, this work illustrates the role that policy can play in structuring urbanization and regional development in a developing-country setting.","Locational fundamentals, trade, and the changing urban landscape of Mexico",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300907,18 November 2019,2019,Research Article,113.0

This paper measures the knowledge creation consequences associated with the construction of China's high speed rail (HSR) network that connects mega cities, that feature the nation's best universities, to secondary cities. Since bullet trains reduce cross-city commute times, they reduce the cost of face-to-face interactions between skilled workers who work in different cities. Using a database listing research paper publication and citations, we document a complementarity effect between knowledge production and the transportation network. When connected by the HSR, co-author productivity rises, new co-author pairs emerge and more highly productive scientists migrate to the HSR cities.","Workers are more productive in high human capital cities (Moretti 2004; Rauch 1991). These cities offer greater learning opportunities but the knowledge spillovers are localized (Glaeser and Mare 2001; Rosenthal and Strange 2003, 2004). The localization of spillovers emerges in an economy where low transportation speeds limits who can interact with whom.====The most productive and ambitious workers often migrate to mega cities and then become even more productive through interactions and learning. Innovative activity tends to be more concentrated than industrial activity (Carlino and Kerr, 2015). This dynamic is playing out now in China (Glaeser and Lu 2018). As of 2016, there are 803 universities in China and 98% of them are public universities.==== This higher education system is quite hierarchical. The best universities are disproportionately concentrated in a small number of mega cities (Fig. 1-A). Eight mega cities (out of 287 prefecture-level cities)==== own 64% of the first-tier universities that receive favorable research funds from the State (called the “top universities” thereafter).==== They have excellent laboratories, libraries and databases and attract the best scholars and students (Freeman and Huang 2015). This human capital agglomeration process reinforces itself. On the other end of the spectrum, almost 100 cities (most are small cities) have no universities. The medium sized cities feature the largest count of average quality universities. Fig. 2 shows that this pattern of the spatial concentration of top universities in mega cities is much more prominent in China than in the US.====Such a spatial concentration of top universities generates a clear disparity in academic productivity across Chinese cities. During the years 2006–2016, more than half of peer-reviewed international journal papers were produced by scholars at the universities in the aforementioned nine mega cities (Fig. 1-B). If cross-city transportation costs are high, researchers working in secondary cities will have fewer opportunities to visit those mega cities and to interact with leading researchers there. Transportation costs also limit the ability of a talented professor at a top university to work with researchers with complementary skills who stay in another city.====This paper uses China's recent investment in the creation of high speed rail (HSR) network to test for the role of cross-city transportation speed as a key determinant of urban productivity. We study whether reductions in cross-city transportation costs facilitate matching and interactions between scientists. This process results in more and higher quality research ideas. The academic production process creates published papers and yields paper citations. This output offers us a quantitative metric for measuring the economic geography of research productivity dynamics and for identifying cross-city flows of ideas and teamwork (Jaffe et al., 1993; Henderson et al., 1998; Agrawal et al., 2017). While our empirics focus on university researcher collaboration and knowledge creation, we posit that the increase in cross-city transportation speed also facilitates private sector R&D as firms that site their labs in different locations can meet more frequently (Buzard et al., 2017).==== China's HSR allows individuals to move across cities at the speed of roughly 175 miles per hour. Such increased speed (a doubling of past train speeds) increases the menu of locations that have access to mega cities. By the end of 2030, the HSR network is expected to connect almost 230 Chinese cities in all provinces. These trains offer a high quality comfortable ride and greatly reduce the travel time of commuting across cities. The HSR fare is quite affordable, especially for university researchers.==== There are many pairs of cities such as Beijing and Shijiazhuang, Shanghai and Hefei, that are too far apart to drive and too close to fly. We test for whether HSR is associated with a larger increase in trade in ideas between these HSR accessible pairs of cities.====Using a data set of academic publications in the Web of Science (WoS, run by Thomson Reuters), we document that researchers working in second tier cities enjoy a productivity boost when their city is connected by HSR with the mega cities. We test for two main channels through which the HSR could cause a growth in city's researcher productivity.====First, HSR facilitates inter-city travels and face-to-face communication, and thus leads to better matching and interactions. In this age of specialized knowledge production, complex research tasks need to be completed by a team composed of individuals with complementary skills. Of all the papers in our data set, 97% are co-authored. Within a university or even a department, the spatial proximity of various researchers facilitates learning and spillover effects (Claudel et al., 2017; Bosquet and Combes 2017). A mega city will be the home to many universities so the local matching pool is larger. However, in this age of specialized research, even for the mega cities with thousands of researchers, the gains to trade knowledge may not be exhausted. In this sense, transportation costs between cities limit the ability of research teams to effectively work together, and the marginal benefits of connections to more scholars in other cities could be large. Although researchers can discuss ideas via email and Skype, such information technologies are not a perfect substitute for face to face interactions for these high-skilled workers (Gaspar and Glaeser 1998; Catalini et al., 2016).====High speed rail increases the travel speed across cities, and thus creates a larger local market for highly productive workers. Labor economists have modeled the search process such that workers and firms are matched through a matching function (Mortenson and Pissarides 1999; Helsley and Strange 1990). In the formation of new research teams, scientists who seek to co-author with other scientists face a search process for meeting and interacting. Major academic conferences in large cities can facilitate this matching process. New research teams may form due to better matching of researchers with complementary skills in a larger academic labor market. Such matching is facilitated by the increased cross-city travel speed. We call this channel the “extensive margin”. There is also an “intensive margin”. For those research teams that have already formed, high speed rail reduces the price of face to face interaction. This encourages such teams to work together more and perhaps to invest in pair specific human capital because they expect to interact more often in the future. If scientists scattered across universities in different cities can easily meet and interact with each other, then aggregate productivity increases.====The second mechanism is, the introduction of the HSR may shift the spatial equilibrium distribution of scientists across Chinese cities such that the marginal scientist who are now entering a connected HSR city is of higher quality than the average incumbent. Each researcher faces a locational choice tradeoff. The mega cities with top universities have excellent academic resources and a large pool of star scholars, but living costs (e.g. home prices) there are extremely high (Zheng et al., 2016). After being connected by HSR, those secondary cities with a reasonable commute time to the mega cities may gain by attracting more researchers to live there. The increase in cross-city transportation speed expands the “menu” of cities that researchers can consider when searching for a job. New doctoral graduates will choose which city to start their academic career. Productive senior researchers may have more bargaining power and freedom to change their job and move to other cities. This dynamic will directly increase the destination city's research productivity. In addition, there might be a second-order effect – the in-migration of productive researchers may generate positive productivity spillovers for the incumbent researchers in the second tier city.====Both productivity mechanisms will lead to the rise of city research productivity once it is connected by HSR. Our empirical strategy will mainly focus on the first channel, but our migration estimates offer new insights about the second channel. We are unable to explicitly decompose the effect into two independent components because they are inherently intertwining together in improving researchers’ human capital and productivity. We recognize that the Chinese central government is unlikely to randomly choose which cities to be connected by high speed rail. To address this concern, we implement an instrumental variables (IV) regression approach at both the city level and the city-pair level. Our two instrumental variables are both time-invariant, so we can only use them in our long difference regressions.====We find that after a city is connected by high speed rail, the city's academic productivity, measured by the annual production of academic papers, increases on average by about 9%−10% in both quantity (# of papers) and quality (impact-factor weighted # of papers) in the following years. At the city-pair level, higher travel speed facilitates matching and idea flows between two HSR-connected cities. We find that the productivity gains are largest for the subset of secondary cities located in the distance range that is close to a major city and does not merit a plane trip, but is also inconvenient for frequent short trips as those made within a single city. These are the types of city pairs for which the HSR is ideally suited for connecting cities.====Our finding that HSR connections increase cross-city trade in ideas and research partnerships has implications for the urban growth and human capital literature. Rauch (1991) and Glaeser et al. (1995) have assumed that human capital spillovers benefit the geographic area in question (such as the metro area or county) but do not spillover across geographic units. In contrast, our study highlights that the extent of the interaction across geographic boundaries is related to travel speeds. As travel speeds increase (and the cost of cross-city interactions decline), the stock of human capital in one area may increase economic growth in HSR connected cities that now have greater “labor market access”. In this sense, our paper contributes to the market potential literature (Harris 1954; Hanson 2005) and to research studying the geography of agglomeration (Kerr and Kominers 2015). The market potential literature has emphasized the earnings possibilities for a geographic area increases as a function of its proximity to populations with high incomes (consumers). In our setting, the productivity of scientists in smaller cities increases as their access to mega cities in China increases.====Our study builds on previous research investigating the consequences of HSR for different aspects of the Chinese economy. Zheng and Kahn (2013) document that this transport innovation is associated with rising real estate prices in the nearby secondary cities. Lin (2017) reports that an HSR connection increases a city's passenger count by 10% and employment by 7%. Industries with a greater reliance on non-routine cognitive skills benefit more from HSR-induced market access to other cities. Dong (2018) finds that cities connected by HSR experience an increased employment in travel-related sectors.====Our findings also have implications for cross-city inequality across China. In recent work, Austin et al. (2018) have examined the net benefits of place based policies for helping underperforming U.S areas grow. An alternative to such place based investments is to upgrade transportation connecting those areas to other markets. Since more people living in HSR-connected secondary cities directly benefit from greater access to the superstar researchers who work in the mega cities, high speed rail effectively reduces the sharp human capital inequality across cities and contributes to urban economic growth in the second tier cities.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the economic geography of HSR and knowledge production in China, and also provides some descriptive evidence of the main mechanisms.

To overcome the challenges that both the housing supply per land unit (which is a combination of quantity and quality measures) and its unconstrained amount are unobserved to the researchers, we extend the framework of Epple, Gordon and Sieg (2010) by explicitly allowing substitution between the quantity and quality inputs in the housing production function and by imposing a regulatory upper limit on the use of the quantity input. We show theoretically that the land share of the housing value can be used as a proxy for the stringency of the density regulation. We apply this method in our investigation of the stringency of floor-to-area ratio (FAR) regulation in urban China at the land-parcel level and find that the regulation imposes a significant binding constraint on the housing supply per land unit. We then explore the spatial and temporal variations of FAR regulation stringency. We also find that the FAR regulation stringency intensified the housing price appreciation that occurred during the economic stimulus period after 2008.","A large body of literature has focused on investigating the causes and consequences of government regulations that restrict the amount, location, and shape of residential development. (For a review, see Gyourko and Molloy, 2015). Empirical research in this literature has mainly dealt with the land-use regulations that are associated with the extensive margin of housing supply, namely, the supply of land for new development. For example, many studies have found that various growth-control policies in the U.S. (e.g., urban service boundaries, moratoria on new building permits, long wait times to obtain building permits) have restrained the amount of land available for residential development and thus have reduced the ability of housing supply to adjust to demand changes.==== However, in urban areas where housing sectors feature high-density built environments and the land supply is somewhat limited, understanding the effect of land-use regulations that restrain housing supply on the ==== the housing production ==== a given land parcel – is also crucial to the study of the impacts of regulations on local housing supply and local real estate prices.====Three research papers (to our knowledge) have rigorously investigated the effects of land-use regulations that focus on the floor area supplied per land unit (or building density). The pioneering study is Glaeser, Gyourko and Saks (2005a) which suggests that the gap between per-floor-area housing price and marginal construction cost for residential buildings in Manhattan can be used as an index of the extent to which regulations restrict development density below market levels. Brueckner, Fu, Gu and Zhang (2017) estimates the elasticity of land price with respect to density limit, and shows that it is proportional to the ratio of the unconstrained and regulated construction densities. Based on the estimates from a structural model of building density decisions made by private land developers, Cai, Wang and Zhang (2017) predicts the unconstrained density levels that would maximize land value and finds that these levels are much higher than the regulatory density limits in urban China, especially for land parcels in locations that are relatively more attractive. In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating the extent to which density regulation causes the actual housing supply per land unit to deviate from the unconstrained amount. Unlike the above three papers which measure the impact of density regulation on the floor area per land unit supplied, housing supply here is a combination of both quantity and quality. We contribute to the existing literature by providing a way to ==== measure the impact of density regulation on the intensive margin of housing supply.====Our estimation encounters two empirical challenges. First, because housing production combines both quantity and quality inputs, the housing supply per land unit is unobservable. Second, the housing supply in the absence of regulation (i.e., the unconstrained amount) is also unobserved. To overcome these challenges, we borrow Epple, Gordon and Sieg (2010)’s method to estimate the housing production function while treating housing supply per land unit as a latent variable. (We will henceforth refer to that study as “EGS”.)==== Further, we extend EGS's framework by explicitly allowing substitution between the quantity and quality inputs in the housing production function. The density regulation takes the form of an upper limit imposed on the use of the quantity input. We show theoretically that the ratio of the unconstrained housing supply relative to the constrained housing supply per land unit is positively associated with the land share of the housing value. As such, the land share of the housing value can be used as a proxy for the stringency of the applicable density regulations on the intensive margin of housing supply.====We use this method to investigate the stringency of floor-to-area ratio (FAR) regulations in urban China. A regulatory FAR level is a typical density restriction for land development that imposes an upper limit on the ratio of the total floor area to the lot size of the land to be developed. FAR regulations are common in both developed and developing countries.==== In urban China, as a major form of land-use regulation, FAR regulations are designated and implemented by each city's urban planning bureau at the land-parcel level. Using a unique data set of residential land sales data matched with residential development projects from 25 major Chinese cities, we estimate the land share of the housing value for each land parcel conditional on its regulatory FAR upper limit and locational amenities. We find that the land share of the housing value decreases as the regulatory FAR level increases: a one-standard-deviation increase in FAR limit (1.23) from its sample average (2.56) leads to a decrease of the land share of the housing value by 0.06, representing about 20% of the average land share (0.31). This provides evidence that the FAR regulation has imposed a significant binding constraint on the housing supply per land unit.====We then explore how the FAR regulation stringency varies across locations and over time. Our estimates show that, on average, the FAR regulation stringency in the coastal cities is higher than that in the inland cities. The regulation stringency in both these city types has been declining over the years. By relating each parcel's land share to the parcel-level characteristics, we find that larger land parcels located in more attractive neighborhoods are subject to greater FAR regulation stringency, although the regulatory FARs per se are higher for land developments located in more attractive locations. This suggests that although urban planners permit higher residential development density in locations with higher market demand, the gap between the planned density and its market driven counterpart still exists and it expands as one moves to more attractive locations within cities. Finally, we apply our stringency measure to a study of housing price changes. We show evidence that the FAR regulation stringency lowers a city's housing supply elasticity by investigating housing price appreciation across major Chinese cities during the economic stimulus period that occurred after 2008.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the model and the estimation specification. Section 3 discusses the background of land development and FAR regulation in urban China. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 reports the main results and shows the robustness checks. Section 6 explores the spatial and temporal variations in the FAR regulation stringency.

In sharp contrast to the literature on the US housing market, our analysis shows a large and negative housing price elasticity of consumption: a 10% increase in housing prices would lead to a 9% reduction in non-housing spending. We argue that the negative elasticity is driven by the combination of a strong investment incentive in housing and heavy borrowing constraints faced by households. This finding is corroborated by the fact that households increase their savings as housing prices increase. Our analysis suggests that the negative impact of housing price increases on consumption was an important factor behind the low growth rate in household consumption relative to the growth of disposal income during the sample period.","How does household consumption respond to changes in housing prices? Sinai and Souleles (2005) argue that because housing is both an asset and a source of housing services, capital gains to homeowners will be exactly offset by future increases in the cost of housing services. Given household optimization over an infinite horizon, their model yields consumption smoothing that is consistent with the predictions of the Permanent Income Hypothesis. While this approach forms the basis of our understanding of the consumption and wealth effects of home ownership, the prediction of no consumption response to house prices may not accurately characterize the behavior of many households.==== In particular, Campbell and Cocco (2007) show that with the addition of borrowing constraints, consumption responses are large and respond to the financial position of households. A number of recent US empirical studies identify meaningful positive consumption responses to housing appreciation (DeFusco, 2018, Aladangady, 2017, Mian, Rao, Sufi, 2013).====While positive consumption responses to housing appreciation have been well established in the US context, there is a lack of evidence from other countries.==== This gap matters especially in emerging markets, where the nature of household savings over the life cycle is likely to differ and has implications for a sustainable growth trajectory. In China, the contrast with the US is all the more conspicuous given the country’s staggering income growth and persistent high savings rate: the annual income growth in urban China was 11% and savings rates averaged around 25% during 2006–10 (Curtis et al. 2015). The role of housing is no less important in urban China, where housing accounted for 40.7% of total household wealth in 2011 (Gan et al. 2013), compared to 30% for US households in the 2010 Census.====In this paper, we utilize the universe of credit and debit card (bank card) transactions in China from 2011 to 2013 to examine the relationship between housing price changes and household non-housing consumption on a monthly basis across cities in China during its most recent housing boom.==== To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive city-level dataset on consumption and housing ever created for China. The bank card transaction dataset covers over 300 categories of consumption goods, which is complemented by urban monthly housing price indices at the city level.====This unique dataset allows us to account for an important margin of adjustment to housing price increases not fully captured in previous studies: a corresponding reduction of consumption driven by saving for housing investment. How can consumption fall amid dramatically rising income in urban China? The answer is that income growth is outstripped by housing price appreciation, which, in turn, is propelled by household demand and by private sector investment seeking stable returns.==== For Chinese households, a lack of access to the credit market can mean that home-ownership creates considerable financial burdens on households. This challenge is exacerbated by restrictions on the use of current housing for collateral effectively, which in other contexts acts as a channel for consumption increases (Fang et al. 2016).====To illustrate the channels through which these effects play out, we develop an intertemporal model of household consumption over housing and non-housing goods. When households do not face borrowing constraints, consumption smoothing occurs. We document, however, that when households face constraints on their ability to borrow against future income or against current housing assets (as is the case in China), permanent housing price appreciation generates consumption reductions when investment incentives outweigh wealth effects. We illustrate these channels in the form of a version of a Slutsky decomposition applied to intertemporal housing consumption. We also extend the model to consider how these effects vary across the life cycle and with adjustment costs.====A major challenge to analyzing consumption responses to changes in housing prices is the likely correlation between prices and time-varying unobserved local economic factors that could also affect consumption. These unobservables cannot be adequately controlled for by fixed effects. Therefore, we use a set of instrumental variables (IVs) that act as plausibly exogenous shifters of local housing supply. Our main instrument is the lagged volume (in square kilometers) of cumulative land sales in each city. This instrument is valid because variation in land sales during the period we study is primarily driven by local governments’ need to service debt incurred during the financial crisis, rather than in response to local housing or land market conditions (State Tax Administration 2013). To address concern about the validity of the strict exogeneity assumption, we apply a series of bounding exercises to our IV estimates, following Nevo and Rosen (2012).====Our analysis shows that the combination of borrowing constraints and a lack of investment opportunities leads to a ==== consumption response to housing price increases across Chinese cities, implying an elasticity of -0.9. We document this pattern across several consumption categories: a 10% appreciation in housing price would result in a 7.4% reduction in automobile purchases and a 6.2% drop in spending at supermarkets and department stores. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of negative consumption responses to housing price increases. While the result is the opposite of what has been found in the US and EU, it is consistent with a large body of literature that documents restrained consumption growth and persistent high savings incentives among Chinese households despite dramatic rises in income. There is disagreement about the underlying causes of this behavior: Wei and Zhang (2011) argue it is due to competitive marriage market pressures, while Chamon et al. (2013) suggest that it is linked to income volatility. Regardless of the cause, consumption reductions in response to housing price appreciation are consistent with the stylized fact of the high savings rate in China.====Our analysis of city-level aggregate household savings indicates that a 10% increase in housing prices is associated with a 1.9% increase in savings deposits, corroborating the fact that households that face tight borrowing constraints are deferring consumption to save for home purchases. Our ability in the paper to fully measure all margins of households’ adjustment is limited by not having household-level data; indeed, our unit of observation is limited to the city-month level. That said, our data is comparable to that of Mian et al. (2013), who estimate the elasticity of aggregate consumption for households that have different levels of wealth in the US.====We do not observe demographic information for cardholders. Given the high penetration of bank cards (debit and credit cards) during our sample period and our ability to control for changes in card penetration, our estimates provide a reasonable measure of average spending patterns across cities. In terms of differential effects among social groups, we examine heterogeneity based on city-level demographics. In addition, we identify homeownership status through an adaptive learning algorithm and compare the responses of ‘likely home owners’ with those of ‘likely renters.’ In both cases, we document heterogenous effects that are consistent with a model of consumption reduction due to housing investment incentives and borrowing constraints.====Our paper contributes to the literature on housing and household consumption behavior along three dimensions. First, as previously mentioned, existing studies that try to understand the impact of housing price changes on consumption behavior focus predominantly on the US. Our paper documents patterns that are in sharp contrast to those in the existing literature, highlighting the importance of taking into consideration capital market imperfections faced by households in developing countries and emerging markets. Second, our paper helps to explain the role of the Chinese housing market in the recent economic boom. Our analysis shows a negative impact of the housing market boom on domestic non-housing consumption. This has important implications given that China is trying to make the transition from export-led economic growth to growth that relies on domestic demand. Third, our study sheds light on the microeconomic basis for and the implications of the persistently high savings rate in China. The existing literature attributes this phenomenon to several determinants, such as the weak social safety net and the marriage market competition due to sex ratio imbalances. Our findings suggest that housing market dynamics are another important set of factors to consider when examining household saving behavior.====Our paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the context of the Chinese housing market boom. Section 3 provides a theoretical model that illustrates how housing price spikes could reduce consumption. Section 4 presents our data, Section 5 our econometric framework, and Section 6 our results.

We study the effectiveness of these efforts using the restrictions imposed by local Chinese governments in 2010–11 on the number of residential properties an individual could purchase. We use sales by developers of newly constructed units and exploit within city variation in the imposition of these restrictions to identify their effect on prices and transaction volumes. In addition to these direct effects on demand, we also identify the effects of these policies on supply using data from local government auctions of land to developers. Our results suggest that in the short run, restrictions on non-owner-occupant purchases significantly reduce activity levels by approximately 40%, compared to areas without restrictions. These effects diminish with time. However, there are no relative changes post-policy introduction in housing price between restricted and unrestricted areas. The results operate via end-user demand and not through the land market and the subsequent supply response by developers, as there is no relative change in either the number of land auctions or prices paid for land between districts with and districts without purchase restrictions following their introduction.","In response to dramatically worsening affordability resulting from house price inflation, local residents in some cities have targeted their ire at residential real estate purchases by non-residents. In these instances they blame external capital flows to residential real estate as a major cause of rising gap between local house prices and local incomes.==== Their anger is supported by recent theoretical work: capital inflows by non-resident purchasers who acquire residential real estate for capital appreciation or as a store of wealth, as opposed to for their own regular occupancy or to earn income from rents from regular occupants, can cause local house prices and rents to reflect larger asset markets and diverge from local labour markets.==== In response, governments in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, and Singapore have all placed higher purchase taxes on non-resident buyers. The United Kingdom and New York have adjusted the tax treatment of non-resident owners. In Switzerland, the number of units available for investor purchase is restricted. And in the summer 2018, New Zealand introduced severe limits on foreign investment in residential real estate.====Similar concerns emerged in China in late 2010 and early 2011 in the midst of a nationwide housing boom that grew from expansive policies following the world financial crisis. In addition to concerns by local residents about housing affordability, the Chinese central government was worried about asset price bubbles.==== Also, unlike the countries listed above, in China the main target was domestic rather than international flows. Beyond macro-prudential directives affecting mortgage interest rates, mortgage underwriting criteria, and access to mortgage credit, the Chinese government also directed municipalities to limit the number of properties a household could purchase. Targeting investors, these restrictions prevented buyers, depending on their residency status, from purchasing either a second or a third property.====In this paper, we test for the effectiveness of the purchase restrictions in calming the housing markets, lowering asset bubble risk, and improving affordability. Unlike the macro-prudential policies that were imposed on all significant cities and applied to all buyer types, the purchase restrictions were enacted with variation: some cities did not introduce restrictions at all, while others implemented restrictions that varied by district within the city. We exploit the within-city variation in the tightening policies of the Chinese market to evaluate the success of restrictions on investor demand in cooling housing markets and moderating rapid house price appreciation. Our identification comes from the standard difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, where the variation we exploit is across districts within cities, between new development projects in those districts with purchase restrictions and those without.====The contributions of this paper to understanding the effects of government actions designed to calm housing market stem from both a better matching of data to the identification strategy and from a supply side estimation using data from local government land auctions. In comparison with other work, we are able to execute DiD tests at a fairly granular level of geography, obtaining identification from the differences in changes between different districts within a city for sales by developers of completed units to buyers in new development projects, with fixed effects for individual developments. This allows us to better circumvent the bias problems from non-random treatment, because of the endogeneity of housing market conditions and policy actions, that occur with the cross-country or inter-city analyses of housing market interventions in the extant literature. We argue that any unobserved patterns correlated with selection (imposing restrictions) are likely to be more acute across cities than within cities because the latter category shares the same housing and labour markets.==== Our approach remains subject to problems with non-random treatment and inter-group differences because the allocation of district to treatment (restrictions) or non-treatment (no restrictions) is tied to the area’s distance from the city centre. While we believe this to be a less acute violation of DiD assumptions, our findings survive a variety of robustness and falsification tests that reinforce our claim that our approach is more consistent with the necessary assumptions of non-randomness inherent in the DiD methodology.====The second aspect that sets this work apart from others in the area is that we are able to test for supply effects.==== The land supply data yields results on local government and developer behaviour that serve to assess the price and volume effects in the apartment unit market. Data on land auctions enables us to test whether developers reduced their bids for land, consistent with an expectation of long-term decline in demand, or whether local governments reduced the volume of land and potential buildable floor area they introduced into the market, in which case local policy objectives would match the national priorities. Both allow us to ascertain more clearly whether the apartment market outcomes reflect changes in demand or whether supply side effects are also present.====We find that quantity restrictions have substantial immediate effects on transaction volume but no statistically different from zero effect on residential property prices. In the six months following the introduction of quantity restrictions, transaction volumes in the districts within a city that had purchase restrictions fell over 40% relative to volumes in unrestricted districts. Over time, this difference declines in magnitude, to 30% for a 12-month window and 24% for a two-year window. In contrast, the difference in the change in house prices pre-and post-policy between these two areas is not statistically different from zero over any period in our data. The results are robust across tests if we compare districts as a whole and if we use a border discontinuity approach and limit the sample to developments within a 3-km band on either side of the border between restricted and unrestricted districts. Falsification tests on using placebo dates and district boundaries for timing and location yield null results, supporting the argument that the quantity restrictions were responsible for the differences in transactions volumes. In comparison to our results, studies using cross-city panels find higher volume effects and find that residential real estate prices in cities with restrictions fall by over 10% when compared with cites without such restrictions. The results presented here suggest that some of this may reflect the non-random assignment of the restriction treatment.====The land supply tests on land auction prices and volume show no statistically different from zero differential changes in the number of land auctions, buildable area “supplied”, and the winning bids in these auctions between purchase-restricted and purchase-unrestricted districts between the pre- and post-restriction windows. Overall, developers did not change their bids for land in districts restricted post-policy introduction when compared with districts unrestricted, nor did local governments show any relative difference in the number of sites brought to auction. This is consistent with a no-supply response to the purchase restrictions.====We cannot unambiguously determine that the purchase restrictions in some districts lowered aggregate citywide activity. In using a difference in differences (DiD) methodology we identify relative changes, so it is possible that demand was just shifted from restricted districts to unrestricted district in exactly offsetting amounts. There is a net negative time effect, which normally would allow us to identify the aggregate effects. However, because citywide higher downpayment requirements and higher interest rates were imposed co-temporally with district specific purchase restrictions, we cannot rule out that the aggregate negative effect results from the credit restriction channel. Transactions fall in developments in restricted districts that are both better and worse substitutes (because of location) for developments in unrestricted areas so the aggregate decline does remain plausible.====There are a number of possible behavioural explanations for an outcome where in the absence of a shift in supply quantity falls but prices do not. If developers expect the restrictions to be loosened at some point in the not so distant future and their holding costs are low, then they would have little incentive to reduce prices rather than wait until demand recovers once restrictions are lifted. A related explanation is loss aversion behaviour by developers. The strength in the land auction market following the demand restrictions is more consistent with this first explanation than the loss aversion story. More generally, this outcome does suggest that in the presence of real estate demand booms, policies aimed at restricting demand may not be successful in the short to medium run at addressing affordability challenges, but can dramatically reduce market activity.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief summary of Chinese housing policies, focusing on the mix of measures introduced by the government in 2010 and 2011 with the objective of cooling down Chinese residential real estate markets. Section 3 is a review of the literature on policies to slow housing markets, covering both macro-prudential regulation and quantity restrictions, both in China and elsewhere. In Section 4, we describe the data used here as well as the identification strategy to test for effects. Finally, in Section 5, we present the results for price and volume effects at different levels of geography along with falsification and placebo tests for robustness.

Around 90% (or 100 million) of its ethnic minority population is heavily concentrated in the country’s lagging, peripheral areas.==== The concentration of ethnic minorities in these peripheral areas has led to important spatial- and ethnic-based disparities within the country due to their historically low economic and employment opportunities.==== The large spatial divisions (i.e. inland/coastal; rural/urban) in China are well-documented,==== along with the various attempts made by the government to redress the spatial inequality problem.====The extent of ethnic-based economic disparities, by contrast, is a comparatively much less studied topic despite the small but growing number of relevant studies pointing to their existence in both urban and rural areas.==== In the urban context, Ding et al. (2013) find that ethnic minority workers tend to earn lower average wages compared to their Han counterparts even after controlling for differences in human capital attainment. Subsequent evidence suggests that ethnic-based discrimination helps to explain at least partially why ethnic minorities earn fewer average wages compared to their Han counterparts.====The extent of these spatial- and ethnic-based disparities is considered to be growing over time (Gustafsson and Li, 2003), and a key driver of ethnic unrest in some parts of China (Howell and Fan, 2011). As a consequence, Chinese policy makers have intensified their search of economic policies to help improve the living and working conditions of ethnic minority workers. Minimum wage policy offers a potentially attractive economic policy tool that aims to help protect poor urban workers by redistributing earnings.====Despite its ambiguous welfare-generating effects in the literature,==== the minimum wage is a widely popular policy tool implemented in both developed and developing countries. In China, discussions about the minimum wage system are at the forefront of policy discourse as government officials try to curb growing inequality while balancing the need to maintain competitiveness.==== Existing studies indicate minimum wages in China have a binding effect on wages without negative repercussions on employment (Mayneris et al., 2014). Yet, the ethnic- and spatial- effects dimensions of China’s minimum wage policy, and broader implications for urban wage inequality in China’s ethnically diverse areas, are entirely overlooked by existing empirical studies.====This paper examines the distributional impacts of minimum wages on the wages of urban workers and the potential heterogenous effects of the policy on the urban wage distribution across ethnic minority versus Han counties (and workers). In addition, I also investigate the implications of the minimum wage policy for overall urban wage inequality in China’s ethnically diverse areas. To this end, I combine county-level minimum wage information with proprietary ethnic household data from the 2012 wave of the China Household Ethnic Survey (CHES) project that includes information on over 3000 ethnic minority and Han workers. A key advantage of the CHES data is that it offers the first and only authoritative source of information for both ethnic minority and Han workers that is nationally representative of China’s ethnically diverse areas.====I rely on a Generalized Quantile Regression (GQR) framework (Powell, 2015) to study the effects of the minimum wage institution on the unconditional wage distribution. To help with identification, I also combine additional county-level information obtained from various administrative data sources to take into account local labor supply, political favoritism and economic development conditions across sampled locations. The GQR framework is further extended to the instrument variable (IV) setting, which is used to assess robustness against policy endogeneity and measurement error.====The empirical analysis reveals the following main findings. First, a higher minimum leads to wage compression along the bottom part of urban workers’ wage distribution, with some evidence of positive economic spillovers. Second, minimum wage effects are larger for lower-skilled workers located in ethnic minority-dominated areas or that belong to an ethnic minority group, implying a reduction in the spatial- and ethnic-based wage gap across sampled areas. The heterogeneous effects are expected to arise, in part, due to a larger share of low-wage workers in these subgropus who are affected by the policy.==== Third, counterfactual analysis further reveals that minimum wages help to reduce overall urban wage inequality: increasing minimum wages from their counterfactual levels based on 2007/08 values to their observed 2010 levels, an average increase of 26%, results in a 10–12% reduction in the Gini coefficient of urban wages.====These findings are relevant and contribute to the literature in the following ways. First, I contribute to the relatively small literature on ethnic-based disparities in urban China (Ding et al., 2013; Howell, 2017; Howell et al., 2018), which typically ignore the potential role of public policies in addressing ethnic-based economic disparities and inequality. Second, this paper also contributes to the minimum wage literature, including the growing number of minimum wage studies applied to developing country contexts that typically exclude any ‘ethnic’ dimension in their analysis.==== The findings also relate to other minimum wage studies showing that the effects of the policy are heterogeneous across different locations (Jales, 2018, Caliendo, Fedorets, Preuss, Schroder, Wittbrodt, 2017),==== and across different subgroups of workers.====The outline of the paper is as follows.

Our objective is to provide an estimate of the school-quality premium based on the best available data. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we adopt the boundary-discontinuity design of Black (1999) and the matching strategy proposed by Fack and Grenet (2010). The results suggest that parents value public primary schools that have outstanding records in academic tournaments. The school-quality premium is highly non-linear. While a tournament superstar—a school above the 90th percentile in tournament performance—causes housing prices in its neighborhood to increase by 14 percent, or about 430,000 RMB, the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.","Chinese parents often say that they do not want to let their children “fall behind at the starting line.” Competition for places in the best primary schools is thus intense. As in the U.S. and other developed countries, admission to public primary schools in urban China is residence-based. But while homeowners and renters are treated equally in the U.S., the Chinese rule assigns a higher priority to homeowners. In practice, to send a child to a popular public primary school, a Chinese household must own property in the school's attendance zone. The extent to which this adds to skyrocketing housing prices in urban China is hotly debated.==== Yet little rigorous research has been done to estimate the school-quality premium in housing markets in China.====The objective of this paper is to provide an estimate of the school-quality premium based on the best available data. We focus on Shanghai, the most populous city in China.==== We collect data on housing transactions and tournament performance for 280 public primary schools in seven urban districts in Shanghai. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics that may correlate with school quality, we apply the boundary-discontinuity design (BDD) of Black (1999), as well as the cross-boundary differential model of Fack and Grenet (2010).====In the literature, it is standard to measure school quality by student test scores.==== In China, there are no standardized tests at the primary-school level, and to discourage harmful competition, primary schools are forbidden to publicize where they send their graduates. In this paper, we measure school quality by a primary school's performance in mathematics and language tournaments, which, in the absence of standardized test scores, has become an important indicator of school quality.====Using tournament performance as a measure of school quality has pros and cons. On the minus side, tournament performance may reflect exam-taking skills rather than genuine academic abilities, and, as participation in tournaments is voluntary, it may not be an accurate measure for schools where few students enter the tournaments. But on the plus side, tournament performance is publicly observable and, because winning a prize in a tournament can significantly enhance the chance of gaining admission to a selective middle school, the tournament record of a school may indeed be what many parents care about most.====The existing literature has shown that a one-standard-deviation increase in school test scores raises local housing prices by 2–4%.==== For example, Black (1999) finds that a one-standard-deviation increase in test scores in primary schools in suburban Boston is associated with a 2.1% increase in housing prices. Gibbons and Machin (2003) estimate this increase to be 3.7% for British primary schools. Using data on French middle schools, Fack and Grenet (2010) show that the increase is between 1.4 and 2.4%. See Table 1 of Black and Machin (2011) which summarizes the findings of previous research on the capitalization effect of school quality. Our estimation suggests that a one-standard-deviation increase in the tournament performance of primary schools in Shanghai is associated with a 2.4-percent increase in housing prices, which is in line with the literature. The willingness to pay for school quality, however, is highly convex. While a small set of “superstar” schools commands a very large premium, the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.====To capture this non-linearity, we divide the schools in our sample into four categories according to their tournament performance rankings: (i) above the 90th percentile (tournament superstars); (ii) between the 75th and 90th percentile; (iii) between the 50th and 75th percentile; and (iv) below the 50th percentile. Both the boundary-fixed-effect model and the cross-boundary-differential model yield similar estimates for the school-quality premium. According to the latter, a tournament superstar commands a premium of 14%, or about 430,000 RMB (65,000 USD, using the exchange rate of June 2016) compared to a school in the bottom half. However, schools between the 75th and 90th percentiles have a marginally significant premium of just 5%, while schools between the 50th and 75th percentiles have a premium close to zero. The results are robust to alternative measures of tournament performance and alternative cutoff levels.====A potential problem with the BDD is that households with heterogeneous preferences for school quality may sort across zone boundaries. In this case, the value of these traits would also be captured by the school-quality variables. Previous studies have shown that, in the U.S., households on the better-school side of a boundary have higher income and more education, and are less likely to be black (Kane et al., 2006, Bayer et al., 2007). One can try to control for neighborhood characteristics that may correlate with a stronger preference for school quality. In practice, however, one can never be sure that the list is complete. In this paper, we take advantage of the home-ownership bias of the Chinese system to address this issue. Rather than treating homeowners and renters equally, the Chinese rule assigns a higher priority to homeowners. Since renters inside the attendance zone of a sought-after public school cannot send their children to the school (see Section 2 for details), the average rent in a neighborhood should capture the value of all neighborhood characteristics other than the quality of the school. We find that all of our neighborhood attributes, including rents, change continuously at the zone boundary. This suggests that sorting by quality preference is not a serious issue in our boundary sample.====While school-zone boundaries are fairly stable over time, small adjustments do happen occasionally in the city-center area due to brownfield redevelopment or in suburban areas when new schools are opened. As corroborating evidence, we use a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy to estimate the price effect of a boundary adjustment. This quasi-experimental approach allows us to deal with the confounding effect of unobserved neighborhood characteristics.==== We find that, on average, moving from the attendance zone of a tournament superstar to that of a school in the bottom half reduces housing prices by about 13%, which is slightly smaller than the estimate in the cross-sectional analysis. Considering that households may worry about whether the adjustment is permanent, the DID estimate is likely to be biased downward.====Thus, both the cross-section and DID estimates suggest that there is a small group of “elites” among public primary schools in Shanghai. One possible explanation for this “winner-take-all” property is that tournament performance is valued only by parents who try to compete for places for their children in highly selective middle schools. To such parents, a better-than-average school that does not help their children to make the cut at a selective middle school may be of little additional value.====The high housing prices in Shanghai mean that few of the households who do not currently own properties can afford to buy one.==== The current policy of favoring homeowners, therefore, effectively excludes children of many poorer households from the best public primary schools. In an attempt to equalize access, the Chinese government has implemented a pilot program in another major city that gives renters equal access to public schools.==== Our research suggests that, in cities like Shanghai, where the willingness to pay for the best schools is very high, such a policy would be likely to substantially increase the demand for places at superstar schools, as well as the rent in their attendance zones. The policy would therefore benefit current property owners in the attendance zones of superstar schools. Whether it would benefit poorer households is less clear as households who can afford the current school premium are also likely to be willing to pay higher rents to send their children to superstar schools.====Previous attempts to estimate the capitalization of primary-school quality in China have focused on the differences between historical magnet schools (====) and non-magnet schools. Zheng et al. (2016) find that in Beijing, housing units in the attendance zone of a historical magnet school carry a premium of about 8.1%. Zhang and Chen (2018) find a historical-magnet-school premium of about 6.5% in Shanghai. Because the magnet-school status is dichotomous, it does not reveal whether school premium varies non-linearly with performance. Because the magnet school program, which began in the late 1970s, was phased out at the primary- and middle-school levels in the 1990s, a school's magnet-school status may not fully capture its current quality. For example, any school that opened after the program was abolished, by definition, cannot be a historical magnet school. Tournament performance, by contrast, may provide a more current measure of quality. In our analysis, after controlling for tournament performance, the premium for historical magnet schools is small and insignificant.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

This paper draws upon a quasi-natural experiment in China’s political hierarchy from the 1980s to investigate the effects of centralization in a novel sub-provincial setting. In this political hierarchy reform, China created “cities” from groups of rural counties and centralized counties’ political powers to the newly established city governments. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I show that centralization has positive causal effects on industrial productivity within the created cities. My analysis of industrial firm-level data reveals a reduction in the dispersion of marginal products, suggesting that centralization will help to reduce regional resource misallocation and improve aggregate productivity. A decomposition exercise shows that the gains are mainly contributed by extensive margin from entry and exit. I quantify the loss in productivity under decentralization by hypothetically reallocating inputs to equalize marginal products to the extent observed in centralization. Finally, he reform increases the concentration and specialization of production in space.","The role of political institutions in the process of urbanization and regional development has long been of interest to economists and policymakers (Henderson and Becker, 2000). Existing studies focus primarily on the consequences of democratization and political favoritism (Davis and Henderson, 2003). For example, Ades and Glaeser (1995) and Henderson and Wang (2007) show that democratization helps to limit the ability of a national ruling class to concentrate resources in the national capital. Chen et al. (2017) find that political favoritism helps high-ranking cities in China’s political hierarchy grow faster by paying a lower capital price. In addition to democratization and political favoritism, this paper investigates how another important dimension of political institutions, namely, centralization or decentralization of city government powers, affects urban industrial production and regional development.====In the last three decades, many countries in the developing world have implemented decentralization reforms (World Bank, 2000). However, while the degree of centralization is considered one of the most important dimensions of policy making, in the economics literature it remains an open question. Most recent work provides ambiguous theoretical predictions on its effects (Besley, Coate, 2003, Boffa, Piolatto, Ponzetto, 2015). Empirical evidence is also mixed, and most existing papers fail to establish a causal relationship (Bardhan, 2002, Mookherjee, 2015). Moreover, most empirical papers do not identify any clear mechanisms that might make either centralization or decentralization beneficial. In general, there is no clear answer about the extent to which a government should be centralized.====This paper aims to help fill these gaps in the literature by evaluating the causal effects of centralization stemming from a political hierarchy reform in China on regional development and quantitatively estimating the productivity gain. This hierarchy reform, first launched in 1983 and lasting until 2003, created centralized “cities” to replace decentralized prefectures. The aim of the reform was to speed up urbanization through more powerful city governments. Fig. 1 provides a simple illustration of the reform. Before it took place, county governments in a prefecture could make decisions on economic projects, public finance and personnel administration in their own counties. The central government realized the market fragmentation brought by such excessive decentralization and created prefecture-level cities to take the decision-making powers from the hands of counties. Authority in county governance was then centralized to the prefecture-level cities. In a word, the creation of the prefecture-level cities was designed to centralize the powers from the counties to the cities and accelerate development of entire cities. I exploit variations in centralization induced by this reform to examine its outcomes for regional development, mainly those outcomes related to urban industrialization.====I use the variations in the reform timings of different prefectures becoming cities to conduct a difference-in-differences (DID) regression as the baseline empirical model. Using prefecture-level data from 1983 to 2003, from the baseline regression I find that, after the reform, cities experienced increases in urban industrial productivity, measured in industrial output per urban population. The primary challenge of the DID strategy is the possibility that cities were not randomly selected into the reform. The central government did state requirements on the levels of non-agricultural population and industrial output in capital counties as selection criteria. Therefore, as it focuses on how the deviations from the level relate to changes in policy, DID is a reasonable strategy. To alleviate the selection issue, in the baseline regression, I follow Li et al. (2016) to control for the trends of the key criteria. Moreover, to formally check the identification assumptions, I follow an event study approach to confirm the lack of differential pre-treatment trends across cities. Another potential threat to the identification is spillover effects between treatment and control groups. I adopt the specification in Miguel and Kremer (2004) and find no evidence of the existence of spillovers.====In addition to the baseline findings on city-level industrial productivity, I use micro data of industrial firms to shed light on the mechanism. I apply the methodology of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) to measure resource misallocation using dispersions of “revenue productivity” (TFPR) and find that the centralization reform could reduce misallocation within cities. Then, I quantify the loss in aggregate productivity due to decentralization in a counterfactual exercise. This approach demonstrates the mechanism through which centralization may be conducive to economic performance. To further determine the source of the productivity gains, I perform a decomposition exercise to distinguish the benefits from existing firms or net-entry firms. The results show that the extensive margin contributes the most. I finally document the spatial pattern of this resource reallocation process. I calculate the ==== index developed by Ellison and Glaeser (1997) to measure spatial concentration of industrial production. The results show that the production in the industrial sectors became more concentrated in fewer counties.====This paper speaks to a broad literature. First, it provides novel insight into the debate between centralization and decentralization by showing that excessive decentralization is harmful and proposing a novel explanation: resource misallocation. Beyond the classical explanation that decentralization can cause externalities (Oates, 1972), recent work has placed greater emphasis on the political process. For example, while decentralization can avoid conflicts of interest (Besley and Coate, 2003) and the accountability problem (Seabright, 1996), it may induce a race-to-the-bottom competition between local governments (Keen and Marchand, 1997) and corrode state capacity by locally shielding firms from central regulations and tax collectors (Cai and Treisman, 2004). Some recent empirical studies in the context of China find that it will be associated with some loss in the environment and the safety of local workers (Jia, Nie, 2017, Shi, Xi, 2018). In this paper, I argue that decentralization can bring resource misallocation, a mechanism that has not yet been formally studied. In recent years, increasing numbers of papers have emphasized the great role of resource misallocation in explaining the disparities in aggregate productivity across countries (Restuccia, Rogerson, 2008, Hsieh, Klenow, 2009, Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, 2013), but few of them have quantified the contribution made due to different reasons of misallocation. In a recent study, Wu (2018) attributes capital misallocation in China to policy distortion rather than financial friction. The present paper explicitly illustrates the extent to which decentralization causes misallocation and reduces aggregate productivity.====In the specific context of China, decentralization from central to local governments is considered one of the main sources of economic growth (Xu, 2011), together with promotion incentives (Li and Zhou, 2005). Che et al. (2017) further studies the interaction between promotion incentives and the decentralization. However, Young (2000) argues against decentralization: local governments have incentives to distort the economy for rent-seeking by subsidizing specific industries, expropriating lands for industrial use or setting trade barriers. As a result, decentralization fragments the domestic market and leads production away from patterns of comparative advantage. Young (2000) observes two simple trends as suggestive evidence of the theory: the convergence in compositions of production across provinces and the divergence in prices, labor productivity and factor allocations. Poncet (2003), Bai et al. (2004) and Cai and Treisman (2006) have further explored the caveats of decentralization in China. However, to the best of my knowledge, no paper provides causal evidence on it. This paper offers rigorous empirical investigations for a solid causal relationship. In a related recent paper, Bai (2017) uses an export VAT rebate policy reform to identify the impact of internal trade barriers on TFP and misallocation.====Furthermore, my paper features a sub-provincial centralization experiment to enrich the existing literature. First, due to data availability, the previous literature mostly concentrates on “central - provincial” relations, referred to as “fiscal federalism” (Qian and Weingast, 1997). For example, since 1978, China’s economic miracle has been widely attributed by numerous papers to decentralization from the central government to provincial governments (Maskin, Qian, Xu, 2000, Jin, Qian, Weingast, 2005). Unlike them, I focus on the evolution of political powers between two sub-provincial governments. They represent governance entities in China but are left as black boxes in the literature without theoretical or empirical analysis. As far as I know, Zhuravskaya (2000) is the only paper with a similar “regional - local” setting, studying public goods provision in Russia.====This paper also contributes to the literature on the role of political institutions in urbanization and urban concentration. Urban economists have confirmed the importance of political institutions in determining urbanization and urban concentration (Ades, Glaeser, 1995, Davis, Henderson, 2003, Desmet, Henderson, 2015). Due to the significant role the government plays in the Chinese economy, scholars have offered empirical evidence in the context of China (Chen et al., 2017). In particular, the central government has implemented more “creating cities” experiments apart from the 1983 reform (Chung and Lam, 2004). For example, Fan et al. (2012) find that an upgrading-county reform to create cities actually fails to benefit counties’ economic performance. This paper reveals that a successful policy experiment to accelerate urbanization and industrialization should involve a better resource allocation within regions.====The paper shows that a centralized political institution helps to improve resource allocation and increase the concentration of production in space. Therefore, it helps to agglomerate people in central cities and shape a core-periphery structure within a region (Krugman, 1991). These findings then speak to the literature on geographic distribution of economic activities in China. Existing studies emphasize that transportation networks contribute to shape core cities and hinterlands in China (Faber, 2014, Qin, 2017, Baum-Snow, Brandt, Henderson, Turner, Zhang, 2017, Baum-Snow, Henderson, Turner, Zhang, Brandt, 2018). Together with them, this paper provides a consistent solution to the undersized city issue in China raised by Au and Henderson (2006): eliminating restrictions on migration and internal trade for better resource allocation.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 documents key features in the context of China relevant to my paper. Section 3 introduces the data. Section 4 introduces the basic empirical strategy used in the paper. Section 5 presents the empirical results.

We structurally estimate a trade model with endogenous migration decisions using data from 279 prefecture-level cities. The results suggest that inflows of ,"Over the past several decades, China has witnessed the largest wave of migration in history. Following the relaxation of the household registration (Hukou) system in the post-Mao era, around 340 million individuals (Chan, 2011) — roughly the entire population of the U.S. — have traveled thousands of miles away from their hometowns in search for a better life. Migration at this scale is bound to stir up controversy, and at the center of the debate lies the question of the local impacts: do the residents in the destination cities benefit from the influx of migrants? The local impacts matter because if the people in the receiving cities suffer from immigration, then further reforms on labor mobility will be politically divisive and morally contestable regardless of the potential gains at the national level. Unfortunately, the local impacts of immigration are often unclear. On the one hand, migrants bring prosperity to their new homes as they introduce fresh entrepreneurial ideas and increase labor supply. On the other hand, the new comers also compete with the locals for jobs, contribute to congestion, and push up the housing prices. In this paper, we study the local impacts of migration through the lens of a general equilibrium framework. We show that quantitatively, the benefits of migrants outweigh the detriments in the destination cities, and thus further liberation of migration barriers in China will improve not only the aggregate productivity but also the local welfare in the receiving cities.====To analyze the local impacts of migration, we introduce endogenous migration decisions into a quantitative trade model along the lines of Melitz (2003), Eaton et al. (2011), and di Giovanni and Levchenko (2012). In our model, individuals choose locations depending on the real wage and congestion dis-utility, origin-destination specific migration barriers, and idiosyncratic preferences. The real wage and congestion dis-utility in each city, in turn, are determined jointly with the population distribution across cities in the spatial equilibrium. The inflows of workers affect the local welfare in both directions. Migrants drive down the local welfare by depressing the wage rate and raising congestion dis-utility; at the same time, they also contribute to the local welfare by reducing the price level in the local goods market, as they dampen the production costs and induce more firm entry. Moreover, the local impacts in each city further depend on the migration flows into and out of their neighboring cities through inter-city trade. In the end, the local impacts of migration remain a question to be answered by the data.====We quantify the model to 279 prefecture-level cities in China in two steps. In the first step, we digitize the road, railway, and waterway atlas from the ==== and estimate the geographic frictions in moving goods and people across the country following Allen and Arkolakis (2014). Conditional on the estimated geographic costs, we then jointly estimate the other parameters using the Simulated Methods of Moments (SMM) in the second step. The parameters governing the migration frictions and congestion disutilities are identified by the data moments related to the bilateral migration flow matrix between 2000 and 2005, such as the city-specific inflow, outflow, and stay rates. The parameters related to the firm entry costs and internal trade costs are identified by the variations in the number of firms across cities and the volume of inter-city trade. We bootstrap the standard errors and show that the data moments can tightly pin down the parameters in our model. In the end, our estimation successfully captures both the targeted moments and several untargeted features in the data as well.====Our main finding is that the local impacts of migration are positive, and all the destination cities benefit from the population inflow. This result comes from the comparative statics between two spatial equilibrium in the year 2000 and 2005. Our benchmark estimation captured the condition of the Chinese economy in 2005 and the bilateral migration flows between 2000 and 2005. To counterfactually simulate the spatial equilibrium in 2000, we increase the migration frictions to revert the bilateral migration flows and thus exactly recover the population distribution in the year 2000.==== In both the data and our simulation, individuals migrate from the small and inland cities to the large and coastal cities, leading to a more concentrated population distribution across space. Over the five-year span, 40 out of 279 cities received net population inflow that is equal to 9.3 percent of their initial population. The influx of migrants has led to a 4.7 percent increase in real income among the 40 cities. At the same time, migrants also result in a higher congestion disutility that partially offset the gain in the real wage; the welfare in these cities increases by 4.0 percent after considering congestion disutility, suggesting the additional congestion costs account for ==== percent of the gain in the real wage.====The key mechanism behind the positive local impacts is firm entry and exit. The number of firms in each city is endogenously determined by the free entry and exit condition and is responsive to migration flows in our model. The inflows of workers 1) lower the wage rates and at the same time, 2) increase the demand in the local goods markets. The two forces both work to increase the expected profits of the potential entrants and lead to more firms and varieties in the local market, which is a mechanism commonly found in the trade models following Krugman (1980). Residents in the destination cities, in turn, benefit from more varieties at lower prices. In our analysis, the extensive margin of firm entry quantitatively dominates all the negative impacts, leading to the positive local impacts. The mechanism of firm entry is also the fundamental difference between our model and the model in Tombe and Zhu (2019). Using an Eaton-Kortum model without the extensive margin, Tombe and Zhu (2019) find a ==== relationship between population inflow and real wage, the opposite of our finding. To compare our results, we simulate another counter-factual in which we exogenously fix the number of firms in each city. The local impacts of migration turn ==== and the population inflows instead ==== the real wage and welfare in the destination cities in the “no entry/exit” simulation, indicating that the extensive margin of firm entry is the driving force behind our differences. To empirically examine the relationship between the inflow rate, the per capita GDP, and the number of firms in the data, we construct a model-based instrument variable for the city-specific inflow rates using counter-factual simulations following Allen et al. (2014). We find that consistent with our quantitative results, cities that received net population inflow indeed enjoy a higher per capita GDP and the number of firms in the data.====The local impacts of migration depend on the transportation network as well. We are the first to bring the comprehensive Chinese transportation networks — the road, railroad, and water transportation — into the analysis following the methods in Allen and Arkolakis (2014). These networks are essential to the local welfare in many cities, as the wage and price level depend on inter-city trade through the transportation networks. In the baseline estimation, the top beneficiaries of the internal migration are not the largest cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, but their neighboring cities. The neighboring cities enjoy the productivity boom in the large cities through inter-city trade, and at the same time, are spared from the surge of congestion disutility in the large cities. Such insights can only be obtained when the transportation networks are incorporated into the analysis. Moreover, the estimated geographic costs matrix among the 279 Chinese cities can be easily adapted to the other studies on the Chinese economy.====After evaluating the local impacts of the existing migration flows, we focus on the largest cities and evaluate the implications of the city-specific migration barriers. We first show that the most populous cities indeed enact additional migration barriers as compared to the national average. The barrier into Shanghai is 24 percent higher than the national average, followed by Guangzhou (13 percent) and Beijing (8 percent). The migration barriers result in a 0.7 to 3.9 percent loss in the national welfare. In the case of Beijing and Guangzhou, removing the additional barriers also lead to 9.7 to 18.6 percent gain in the local welfare. However, in Shanghai, the largest city in China, completely removing the barriers might not be desirable. Without the barriers, Shanghai will attract an additional 6 million migrants into the city, and the resulting surge in the congestion disutility dominates the gain in the real wage, leading to a 8.3 percent loss in the local welfare. The diverging impacts of migration barriers at the national and the local level highlight the political difficulty of further reforms on labor mobility. We also show that the largest cities in China are under-populated due to the restrictive migration policy, and relaxing those policies could benefit both the national and the local welfare, which echos the findings in Au and Henderson (2006).====Lastly, we show that the inter-city migration amplifies the welfare gains from international trade. We counter-factually simulate the model with a 10-percent reduction in the international trade barriers. The trade liberalization leads to a 12.7 percent increase in the aggregate income and induces 2.7 percent of the population to migrate, mainly from inland to coastal cities. The gains from trade are 55 percent higher than that without internal migration. Migration amplifies gains from trade through local wage rates. Without migration, the increased labor demand in the coastal cities following the trade liberalization quickly pushes up the local wage rates, which throttles firm growth in the local markets. With migration, the inflows of workers dampen the wage rates in the coastal cities, which enable further growth of the local firms and lead to higher gains from trade at the aggregate level. Our results add to the recent work on the gains from trade following the work of Arkolakis et al. (2012). We show that allowing for factor movements across space can amplify the gains from trade by a wide margin beyond what is often captured by the overall openness.====Our paper is closely related to the literature on the internal migration in China. Tombe and Zhu (2019) study the impact of migration on aggregate productivity. Fan (2015) studies the effects of international trade on the skill premium and inter-city migration. Our paper instead focuses on the local impacts of migration in the destination cities. To better answer the question of the local impacts, we deviate from the existing work in the modeling choices. Both Tombe and Zhu (2019) and Fan (2015) build on an Eaton-Kortum trade model which does not allow for firm entry and exit; we instead start with a Melitz framework that allows for such a channel. The extensive margin of firm entry delivers a strikingly different quantitative result as compared to the literature. With endogenous firm entry and exit, all the destination cities benefit from the inflows of workers. Once we shut down the extensive margin, our results revert back to those in Tombe and Zhu (2019) that the destination regions suffer from immigration.==== To this end, our paper highlights the overlooked extensive margin in studying the local welfare impacts of migration. Our second major difference from the literature is the introduction of geography. Tombe and Zhu (2019) focus on the province-level analysis and thus do not introduce the transportation networks into their model. Fan (2015) uses city-to-city distance as a proxy to measure the migration costs. We show that the local impacts of migration also depend on the relative location of the cities on the detailed transportation networks.====Our paper is also related to the broader literature on trade and migration, such as Artu et al. (2010), di Giovanni et al. (2015), Fajgelbaum et al. (2018), Caliendo et al. (forthcoming), and Caliendo et al. (2018). We build on di Giovanni et al. (2015) and introduce endogenous migration decisions similar to Artu et al. (2010) and Tombe and Zhu (2019). Comparing to di Giovanni et al. (2015), our framework is more suitable to study the endogenous response of migration to the small changes in migration frictions. On the other hand, we omit the effects of remittances in our model due to data restrictions. Caliendo et al. (forthcoming) also study the role of frictions in labor and goods mobility in a dynamic setting. They introduce a methodology to carry out counter-factual studies without estimating the level of labor mobility frictions. Different from their work, we model and estimate the migration frictions directly. We do so because we study the variations of the frictions across cities and the resulting welfare impacts, which depend on the ==== of migration frictions. Despite the static nature of our model, the computational load of solving and simulating the model is heavy, similar to most models following Melitz (2003) that allow for firm entry. We overcome the computational difficulty by implementing a new iterative Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our algorithm utilizes the solutions within a neighborhood to speed up the computation, and at the same time, avoids local minima by iteration. The algorithm can be easily implemented in parallel, which allows us to estimate our model structurally.====Lastly, our work is also broadly related to the literature on the Chinese economy (Chow, 1993, Brandt, Hsieh, Zhu, 2008, Hsieh, Klenow, 2009, Song, Storesletten, Zilibotti, 2011). We argue that despite the potential negative impacts on congestion, the residents in the large cities still benefit from the influx of migrant workers, and further reductions in the migration barriers are desirable. We also highlight the interaction between labor mobility and the export-led growth that is being pursued by many local governments. We show that lower frictions in the labor mobility will enable the coastal cities to better benefit from international trade, and lead to gains from both trade and migration.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

On average, roads that improve access to local markets have small or negative effects on prefecture economic activity and population. However, these averages mask a distinct pattern of winners and losers. With better regional highways, economic output and population increase in regional primates at the expense of hinterland prefectures. Highways also affect patterns of specialization. With better regional highways, regional primates specialize more in manufacturing and services, while peripheral areas lose manufacturing but gain in agriculture. Better access to international ports promotes greater population, GDP, and private sector wages on average, effects that are probably larger in hinterland than primate prefectures. An important policy implication is that investing in local transport infrastructure to promote growth of hinterland prefectures has the opposite effect, causing them to specialize more in agriculture and lose economic activity.","Between the late 1990s and 2010, China constructed an extensive modern highway network. We investigate the effects of this network on China’s economic geography. In particular, we examine effects on the spatial distributions of population, GDP, wages, and the composition of output around year 2010. Our investigation focuses on how highways’ promotion of improved access to regional domestic markets affects these outcomes and how these effects depend on a prefecture’s location in the regional urban hierarchy. We also separately consider effects of highways that provide improved access to international markets.====Our investigation faces three main problems. First, answering these questions requires making causal statements about the effects of the highway network. To estimate casual effects, we rely on plausibly quasi-random variation from the 1962 road network, a network that predates China’s transformation into a market-oriented economy and predates reliance on roads to transport goods between prefectures.====Second, we must measure a prefecture’s location in the urban hierarchy. To measure a prefecture’s location in the urban hierarchy we define ‘regional primate prefectures’ as the highest population prefectures within about a one day drive and ‘hinterland prefectures’ otherwise. The scale of this definition, ‘about a one day drive’, is determined empirically using a technique like those used to test for structural breaks in time series data. We also examine pure distance based measures.====Third, we must measure the relationship between the road network and market access. This raises difficult problems for estimation. Theoretically founded definitions of market access are fundamentally recursive. If improved access to prefecture B from prefecture A increases the size of prefecture A’s economy, then the converse relationship should also hold. However, this implies that shocks to prefecture A’s economy affect prefecture A recursively through prefecture B. This raises obvious challenges for the estimation of the causal effects of market access on local economic outcomes. This is a natural implication of general equilibrium, and in theory, can be solved with the specification of a correct structural model of the economy. Our contribution is to identify important stylized facts about China’s economic geography that such a model should reflect, and to a lesser extent, to point out that these facts are not obviously consistent with several widely used models of economic geography.====We skirt this problem by primarily considering measures of market access that depend only on the highway network. Specifically, to measure access to the regional domestic economy, we measure the quantity of highways within 450 km of each prefecture; and to measure access to international markets we calculate the minimum travel time to a major international port along the highway network. Since these measures do not depend on economic activity, they avoid the recursion problem. They also measure quantities to which policy makers can directly relate. Our various measures of market access are sufficiently highly correlated that we cannot empirically distinguish between the treatment effects of these alternatives.====In a robustness check, we report on outcomes in which we use the traditional gravity measure of market access which we call ’market potential’: the inverse of a travel time weighted sum of economic activity around a prefecture. Unlike our quantity based measure, this market potential measure allows connections to larger markets to be more important than connections to smaller markets. This intuitive property, however, does introduce the recursion problem described above. We also report on results using a market access measure derived from a Ricardian model of the sort now common in the economic geography literature (Donaldson, Hornbeck, 2016, Tombe, Zhu, 2015). However, since our work is not founded in that model and we wish to remain agnostic about the underlying data generating process, this is not the focus of our analysis.====To estimate causal effects of measures of access, we must address the possibility that regional roads are assigned to prefectures on the basis of unobserved determinants of economic activity. This is a conventional endogeneity problem, and for our highway network measures we address it by relying on quasi-random variation in the 1962 road network. To avoid the recursion problem, for instruments we rely on the same quantity based or travel time measures of roads. Because the instruments do not involve measures of economic activity, their use resolves the structural endogeneity problem that arises from the recursive nature of market potential and market access variables. However since, instruments do not vary with specification, we cannot distinguish statistically between our preferred road quantity measure of local access and a gravity measure.====Our investigation leads to one central set of findings. Improved access to domestic markets reduces prefecture population, GDP, population growth and wages paid by private sector firms on average, although GDP effects are not significant. However, these average effects mask differences in how roads affect prefectures at different positions in the regional hierarchy. The negative effects of better access to local markets apply only to non-primate cities. Regional primate prefectures exhibit positive offsetting effects for populations, GDP and wages with improved domestic market access. For example, a 10% increase in roads within 450 km of a prefecture city reduces non-primate prefecture population by 1.7% but increases primate prefecture population by 1.1% . As hinterland prefectures shrink with better access to domestic markets they become relatively more specialized in agriculture at the expense of manufacturing and services. These effects truly seem to reflect a prefecture’s position in the urban hierarchy. They do not reflect a prefecture’s rank in the national size distribution, whether the prefecture is a nodal point on the highway network, or a provincial capital. Finally we also look at the effect of better access to nine coastal ports. In general, better connections are associated with increased GDP and population for all cities regardless of position in the urban hierarchy.====Our findings suggest that the highway system has a profound and complicated effect on the economic geography of China. Overall marginal effects involve clear reshuffling of economic activity to relatively concentrate people in regional primates. With this migration comes an increase in output in the regional primates, manufacturing in particular, while hinterland prefectures shrink and specialize relatively more in agriculture.====As a large, developing market economy with newly constructed infrastructure, cities and regions in China exhibit the variation required to study the effects of roads on regional development. While much about China is unique, there seems to be no particular reason to think our results will not apply to other developing market-based economies. Extrapolating our results to other developing world countries suggests that expansions of the road network favor the rise of regional primate cities over smaller cities elsewhere in the developing world.====These results are important for several reasons. First, billions of dollars of transportation infrastructure are under construction or consideration in the developing world. About 20% of World Bank lending supports transport infrastructure projects, more than for poverty reduction. Moreover, with almost half of the population of developing countries now living in cities, and this share rising rapidly, a better understanding of the role transportation infrastructure plays in urban growth is central for informing development policy.====Understanding the effects of improved connections between hinterland cities and regional or other centers is particularly important in China. The 2005 Reform and Development Commission focused on the development of the road network well beyond 2010, with investments under titles such as ‘Developing the West’ or ‘Revitalizing the Northeast,’ while the 12th and 13th 5-year national strategic plans emphasize the development of poor hinterland regions through a vast expansion in road connections. Our results suggest that these policies may not help these areas retain population, but instead may accelerate their decline. While these migration responses may go along with overall welfare improvements, they are the opposite of what is intended.====Second, to our knowledge, we are the first to provide econometric evidence for an ‘urban hierarchy’ at the regional level. This finding has several important implications for the study of economic geography in general and transportation infrastructure in particular.====In a seminal paper (Krugman, 1991) and subsequent generalizations (Puga, 1999, Fujita, Krugman, Mori, 1999; see Ottaviano and Thisse, 2004, for a review), the literature has developed a two area model of economic geography with limited population mobility between the core (our primate city) and periphery (our hinterland cities) areas. A decline in trade costs may lead to an increase in core population at the expense of the hinterland. The idea in these new economic geography [NEG] models is that there is a home market effect which can be amplified some by population mobility. With high transport costs, producers in the periphery enjoy a degree of trade protection which is reduced when transport costs fall and periphery residents gain by importing certain products from the core, which they had bought before from local producers. The result is a shift of employment to the core, so its population and GDP rise. This modeling context applies well to China. Tombe and Zhu (2015) present evidence of low population mobility rates between regions in China and while there is greater between prefecture mobility within regions, migration remains very costly.====Existing empirical evidence on the effects of highways on economic geography in developing countries is mixed. For China, like us Faber (2014) concludes that rural (periphery) Chinese prefectures are hurt by better proximity to new highways. However, Banerjee et al. (2012) conclude that proximity to a highway or railroad is ==== for an average Chinese county. Ghani et al. (2016) find that India’s new highway network favored nodal cities while Redding and Sturm (2008) find that small German cities were more adversely affected by German reunification than large ones. We provide more direct econometric evidence for an ‘urban hierarchy’ at the regional level, and the contrast between core and periphery outcomes.====Our findings are also relevant for the theoretical literature describing central place theory. Central place theory originates with Christaller (1933) and consists primarily of the conjecture that in any given region there should be a dominant city, the ‘central place’, that produces a full range of goods for sale to smaller more specialized cities, which may produce goods for still smaller cities in turn. This conjecture forms the basis for a theoretical literature that attempts to rationalize this geography from formal foundations. As noted above, Krugman (1991) provides such foundations in a geography consisting of two discrete locations, while Fujita et al. (1999) and Tabuchi and Thisse (2011) develop specific general equilibrium models of such urban hierarchies along a line and around a circle.====There is a large literature which takes a different approach to examining the effects of national transport systems (e.g. Donaldson, 2018, Donaldson, Hornbeck, 2016, Alder, Sotelo, Allen, Arkolakis, 2014, Bartelme, Fajgelbaum, Redding, Tombe, Zhu, 2015, Balboni), including an early version of this paper (Baum-Snow et al., 2016).==== After experimenting with calibrations of standard versions of these models, we concluded that our results were not consistent with these models, as we discuss below. Fundamentally, the presence of an urban hierarchy appears to require either returns to scale that are important enough to permit multiple equilibria as in Krugman (1991), or else an important role for industrial specialization that depends on prefecture abundance of land or natural resources (or on an exogenous comparative advantage in manufacturing and service sectors). The recent literature generally assumes returns to scale are ‘small enough’ to rule out multiple equilibria,==== while land or natural resource abundance typically plays a small role in most structural models applied to transportation.====Thus, the focus of this paper is to establish facts about the impacts of the expressway system on China’s economic geography. Our object is to identify what forces determine the winning and losing regions from the reshuffling of economic activity caused by an expressway system. This is critical to public policy decision making and informs the consideration of modeling strategies that may rationalize our pattern of results.",Does investment in national highways help or hurt hinterland city growth?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119018300287,30 June 2018,2018,Research Article,126.0

Using panel data for England from 2006 to 2013 and employing a ==== strategy, we document that (i) rising national energy prices induce an increase in home energy efficiency installations and a corresponding reduction in energy consumption and (ii) this energy saving effect is significantly less pronounced in Conservation Areas and in places with high concentrations of Listed Buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency installations is typically more costly and sometimes legally prevented altogether. Historic preservation policies increase private energy costs and the social cost of carbon per designated dwelling by around £11,600 ($19,100) and £2,400 ($4,000), respectively. These costs ought to be weighed against any benefits of preservation.","Policies to preserve buildings for historical, cultural or architectural reasons are widespread across Europe and parts of North America. They generate both benefits and costs. While the external benefits—as measured by higher house prices outside of designated areas—have recently been well documented (Ahlfeldt et al., 2017; Been et al., 2016), we know little about the costs these policies generate. In this paper, we quantify the foregone energy efficiency savings and the corresponding social cost of carbon. We find that they are substantial.====The theoretical mechanism is straightforward. In the absence of historic preservation policies, households invest in energy efficiency improvements as long as the expected private benefits from potential energy savings exceed the additional upfront investment costs. Preservation policies drive a wedge into this decision because they often mandate restrictions on the type and extent of changes that can be made to residential units (‘dwellings’). Restrictions on say the types of windows that can be installed may increase the cost of adopting energy efficiency technologies or may legally prevent such installations altogether. Preservation policies may thus directly affect the energy efficiency of affected dwellings.====Our paper quantifies foregone energy efficiency savings by exploring the impact of historic preservation policies on domestic energy consumption in England. We focus on two well-established policies: ‘Conservation Areas’, which preserve entire areas of buildings and ‘Listed Buildings’, which preserve individual buildings. We collate a rich panel dataset at the neighbourhood-level (‘Middle Layer Super Output Area’), spanning the years 2006–2013. During this period, energy prices, defined in our paper as a local weighted average of national gas and electricity prices per kilowatt hour, increased every year but one, and per capita energy consumption fell by around 20%.====In Fig. 1 we plot a simple cross-sectional relationship, at the neighbourhood level, between per capita domestic energy consumption and Listed Buildings (per 100 dwellings). It indicates that more preservation is correlated with lower energy consumption. However, a naïve cross-sectional comparison does not compellingly identify the causal effect of preservation on energy consumption. This is partly because the prevalence of preservation is not randomly assigned across space. For example, Listed Buildings tend to be concentrated in older, richer and more urbanised areas.====One might try to overcome these endogeneity concerns by employing a panel regression with dwelling fixed effects. In such a model, changes in dwelling-specific energy consumption would be identified by changes in a dwelling's Listed Building-designation status (from 0 to 1), ceteris paribus. However, such an approach is infeasible because we only have cross-sectional neighbourhood-level data on the prevalence of historic preservation and because the vast bulk of preservation designations occurred before the 1990s. More importantly, it would fail to properly identify the full energy cost of preservation. This is because at the time of designation, the dwelling owners would have optimised energy efficiency, so the switch to designation (0 to 1) itself will not adversely affect energy efficiency and will not increase energy consumption. Only over time, as energy prices increase and/or energy efficiency technology advances, will the dwelling's original level of energy efficiency no longer be optimal and the preservation-induced constraints start to bite. Owners would then want to invest in energy efficiency improvements, yet the preservation-induced constraints would prevent them from doing so. This is what induces the energy costs of preservation and explains why our empirical approach focuses on changes in national energy prices over time, in a period of rapidly rising prices.====Empirically, we exploit the fact that rising national energy prices shift the local demand for energy efficiency installations upwards, thereby reducing energy consumption, but less so in areas with widespread historic preservation. We capture this effect by interacting energy prices with the neighbourhood-level prevalence of preservation at the start of our sample period. Our focus on ==== energy prices is therefore important for identification. When prices fall, there are no positive incentives to invest in energy efficiency improvements and the prevalence of historic preservation policies should not matter.====Using a fixed effects approach that controls for neighbourhood specific time-invariant unobserved characteristics, we first document that rising national energy prices induce a reduction in local energy consumption. Next, we explore the sensitivity of the price elasticity of energy consumption with respect to the incidence of historic preservation by interacting energy prices with the prevalence of preservation. In our baseline specification, we control for location and year fixed effects, linear time-trends interacted with neighbourhood characteristics as well as flexible trends for each commuting zone, and the neighbourhood's distance from the centre of the commuting zone. We also carefully control for the age and composition of the housing stock, thereby helping us to disentangle the effects of historic preservation policies from vintage effects.====We demonstrate that the energy-saving effect is significantly less pronounced in Conservation Areas and in places with higher concentrations of Listed Buildings. Using a conservative but plausible energy demand price elasticity point estimate (−0.48) obtained from the data, our findings suggest that a one standard deviation increase in the share of dwellings in Conservation Areas reduces the energy price elasticity by 3.5%, while a one standard deviation increase in the number of Listed Buildings reduces the elasticity by 4.4%. We provide evidence that the mechanism for this decline is the capacity of preservation policies to limit the uptake of home energy efficiency improvements.====In our empirical analysis, we face two sets of challenges that threaten a causal interpretation. Regarding the first set, a key concern is that the prevalence of dwellings in Conservation Areas and Listed Buildings may be correlated with income and other confounding factors. To address this concern, we first employ an alternative estimation approach, a ‘stacked regression’. This allows us to control for all factors that commonly affect per capita domestic electricity and gas consumption in each neighbourhood-year cell. Second, we directly control for the interaction between energy prices and a number of socioeconomic neighbourhood characteristics addressing, for example, the concern that higher-income residents may respond less sensitively to energy price hikes. Third, we add neighbourhood pair-by-year fixed effects to the baseline specification, where pairs are adjacent observations when ranking neighbourhoods on a number of candidate confounders (e.g. house prices or income), allowing us to control less parametrically for these possible threats to identification. Fourth, we employ a placebo test using a preservation policy—Green Belt designation—that does not focus on protecting buildings and is not expected to affect energy efficiency investments. This allows us to test whether our findings might be driven by factors such as general planning restrictiveness or local socio-economic characteristics that correlate with extensive preservation. All these tests support our main findings.====A second set of challenges centres on how we specify energy and historic preservation variables. In our baseline specification, we estimate the response of domestic energy (gas plus electricity) consumption to one year-lagged energy prices, weighting prices across the two energy types in our data. Yet, the timing of the response may not be lagged by one year. We show that changes in the panel frequency or in the lag- or lead-structure of energy prices do not materially affect our findings. A related issue is how we measure energy use. In addition to the stacked approach, which explicitly separates gas and electricity, we show that our baseline estimates are insensitive to using domestic gas consumption as the dependent variable, and to instrumenting for energy prices with North Sea gas production. Finally, we show that alternative specifications of our preservation variables do not alter our findings.====Counterfactual simulations suggest that preservation policies in England during our study period imposed additional private costs of energy consumption with a present value of £23.2 ($38.3)==== billion and a social cost of carbon of £4.8 ($7.9) billion. With two million designated dwellings, this equates to roughly £11.600 ($19,100) and £2,400 ($4,000) per designated dwelling, respectively. Limiting Conservation Areas and Listed Buildings to 1980 levels—a moderate reversion that would bring back levels to a point in time when dwellings with the highest heritage value were likely already designated—would have lowered total domestic energy consumption between 2006 and 2013 by 1.3%. This amounts to a monetary saving of £10.3 ($16.9) billion and a carbon reduction of 8.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.====Our paper ties into a recent literature on the house price effects of historic preservation. Ahlfeldt et al. (2017), like us, focus on designated Conservation Areas in England. They find that property price effects inside newly-designated areas are not statistically different from zero, yet outside of these areas, the effects are positive and significant. Been et al. (2016) explore historic preservation policies in New York City, also finding that properties just outside the boundaries of historic districts consistently increase in value after designation. The effect within these districts is more mixed; sometimes positive, sometimes zero. Been et al. also document a modest reduction in new construction in districts after designation. Finally, Koster et al. (2016) explore the impact of historic preservation within Dutch cities, finding that high-income households sort themselves into designated areas, suggesting that they have a higher willingness to pay for historic amenities.====While Ahlfeldt et al. (2017) and Been et al. (2016) both suggest that historic preservation significantly increases prices of nearby dwellings, this does not necessarily imply that they increase social welfare. First, as argued for example by Glaeser (2011), excessive historic preservation on a wider scale may generate adverse impacts through supply restrictions that raise prices in an entire city or even nationwide. Second, factors other than supply constraints can drive a wedge between house price capitalization effects and the public's willingness to pay (Kuminoff and Pope, 2014). Positive price effects also do not necessarily imply positive net benefits because even internal benefits and costs are not always fully capitalized into prices, for example, when the marginal house buyer is not well informed about particular benefits or costs associated with the location or dwelling (Hilber, 2017). Third, and most crucially, not all externalities are capitalised into property prices. One example is that some people may value the sheer existence of a historic building—such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris—even if they do not live close by. Our study highlights another: historic preservation limits energy efficient home improvements, thereby increasing energy consumption and generating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.====Our paper is also related to a growing literature on the energy and climate impacts of land use regulations. Glaeser and Kahn (2010) document a strong negative association between carbon dioxide emissions and land use regulations and point out that restricting new development in the cleanest areas effectively pushes new development towards places with higher emissions. Larson et al. (2012) trace the energy footprint of transportation, housing and land use policies, highlighting that, counterintuitively, minimum lot zoning may reduce energy consumption because it drives up the price of housing and causes household densities in the unregulated, inner parts of the city to rise. Finally, Larson and Yezer (2015) demonstrate that density limits and Green Belts can positively or negatively affect both city welfare and energy use. Our contribution to this literature is the careful empirical identification of energy consumption effects of historic preservation policies. To our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate and quantify the energy and climate costs of such policies.====Our findings have important implications for climate policy. In the UK, this is guided by the 2008 Climate Change Act, which legislates for an ambitious 100% (or ‘net zero’) reduction in GHG emissions by 2050. The ‘least-cost path’ to this target entails a major contribution from energy efficiency improvements in buildings, including designated dwellings. Our findings indicate that the extent of historic preservation in England signifies a considerable obstacle to achieving such an ambitious target. More generally, by demonstrating that preservation limits the uptake of home energy efficiency improvements, we contribute to a literature that seeks to understand the low apparent uptake of energy efficient durables (Allcott and Greenstone, 2012; Fowlie et al., 2015). Finally, another measure by which the UK hopes to meet its target is via a carbon tax, known as the Carbon Floor Price. Currently frozen at £18 ($30) per metric ton of carbon dioxide, this is projected to increase 'rapidly' after 2020. Our results suggest that individuals living in designated dwellings are unlikely to respond to a rising tax in the same manner as those living in non-designated dwellings.====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the institutional setting and provide some theoretical considerations. The subsequent section describes the data, discusses our baseline specifications and presents our main results along with robustness checks and evidence of the proposed mechanism driving the results. In Section 4 we conduct a counterfactual analysis to provide a quantitative interpretation of our findings. Section 5 considers welfare implications. The final section concludes.",The energy costs of historic preservation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300749,7 November 2019,2019,Research Article,131.0

Shops tend to be concentrated either in pedestrian shopping streets and shopping districts, often located in city centres, or in shopping malls in the suburbs. In Europe, shops are mostly concentrated in pedestrian streets. Walking in those streets is so important that the majority of all pedestrian movements occur while shopping.====Arguably, the most important reason for retail firms to cluster is the presence of positive shopping externalities, which are generated by consumers’ ‘trip-chaining’ behaviour. Shopping externalities have a simple logic. In retail markets where customers have to visit stores, transportation costs are paid by customers and incurred on a shopping trip basis (Claycombe, 1991). Consumers who visit several shops benefit from reductions in transport and search costs. In the context of shopping streets, a retail firm’s productivity function depends on local footfall – the number of pedestrians that pass by a shop. Footfall tends to be higher in areas with more shops, since pedestrians are attracted to areas with many shops. Hence, the associated reductions in costs for consumers imply a positive shopping externality for retail firms, which is enhanced when multiple retail firms are located in close proximity (Eaton, Lipsey, 1982, Claycombe, 1991, Schulz, Stahl, 1996). Similar to other agglomeration advantages, these shopping externalities are expected to capitalise into store owners’ rental income.====In the empirical literature, however, little attention has been given to the importance of shopping externalities. The few studies that measure shopping externalities focus on U.S. shopping malls (see Pashigian and Gould, 1998). However, retail activity in European cities is mainly concentrated in shopping streets while shopping malls are far less common.==== To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that quantifies shopping externalities in shopping streets.====Shopping streets are characterised by a different form of retail organisation than shopping malls. In contrast to shopping malls, we will show that property ownership in shopping streets is highly fragmented and that each shop is only a minor player locally. As a consequence, internalisation of shopping externalities is unlikely to occur in shopping streets.==== Thus, public policies that foster retail concentration by providing subsidies are potentially welfare improving.====We focus on the full population of main shopping streets in one country: the Netherlands. An important feature of shopping streets is that they are dominated by clothing stores (30%), cafés/restaurants (16%) and food stores (10%). The main strategy followed by the retail firms in these sectors is to differentiate themselves by supplying heterogeneous products. This is in sharp contrast to other retail sectors that are examined in the economic literature, which offer homogeneous products and where spatial differentiation is the main strategy (==== gas stations, movie theatres, or video retailers, see Netz, Taylor, 2002, Davis, 2006, Seim, 2006, respectively).====We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we employ two measures of shopping externalities. Our first measure, ====, is novel in the agglomeration literature.==== We will argue that footfall captures shopping externalities rather precisely, also because measures of footfall predominantly include shoppers who visit several shops. As a second measure of shopping externalities we use the number of shops in the vicinity. The latter is a more standard proxy for externalities, which is in line with a large literature on agglomeration economies (see ==== Combes, Duranton, Gobillon, 2008, Melo, Graham, Noland, 2009).====A second contribution of the paper lies in an explicit treatment of heterogeneity. One may suspect that there is heterogeneity in the benefits of shopping externalities. For example, shops that are part of a chain are more likely to locate in streets with high levels of footfall. Using semi-parametric regression techniques we show that heterogeneity between firms in terms of ==== willingness to pay for footfall is limited. For example, shops belong to chains and other shops have roughly the same marginal willingness to pay for footfall. Note that this suggests that store owners cannot, or do not, discriminate between different types of retail firms in setting the rent.====The third, and main, contribution of the current paper is the identification of shopping externalities by estimating the causal effect of footfall on the rental income of store owners, which we derive by estimating the causal effects of footfall on the rent paid by tenants as well as on the probability that a retail property lies empty. We will address several sources of endogeneity by exploiting spatial variation within shopping streets, combined with the use of a range of control variables (====, size of property, shopping chain fixed effects) and an instrumental variable approach.====To be more specific, as emphasised in the agglomeration literature, both our measures of shopping externalities, ==== footfall and number of shops in the vicinity, are essentially measures of spatial concentration that may be endogenous because they tend to be positively correlated to unobserved attractive location characteristics. We address this issue by focusing on shops that are located within the same shopping street and are therefore close to each other.==== This strategy largely addresses the issue that footfall and number of shops in the vicinity are generated by local amenities and accessibility. We further control for a wide range of shop and street characteristics, as well as local amenities that may generate footfall that is not related to shopping, such as the number of schools, public buildings and religious buildings. Furthermore, using web-scraped data from ====, we control for the number of pictures taken by tourists and residents in the shopping street, which proxy for difficult-to-capture differences in amenities and attractiveness within a street (Gaigné et al., 2018).====Nevertheless, it is plausible that endogeneity issues are still present for both measures of shopping externalities due to measurement error and reverse causation issues, which would yield an ==== of shopping externalities. We believe there are three reasons which may cause reverse causation. First, attractive, and therefore expensive, streets disproportionally attract shops with high-end brands (==== Louis Vitton, Giorgio Armani). These shops generate little footfall, so that there is a downward bias of the estimated footfall coefficient. In the Dutch context, the main example is the P.C. Hooftstraat in Amsterdam, but one observes the same phenomenon in well-known shopping streets in other countries (New Bond Street, London; Champs-Élysées, Paris; Via Monte Napoleone, Milan; Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich). Second, a retail firm that signs a contract to pay high fixed rents may be more likely to ‘work hard’ to generate footfall (and, therefore, sales) in order to ensure that it can afford these rents. Third, one may argue that there is a simultaneity problem (which usually does not occur in a hedonic price setting), because we consider the aggregate number of shops (and footfall) in a location, which would fall with rents, as in a standard textbook supply-demand setting with a homogeneous good.====Endogeneity issues also play a role when focusing on the effects on vacancies. For example, a higher level of vacancies in a street will likely induce less foot traffic and, mechanically, reduce the small number of non-vacant stores in the vicinity.====To address these endogeneity issues, we will employ an instrumental variables approach using the exact location of cinemas in 1930. Because there is a high autocorrelation of retail locations, it appears that the number of cinemas in 1930 has a strong effect on footfall and on number of shops in the vicinity. This is not too surprising: for example, the maim shopping street in Amsterdam nowadays, de Kalverstraat, has been one of the main shopping streets for almost 300 years. Note that we identify these effects ==== shopping streets and control for the ==== location of cinemas, hence our instrument plausibly addresses the various endogeneity concerns.====We also make sure that our results do not depend on this particular choice of instruments by going back even further in time. We will use the number of shops in 1832 as an instrument. This instrument is particularly convincing because we show, using data on land values in 1832, that past attractive locations do not command higher retail rents nowadays. We are able to show that the location of shops in 1832 is a strong instrument (for footfall and number of shops), even when we control for the number of buildings in 1832. We discuss the assumptions underlying our identification strategy at length in the paper.====Our results show that footfall and number of shops have a strong positive effect on rental income with an elasticity ranging from 0.25–0.50. When instrumenting, the estimates for both footfall and number of shops are somewhat higher. Thus, there are substantial external benefits from fostering footfall and retail concentration.====Based on these estimates, the optimal level of subsidy to store owners appears to be substantial, which potentially justifies a range of current policies that are especially beneficial to shopping streets. Current policies either subsidise shop owners, ==== through pedestrianisation of popular shopping streets, or subsidise shoppers either through the provision of (subsidised, and sometimes even free) public transport to shopping districts or parking. Zoning policies which concentrates shopping into shopping streets (==== at the expense of residential housing), may also be beneficial.==== Our paper links and contributes to three strands of literature. First, it relates to the literature on spatial competition and product differentiation (D’Aspremont, Gabszewicz, Thisse, 1979, Osborne, Pitchik, 1987). Davis (2006) focuses on movie theatres, and evaluates consumers’ transport costs, the effect of geographic differentiation, and the extent of market power. Seim (2006) shows that there are significant returns to product (or spatial) differentiation and illustrates that markets with more scope for differentiation support greater entry. Jia (2008) and Arcidiacono et al. (2016) study the impact of Wal-Mart on the retail market on incumbent (discount) supermarkets and small grocery stores. Clapp et al. (2016) focus on openings and closings of multi-line department stores and find evidence for strong negative competitive effects within the own branch. Zhou (2014) shows that multi-product search, which is important when consumers buy multiple products in one shopping trip, can significantly influence retail firms’ pricing decisions. Johansen and Nilssen (2016) investigate the conditions under which one-stop shopping causes the formation of big stores. However, these papers ignore that many shops benefit from each other when located close to each other.====Our paper also relates to a second literature that explicitly focuses on the benefits of agglomeration for firms. There is ample evidence that firms that locate close together benefit through input- and output sharing, labour market pooling and knowledge spillovers (Marshall, 1890). Current evidence suggests that the elasticity of productivity with respect to density is around 0.05 (see ==== the meta-analysis by Melo et al., 2009). This literature typically focuses on the manufacturing industry. Compared to that literature, we find substantial agglomeration elasticities, which are (at least) 5 times larger. This is in line with Koster et al. (2014), who show that agglomeration economies are much more important for retail firms. Teulings et al. (2017) use a monocentric model where customers arrive in a central location and have to walk to shops around this location. Locations that are further away from the centre are therefore expected to be less profitable. Their empirical evidence indicates that rents in shopping districts are indeed higher close to the centre.====Our findings also contribute to a more policy-oriented literature studying the effectiveness of retail policies, in particular towards the effects of the opening of large ‘big-box’ retailers near the urban fringe (Sanchez-Vidal, 2016). Some studies demonstrate that the welfare effects of current planning policies that hinder entry in retail markets, and particularly of large retailers, are negative. Several studies have shown that regulation policies reduce retail productivity and job growth and increase market power of incumbent stores (Bertrand, Kramarz, 2002, Schivardi, Viviano, 2011, Haskel, Sadun, 2012, Cheshire, Hilber, Kaplanis, 2015). By contrast, our study shows that current policies that implicitly subsidise store owners in shopping streets are potentially welfare improving, as they make it more attractive to open additional stores in dense areas. This conclusion is consistent with the shopping mall literature, which shows that the provision of substantial rent discounts to ‘anchor’ stores in US shopping malls to internalise externalities is common practice (Pashigian, Gould, 1998, Gould, Pashigian, Prendergast, 2005). Shopping externalities may justify public policies that pedestrianise shopping streets in order to effectively cluster shops and internalise external benefits.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the theoretical framework that guides the empirical results. Section 3 introduces the data and reports descriptive statistics, followed by a discussion of the econometric framework in Section 4. In Section 5, we present and discuss our results, including the estimates of the optimal subsidy. Section 6 discusses an extension where we allow for a heterogeneous version of our model. Also the main sensitivity analyses are discussed. The latter are described in more detail in Appendix D.

First, it estimates the value of public school quality in the same unit in which public schools’ costs are measured and private school tuition is charged: per year, per child at each grade level. Second, it develops a novel approach to control for unobservables correlated to school quality, including those generated by sorting. People without school-age children enjoy neighborhood-level amenities but do not enjoy school-level amenities, so data about their residential choice can be used to control for neighborhood unobservables, isolating the value of school quality per se. I embed this idea into a dynamic model of neighborhood choice, building on previously unconnected literatures. Using the 2000 U.S. Census data, I find that parents tend to value school quality more in elementary and high school grades relative to middle school grades. However, improving public school quality currently costs more than is worth to parents even at the most valued grades, so externalities in education are necessary to justify such investments. These findings highlight the importance of improving the efficiency with which school resources are spent.","In recent years, there has been a growing interest in evaluating the efficiency with which public money is spent within the educational system. Information on the costs of running different public schools are readily available and so are the schools’ quality measurements. However, any cost-benefit evaluation needs to incorporate a third, crucial ingredient: the parental value of public school quality. This paper estimates how much parents are willing to pay for public school quality per year, per child at each grade level. This unit of measurement is important for a comparison with the costs of improving public school quality and with the tuition charged by competing private schools.====Using the 2000 U.S. Census data for Minnesota, I find that parents are, on average, willing to pay $2,400, $1,400 and $2,700 yearly per child for an investment that improves test scores by one standard deviation in elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively. Such investments, however, cost at least $2,850 per pupil per year.==== These findings highlight the importance of improving the efficiency with which public school resources are spent; otherwise externalities in education are necessary to justify such investments.====Because there is no direct market to purchase public schooling, researchers have attempted to estimate the valuation of public school quality by comparing the prices of similar houses in neighborhoods that are also similar except for their level of school quality (Black and Machin, 2011 provides a recent survey of this prolific literature). An important concern in this literature is to fully control for the demographic composition of neighbors, since otherwise they will bias the valuation estimates. Unobservable demographics of neighbors are post-determined, as households sort because of differences in school quality. Thus, any bias due to omitted demographics of neighbors cannot be fully avoided with the use of instrumental variables; instead, these need to be explicitly controlled for.==== The conventional way of handling this issue is to explicitly add observed demographics as controls, but this may not be enough to absorb unobservables. Moreover, it might also partially absorb the demographics of school peers, thus identifying only the value for the component of school quality that is orthogonal to school peers. Of course, such measure of the value of school quality is important for many policies aimed at changing school inputs, particularly in the short-run, but it is difficult to use it to infer the value parents give to an open enrollment policy, to a private school voucher system, or to other programs that enable them to opt among schools with different peers.====This paper complements this literature in two ways. First, it develops a new way of controlling for omitted variables. It controls for unobservables, including the demographics of neighbors, and it does so without controlling for the demographics of school peers. This strategy can be implemented on its own or together with other approaches to control for unobservables such as the use of boundary fixed effects (Black, 1999), which has been successful at controlling for much of the endogeneity in this context. Second, it provides estimates at a specific unit of measurement that facilitates cost-benefit analyses: per year, per child at each grade level. Because families may intend to stay in the same house for longer than one year, and because children of the same family may attend public schools in different grades, the estimate obtained directly from housing choices spans more than one year, one child and one grade.====The proposed approach has three steps. The first step estimates a dynamic model of residential sorting. Because of moving costs, families are aware that their residential choice today will influence their future residential decisions. Thus, this step extracts the family’s per-year valuation of the neighborhood from the family’s total valuation of the neighborhood (which also includes the continuation value of that neighborhood from next year onwards). The second step extracts the family’s per-year valuation of public school quality from the family’s per-year valuation of the neighborhood (which also includes the per-year valuation of other amenities). Here, neighborhood unobserved amenities are proxied by neighborhood ==== valuations of families without school-age children (including non-parents). These proxies control for the characteristics of neighbors and other confounders without controlling for the characteristics of school peers, since in that year these families do not enjoy the school amenities. The third step distributes the families’ per-year valuations of public school quality among their children according to the grade each child attends, aggregating the information across all families to obtain an estimate of the parental value of public school quality per year, per child at each grade level. Fig. 1 illustrates these three steps for a family with two children, one attending grade 3 and the other attending grade 6.====To obtain estimates at the desired unit of measurement, the first step requires an estimation of a dynamic model with Decennial Census data - a cross-sectional dataset. To accommodate this data restriction, I make a synthetic cohort assumption to connect the contemporaneous residential choices of different families observed at different times in their life cycle, as if these choices were from the same family along its own life cycle.==== For example, I assume that families with an 8-year-old child expect to have the same preferences next year as families with a 9-year-old child have this year. I provide evidence suggesting that this assumption is reasonable in the context of this paper. Moreover, I argue that in practice small violations of this assumption should not bias the estimate of the value of school quality, which is the main parameter of interest. Intuitively, violations of this assumption might bias the intermediate estimator of the per-year value of the neighborhood, but this bias should be absorbed by controls in the next step of the estimation procedure.====Methodologically, this paper relates to two separate literatures. The first literature estimates the valuation of non-marketed goods with horizontal neighborhood sorting models using a discrete choice framework. Three papers are particularly relevant to this study. Bayer et al. (2007) embeds the boundary fixed effects approach into a static discrete choice framework, building on insights from the Industrial Organization (Berry, 1994), (Berry et al., 1995), and estimate the valuations of public school quality and neighbors’ demographic composition. More recently, Bayer et al. (2016) uses longitudinal data on homeowners to estimate the valuation of violent crime, air pollution and racial composition with a dynamic discrete choice model, building on insights from Rust (1987) and Hotz and Miller (1993). Finally, Mastromonaco (2014) builds on Bajari et al. (2012) and Bayer et al. (2016) to estimate the general equilibrium impact of school quality on wealth accumulation, prices and the demographic composition of neighborhoods.==== Besides the differences in methodology and underlying assumptions, Mastromonaco (2014) aims at explicitly studying the sorting due to school quality, while this paper aims at controlling for it. As in Bayer et al. (2007), this paper estimates the valuation of public school quality with a discrete choice framework, but with two key differences. First, it uses a different approach to treat the endogeneity problem. Second, it estimates a dynamic rather than a static model. The dynamic estimation approach I develop departs from standard approaches in a similar way as Bayer et al. (2016), but imposes assumptions to accommodate estimation with the Decennial Census data.====The second literature involves the use of a specific panel data method to control for unobservables. This technique, discussed in Chamberlain (1977) and Pudney (1982), has been applied to wage regressions by Heckman and Scheinkman (1987), but so far has not been applied to choice models. The main methodological contribution of the paper lies in embedding this method in a discrete choice framework, thus connecting these two literatures. The approach that arises from this connection is potentially useful for a wide range of applications in demand estimation, because it provides a new way of controlling for unobservables, including those inherently endogenous such as the neighbors’ demographic compositions. The key idea is to construct control variables from observed ==== of others, not from observed ====. This is helpful because choices should reflect all characteristics, including the ones unobserved to econometricians.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the identification strategy in its simplest form, avoiding many of the details necessary for the implementation in the specific context of the paper. Remark 1 in that section explains why this approach cannot be implemented in the context of an hedonic framework. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 describes the implemented identification strategy of the paper in three steps. The approach developed in step 1 (Section 4.1) relates to the estimation of a dynamic model of demand, and the approach developed in step 2 (Section 4.2) represents the generalized version of the method described in Section 2. Either of these two methods might be useful in other applications by themselves, so they are presented in a self-contained way; however, reading Section 2 beforehand will help the understanding of Section 4.2. Section 5 presents the empirical results and robustness checks. Section 6 provides a more detailed discussion of the results, and, finally, Section 7 offers some concluding remarks. Appendix A presents some technical details, and Appendix B provides a Monte Carlo study of the approach to control for unobservables developed in the paper (Section 4.2).",Neighborhood sorting and the value of public school quality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300701,26 September 2019,2019,Research Article,133.0

We show that there exists a unique organizational equilibrium, which typically involves the coexistence of various organizational forms. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for the three types of firms to coexist within the same region and show that transportation and communication costs have opposite effects on firms’ organizational choices. This suggests that, depending on its nature, the supply of a new transportation infrastructure may lead to contrasted locational patterns.","The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the geography of production by showing how the interplay between communication and transportation/trade costs affects the way firms organize their activities across space. Building an economic geography setting in which both costs are taken into account, we investigate why identical firms operating in the same technological and market environment choose different spatial organizational forms and how these choices affect regional prices, outputs, and welfare. While most research in economic geography is based on external drivers, our approach stresses the role of communication costs as an internal driver.====Even since the Industrial Revolution, transportation costs have plummeted. However, firms operate multiple plants to supply spatially separated markets, thus suggesting that distance remains a major impediment to trade in several sectors (Hillberry and Hummels, 2008). What is more, firms are packages of different functions, such as management, R&D, finance, marketing, and production. Due to the development of new information and communication technologies (ICT), firms are able to disperse these functions into geographically separated units in order to benefit from the attributes specific to different locations (Aarland et al., 2007).====Yet, Fink et al. (2005) find that communication costs have a significant impact on trade patterns, especially for differentiated goods. For multi-plant US firms Giroud (2013) shows that the opening of new airline links that reduce the travel time between headquarters and plants generated an increase of 7% in plant productivity. Charnoz et al. (2018) use the development of the high-speed railway network in France to show how the decrease in passenger travel time between headquarters and affiliates allowed a higher concentration of management functions in the headquarters. In the same vein, Kalnins and Lafontaine (2013) observe that a greater distance to the headquarters is associated with shorter establishment longevity. Why is this so? The transmission of knowledge via the new ICT remains incomplete and imperfect (Leamer and Storper, 2001). In addition, face-to-face contacts are still needed between specialized workers operating in spatially separated plants and headquarters because such contacts allow for immediate feedback in non-routine activities (Battiston et al., 2017). The list could go on much further. Thus, despite the ICT revolution, we may safely conclude that the communication curse is still with us.====A firm conducting all its activities under the same roof has what we call a spatially ==== structure (====-firm). When firms are not spatially integrated, we distinguish between the following two types of spatial organization. The firm adopts a ==== structure when several plants produce the same good at different locations (====-firm). The cost of being horizontal is the loss in scale economies, while the benefit is direct access to each market with zero transportation costs. By contrast, the firm selects a ==== structure when it organizes and performs discrete activities at distinct locations, which altogether form a supply chain (====-firm). The vertical fragmentation of the firm aims to take advantage of differences in market size, but this involves communication costs between the headquarters and plants, as well as transportation costs from the distant region to the domestic one.====The coexistence of the three types of firms is observed in many real world situations. For instance, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry provides a unique dataset, Kogyo Statistics, that describes the spatial organization of manufacturing firms. Integrated firms account for about 71% of the manufacturing sector and vertical firms with only one plant for about 12%; the remaining 17% are operated by multi-plant firms, which are horizontal (Okubo and Tomiura, 2016). The dataset accounts for firms with more than four full-time employees, which probably explains the high share of integrated firms. In Denmark, the average distance between plants and their headquarters has more than double during the last three decades, thus showing the growing importance of vertical firms, while the share of multi-plant firms has increased (Acosta and Lyngemark, 2019). There is also a vast literature in urban economics that documents the fact that city centers attract management or administrative activities, while operation plants are located in edge cities, hinterland cities of the same country or abroad, where land and/or labor are cheap (Henderson, 1997, Henderson, Ono, 2008, Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, Owens III, 2009).====As pointed out by Helpman (2006), the diversity of firms’ spatial organizations goes beyond these canonical forms. However, we limit ourselves to the above three forms because considering several types of organizational forms involves a large number of cases to investigate. For example, focusing only on the three canonical types of organization in a two-region setting yields the discouraging number of 49 candidates patterns. This should not come as a surprise since, when studying the geographical separation of front-offices and back-offices in the standard monocentric city model, Ota and Fujita (1993) find that 11 configurations may emerge as an equilibrium according to the values of the main parameters of their model.====Despite a rich literature on multinational enterprises, economic geography has neglected to address the simultaneous occurrence of integrated, vertical, and horizontal firms. This is where we hope to contribute by developing a standard setting in which firms have a headquarters whose location is given and one or two plants whose locations are endogenous. More specifically, we assume that firms are free to choose the number and locations of their plants in the presence of transportation, communication, and fixed production costs. We then use this setting to study how the interregional distribution of activities varies with transportation and communication costs and how various regional magnitudes are affected. Furthermore, since our aim is to study the impact of communication and transportation costs on firms’ organizational choices, we control for the main factors that explain differences in firms’ organizational forms in the literature on multinational enterprises, i.e., wage inequality and technological differences across space (Antràs and Yeaple, 2014). More specifically, we isolate market size as the only ex ante difference between the two regions, a variable whose empirical relevance is well known (Head, Mayer, 2004, Redding, 2011).====In a closed economy, when identical monopolistically competitive firms have the option of investing in new technologies to produce at a lower marginal cost, they face a trade-off between the cost of adopting the new technology and market size. Importantly, they all make the same choice and remain ex post identical (Elberfeld, 2003). In an open economy, whether firms choose to be integrated or horizontal depends on fixed production costs and the relative size of markets, but the level of transportation costs also matters. Taking communication costs on board allows firms to choose to be vertical or not. These costs interact in a non-trivial way with market size to determine the share of firms that choose a specific organizational form.====Our main findings are as follows. For any given values of transportation, communication, fixed production costs, and the relative market sizes, we first show that ====. However, that the equilibrium is unique does not mean that firms are organized according to the same configuration. Instead, the equilibrium configuration chosen by firms typically changes with the parameter values. Apart from the extreme cases where all firms are horizontal (integrated) because fixed costs are very low (high) relative to market size, ====. Indeed, (i) not all firms located in the smaller region choose to be integrated because their domestic market is too competitive; (ii) not all firms choose to be vertical because this renders the big market very competitive; and (iii) not all firms choose to be horizontal because both markets become very competitive.====In this paper, we have chosen to focus primarily on the case where the three organizational forms come together which we call a mixed equilibrium. For this to happen, market sizes must differ, but not by too much. Furthermore, we show that only the smaller region hosts the three types of organizational forms; the larger region’s firms remain integrated. In other words, there is one-way offshoring. Some of the smaller region’s firms invest in the other region to have a better access to the larger market. At the same time, other firms remain integrated and focus on the smaller market because the establishment of distant plants makes competition in the larger market tougher while the displacement of plants toward the larger region makes competition in the smaller region softer. However, it worth noting that the same holds for most of the other equilibria where the smaller region hosts two or one type of firm. In sum, the larger region’s firms are integrated while it pays for the smaller region’s firms to be different.====The foregoing results imply that the home market effect holds true when the mass of plants is endogenous: ====. This result is reassuring because it shows that our setting is consistent with the economic geography literature (Baldwin et al., 2003). However, we want to stress the following difference: here the mass of plants is endogenous whereas the home market effect is usually obtained when the mass of (integrated) firms is exogenously given. Therefore, that the home market effect still holds when the mass of plants is endogenous is not a straightforward implication of existing results.====The coexistence of the three organizational forms is socially optimal under conditions similar to those that sustain the market equilibrium. In other words, the coexistence of various organizational forms is not evidence of a market failure. Nevertheless, since a firm’s production cost depends on its organizational choice, the cost distribution is now endogenous, which implies that the numbers of firms adopting a specific structure in the equilibrium and optimal outcomes need not be the same. To be precise, we show that too few firms are horizontal while too many firms are vertical. All in all, too few firms invest in the larger region in order to soften competition therein.====Having done this, we study how transportation and communication costs affect the pattern of organizational types at the mixed equilibrium. First, when shipping goods becomes cheaper, the number of plants operating in each region decreases because firms change their organizational form in response to a drop in transportation costs. Our analysis confirms the classical result in the theory of multinational enterprises, that is, ==== (Markusen, 2002). More specifically, lowering transportation costs leads to a hike in the number of integrated firms. However, although the number of horizontal firms is reduced, the number of vertical firms rises.====Second, in accordance with Krugman (1995) and others who argued that low communication costs allow the slicing up of the supply chain, we find that ====. Even though the total number of plants increases, the smaller region hosts fewer plants. Simply put, lower transportation costs or communication costs have opposite impacts on the spatial patterns of production: in the former more firms are integrated, while in the latter more firms are fragmented==== In other words, more efficient transportation fosters the interregional dispersion of production, whereas more efficient communication technologies promote the spatial concentration of production in the larger region. Our results concur with Baldwin (2016) who argued that drops in transportation and communication costs are at the origin of two different phases of globalization.====Third, profits are higher when transportation costs decrease. This runs against the widespread idea that spatial separation endows firms with market power (Ottaviano and Thisse, 2004). Thus, our analysis shows that, in response to lower transportation costs, ====. Everything being equal, consumers are, therefore, worse-off because regional markets are less competitive. Even when profits are redistributed to consumers, the impact of a deeper market integration is ambiguous as it varies with the level of transportation, communication, and fixed production costs. On the other hand, lower transportation costs foster a higher GDP in each region, but exacerbate regional disparities, whereas lower communication costs reduce GDP in each region, but promotes regional convergence.====This difference in results has an interesting implication from the policy viewpoint. Indeed, improving accessibility through the provision of new transportation infrastructure is one of the main policy instruments used by governments and international agencies to foster regional development (Redding and Turner, 2015). Policy instruments typically involve the building of highways, high-speed railways, or airports. Our analysis shows that these instruments may have different impacts on the space-economy. Indeed, new highways makes shipping of commodities cheaper. By contrast, new high-speed railways or airports reduce the travel costs of business people and professionals, thus reducing communication costs by making face-to-face contacts easier. As a result, ====. When the aim of transport policy is to affect the spatial distribution of activities, there is a need to distinguish between different types of infrastructure, an issue that has been overlooked in the literature.====Last, when firms are exogenously heterogeneous in productivity, it is not clear that firms may want to be differentiated in spatial organizational forms because they are already differentiated in costs. Therefore, we find it natural to investigate what our main findings become when firms are heterogeneous à la Melitz. As in the foregoing, we show that the smaller region hosts the three types of firms under conditions that are similar to those obtained when firms are homogeneous. The most efficient firms always choose to become horizontal because these firms are able to bear the higher fixed costs associated with the operation of two plants. On the other hand, the organizational form selected by the medium efficient firms depends on the relative size of the two markets. When the asymmetry is strong, the medium efficient firms go vertical because their domestic market is too small. Otherwise, they go integrated because their domestic market offers a sufficiently big outlet.====Admittedly, our results are obtained using a bare-bone framework. Accounting for a richer set of effects might turn down some of our conclusions. Nevertheless, by recognizing that firms may choose their organizational form, our paper shows that ==== in that they might deliver misleading policy recommendations.==== Our model is closely linked to one of the workhorses of economic geography, that is, the footloose capital model where firms run a single plant and are spatially integrated (Baldwin et al., 2003). By contrast, we allow firms to choose their organizational forms, that is, the headquarters and plants may or may not collocate, while firms may operate one or several plants. Therefore, our setting can be viewed as the “footloose plant model”. Behrens and Picard (2007) used an economic geography setting to compare integrated and horizontal firms. These authors find that, as transportation costs decrease, multiplant firms close their plants in the small region and serve this market through trade from the large region. Fujita and Thisse (2006) highlighted the role of communication costs in firms’ decisions to go vertical in a setting where all firms are established in the core region. They showed that firms located in the core region are integrated, integrated and vertical, and vertical only when communication costs steadily decrease. Fujita and Gokan (2005) extended this setting to the case where firms may be integrated, horizontal or vertical. Depending on the levels of transportation and communication costs, the equilibrium outcome involves any one firm type or any two firm types. Robert-Nicoud (2008) used a similar model to show that the spatial fragmentation of the supply chain may be beneficial to consumers when communication costs are low.====We differ from these three contributions in at least two major respects. First, in our setting, firms are located in both regions, so that the intensity of competition varies with the organizational choices made by firms located in each region. Second, we investigate a set of issues that these authors do not consider. Yeaple (2003) is closer to us in that he studies the simultaneous emergence of the three organizational forms. To do this, Yeaple considered a 3-country setting and shows that the same firm may choose to go horizontal in one country and vertical in the other.====The paper is organized as follows. The model is described in Section 2. Section 3 deals with the equilibrium and welfare analyses when firms have the same productivity. The impact of market size is discussed in Section 4, while the various effects triggered by lower transportation and communication costs are studied in Section 5. Section 6 discusses what our main findings become when firms differ in productivity. Section 7 concludes.",How do trade and communication costs shape the spatial organization of firms?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300683,13 September 2019,2019,Research Article,134.0

Hiring slowed to extremely low levels, employers took longer to fill vacancies (Davis et al., 2012), and unemployment peaked at 10%.==== In other words, the labor market was dysfunctional along most commonly measured metrics, so that displaced workers at that time faced large barriers to re-employment. In this paper, we examine whether labor market networks, which help to resolve information imperfections between job searchers and firms, assist in the re-employment of recently-displaced job searchers. We study the productivity of networks formed by residential neighbors. More specifically, we examine whether the productivity of these networks declined during the Great Recession, further exacerbating the already large challenges displaced workers faced in finding re-employment then.====Our particular focus on the job finding outcomes of displaced workers is natural given the outsized importance of the large number of displaced workers during the Great Recession, and also given the compelling existing evidence that job displacement is an extreme adverse event. Displaced workers on average suffer years of low (or no) earnings post-displacement (e.g. Jacobsen et al., 1993, hereafter JLS; Davis and von Wachter, 2011), and even experience higher mortality (Sullivan and von Wachter, 2009).====Our emphasis on labor market networks defined by residential neighborhoods arises because of prior research indicating that such networks play an important role in matching workers to employers (Bayer et al., 2008, Hellerstein et al., 2011 (HMN) and 2014 (HKN), Schmutte (2015)), especially for lower-skilled workers who arguably were hit hardest by job displacement during the Great Recession (e.g., Farber, 2015). Because networks can only be productive when hiring is occurring, we focus on a measure of the strength of labor market networks that incorporates not only the number of employed neighbors of a laid off worker, but also the gross hiring rate at that person's neighbors’ workplaces – which we therefore view as characterizing how “active” the network is.====There are multiple reasons to think that the productivity of networks may have fallen during the Great Recession.==== The theoretical model in Galenianos (2014) predicts that network productivity should have been lower during the Great Recession for two reasons: because higher unemployment rates among network members lead an unemployed worker to be less likely to find work via a network contact (as explicitly modeled in the paper); and because an economic contraction means that fewer employers will seek to expand employment by hiring referred workers (as implicitly suggested via the model parameters). Empirically, Davis et al. (2012) show that employers filled vacancies at a slower rate during and after the Great Recession, potentially because the transactions costs of hiring and firing weighed more heavily on hiring decisions in the face of unusually high uncertainty about product demand. This might also suggest that referrals were less productive in filling vacancies. Anecdotally, there were conflicting stories about whether network connections were more productive or less productive during and after the Great Recession.==== For example, some stories claimed that network hiring became more important in the Great Recession as employers grew pickier about their hires, while others suggested that networks were less important during the recession because network connections were “severed” by the huge labor market upheavals.====In the end, understanding the changing effects of networks during the Great Recession can only come via careful empirical analyses. To address this question, we quantify the effects of network strength on the employment recovery of displaced workers in the periods before, during, and right after the Great Recession, testing whether strong labor market networks formed by residential neighbors helped in the labor market recovery of displaced workers by facilitating re-employment overall, and re-employment specifically with hiring employers where neighbors in the network were already working. Following many previous studies on displaced workers, we focus on displaced workers who were displaced in mass layoffs. And although the data we use are by nature observational (as are virtually all studies of displaced workers), we harness the power of our detailed administrative data (the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, or LEHD) to estimate heavily saturated regression models in order to account for differential selection into displacement and into different kinds of residential networks and labor markets, to make a causal interpretation of our evidence more credible.====To summarize, we find that stronger residence-based labor market networks facilitate re-employment by matching displaced workers to vacancies, especially at neighbor's employers – as theory would suggest. These effects are driven by low earners, as might be expected given that the relevant labor markets for low-skilled workers tend to be more local. Importantly, while both employment and especially hiring dropped markedly during the Great Recession, severely damaging the re-employment prospects of displaced workers, we find no evidence of a decline in the ==== of residence-based labor market networks matching job searchers to their neighbors’ employers. This suggests that labor market networks may still be an important tool for job searchers to activate, even during economic downturns.",Labor market networks and recovery from mass layoffs: Evidence from the Great Recession period,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300695,12 September 2019,2019,Research Article,135.0

We also show suggestive evidence to indicate that the social norm to work serves as an underlying mechanism of the observed ==== despite data limitations.","Does a high employment rate among neighbors increase an individual's employment probability? Previous studies show that neighborhood quality is strongly correlated with an individual's labor market outcomes (Borjas, 1995; Cutler and Glaeser, 1997; Weinberg et al., 2004). However, well-known problems, such as self-sorting into neighborhoods, common shocks, and the reflection problem (Manski, 1993, 2000), make it difficult to identify the causal effect of neighbors’ employment rate. A few recent studies attempt to solve these problems using an instrumental variable for neighbors’ employment status (Maurin and Moschion, 2009) or controls for various fixed effects to absorb the self-sorting of neighbors (Bayer et al., 2008). However, experimental evidence from randomly assigned neighbors is still scarce in the context of peer effects in employment, unlike peer effects in student outcomes or workplace productivity.====In this study, we exploit the random assignment of temporary housing to evacuees of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident to identify the effect of neighbors’ employment rate on the probability of finding a job after evacuation. After the accident caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami, people living within a 30-km radius of the plant were forced to evacuate to other municipalities. Several months later, many of these evacuees were moved from emergency shelters to publicly provided temporary housing units allocated through a government lottery. This situation provided a rare opportunity to examine the causal effect of the peer employment rate using randomly assigned neighbors.====We use unique survey data collected from 14 temporary housing clusters in Iwaki city, the largest and most populated city in Fukushima prefecture, 2.5 years after the accident. Among the 587 sampled individuals aged 20–69 years, 479 were not employed as of the end of March 2011, the month when the power plant accident occurred. We estimate the effect of the employment status of peers neighbors on duration to resuming work among evacuees. We find a significantly positive effect that is robust to various controls for individual characteristics and housing cluster fixed effects. The effect is not only statistically significant, but also economically substantial: the impact of an increase of one percentage point in the initial employment rate of an individual's neighbors roughly corresponds to a 0.2 percentage-point increase in the probability of employment after six months.====This study is built on the growing literature on neighborhood effects for people who are exogenously assigned to a new neighborhood. There are two strands of existing studies: social experiments that relocate randomly selected residents in poor neighborhoods to neighborhoods with lower poverty rates (e.g., the Moving-to-Opportunity [MTO] Program) and studies that examine refugee immigrants whose residential location in the host county is exogenously assigned. A comparison of these two strands suggests that the significance of neighborhood effects may depend on the degree to which the randomly assigned residents can maintain their sense of community with their peers. On the one hand, studies of MTO-type social experiments consider all residents in the neighborhood as the peer group. However, social interactions between program participants and peers may be infrequent given their different socioeconomic backgrounds. Previous studies consistently point out that adult participants feel isolated from new neighbors (Barnhardt et al., 2015); such studies typically find no improvement in outcomes for adults (Kling et al., 2007; Barnhardt et al., 2015). On the other hand, the peer group in refugee studies includes only immigrants in the neighborhood, who share similar backgrounds. The sense of community may be strong with such peers and social interactions may be frequent. Previous studies indeed demonstrate significant influences from peers. Damm (2014) finds that labor market outcomes for refugee immigrants to Denmark were affected by the average skill level of non-Western immigrants living in the neighborhood rather than the overall population of the neighborhood. Studies of ethnic enclaves of refugee immigrants (Edin et al., 2003; Damm, 2009) also suggest that neighbors who share the same ethnic background affect immigrants’ labor market performance. Our findings of significant effects among evacuees lend support to this role of the sense of community, since all the residents of a temporary housing cluster are from the same municipality and aware that the community in the cluster is enduring.====However, this study has three distinctive features compared with previous studies on refugee immigrants. The first critical difference is that previous studies examine how local neighbors affect new migrants, whereas we focus on how new migrants affect each other. It is frequently observed that new communities are formed exclusively by new migrants (e.g., refugee camps, temporary housing for victims of natural disasters, and school dormitories). Nevertheless, empirical evidence of peer effects in employment among such new migrants is scarce compared with studies of the influence of local neighbors on new migrants. The second key difference is access to the formal job market. On the one hand, since refugee immigrants have a different cultural background and speak a different language from people in the host country, they may have poor access to formal job search. On the other hand, forced evacuees should have the same access as locals to the formal job market since they have been relocated within the same prefecture and speak the same language.==== The third feature is financial assistance provided to the evacuees. The evacuees benefited from extended unemployment insurance for 210 days and compensation from the electric company, which may have resulted in lowered financial incentives to work and allowed them to delay their job search.====All these features could affect the underlying mechanisms behind the observed effect of neighbors’ employment rate on an individual's employment probability. We consider three potential channels driving the observed peer effect====: joint consumption, the social norm to work, and residence-based job information networks including both direct referrals and other information sharing. In the context of the effect of local neighbors on new migrants, the social norm to work may not be important, because the neighbors know that their unfamiliarity with the local labor market makes it difficult for new migrants to find jobs. Instead, existing studies have shown that residence-based job information networks play an important role in neighborhood effects from local residents to new migrants (Edin et al., 2003; Damm, 2009, 2014) and among local residents (Topa and Zenou, 2015).====By contrast, all evacuees in our setting are on equal ground, that is, they were forced to move to Iwaki in March 2011. Thus, unemployed evacuees may feel pressure from peers who have already found jobs. Lack of financial incentive also increases the intrinsic motivation for normative behavior such as work (Benabou and Tirole, 2000; Bowles and Polania-Reyes, 2012; Festré, 2010; Rebitzer and Taylor, 2011). Thus, pressure from peers may be higher among those with less financial incentive to work. Conversely, the existence of substantial non-labor income may weaken the peer effect through the motive to join leisure activities with neighbors with decent jobs, especially if the amount of the assistance is large enough even for unemployed evacuees to afford to participate.====Consistent with these predictions, we show suggestive evidence against joint consumption and weakly supporting the social norm channel. Since our data lacks information regarding the jobs held at the time of survey, we cannot test whether residence-based job information networks also contributed to the observed peer effect. Nonetheless, there is no reason to rule out them, as they do not contradict with the social norm to work. The inconclusiveness about the underlying mechanism is a major limitation of this study.====Despite this limitation, the resettlement of displaced people is an important policy issue. In particular disasters increase the unemployment rate (Groen and Polivka, 2008) and this is a critical concern of policymakers (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2006). However, few empirical studies suggest how employment can be restored. Our findings suggest that the employment rates of these individuals depend on the makeup of the groups in which they are resettled.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the detailed process of housing lotteries and explains how we define a peer group. Section 3 describes the data and summary statistics. The empirical strategy to estimate peer effects is presented in Section 4, and the results in Section 5.

A major source of this unreliability is that when roads are congested, interactions between drivers can lead to capacity unexpectedly falling. For example, collisions can close lanes and aggressive lane changers can slow traffic. This paper analyzes how tolls should be set when accounting for such endogenous reliability. We find tolls should be higher and maximum flow lower than we might naïvely expect; and that such tolls make homogeneous drivers better off, even before the toll revenue is used. Simulations suggest the socially optimal maximum departure rate is 15% below that which maximizes expected throughput, and that tolling reduces private costs by almost 10%.","Traffic congestion is a serious problem for cities worldwide. In the United States, 41% of mayors report that traffic congestion is one of their top three problems (Bloomberg Philanthropies, 2018). More than half of the time lost to traffic congestion is due to non-recurring congestion; that is, congestion caused by crashes, bad weather, and other shocks (Dowling, Skabardonis, Carroll, Wang, et al., 2004, Kwon, Mauch, Varaiya, et al., 2006). Non-recurring congestion leads to unpredictable travel times. Due to this unpredictability, drivers have to depart earlier than they would prefer. On good days they arrive with time to spare and on bad days they suffer the consequences of arriving late for work or an important appointment. This lack of reliability accounts for between 30 and 70% of the total cost of congestion (Small, Winston, Yan, et al., 2005, Bento, Roth, Waxman, 2017).====While some of the shocks which cause non-recurring congestion are exogenous, such as bad weather, others shocks are endogenous. For endogenous shocks, their probability of occurring increases with traffic flow (the number of vehicles passing a given point per lane per hour). For example, the rate at which crashes occur per vehicle-mile traveled more than doubles as the flow increases from 1500 to 2000 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) (Kononov et al., 2012).==== Furthermore, as traffic flow increases the probability that a small shock leads to a collapse in outflow also increases. Transportation engineers call this collapse “flow breakdown” or a “capacity drop”. Numerous types of small shocks can cause flow breakdown, including vehicles weaving between lanes, excessively slow vehicles, aggressive driving, tailgating, and sharp braking. Lorenz and Elefteriadou (2001) estimate that as flow increases from 1900 to 2200 vphpl the probability of breakdown increases by 50 percentage points. The magnitude of the breakdown appears to be quite large, with documented declines in capacity of 25% (Persaud et al., 1998).====This paper’s contribution is to analyze how to implement tolls in the face of this endogenous non-recurring congestion. We do so by extending the bottleneck model of dynamic congestion (Vickrey, 1969, Arnott, de Palma, Lindsey, et al., 1993) to allow for an endogenous probability of breakdown, where the probability is increasing in the flow.====To keep the analysis tractable, we limit the space of possible toll schedules to a commonly observed class of tolls: Preset toll schedules that vary by time of day to keep traffic flow from exceeding a target maximum. For example, California’s SR-91 Express Lanes have a stated maximum average flow of 1600 vphpl.==== Other facilities implicitly have a maximum flow target because they aim to achieve a set minimum average vehicle speed. The majority of facilities in the United States with time-varying tolls have a preset schedule.==== These tolls are anticipatory, and differ from dynamic tolls which respond in real time to realized traffic levels. Dynamic tolls, with one exception, have only been used when pricing a portion of the lanes, because for dynamic tolls to be effective drivers need to have the ability to immediately choose an alternate route, or cancel or delay their trip.====We find two important results. First, tolls should be higher, and maximum flow lower, than we might naïvely expect. We use as the naïve benchmark the toll schedule which maximizes expected throughput.==== Increasing the toll to reduce the maximum flow rate below that which maximizes expected throughput has a cost: It increases the length of the peak period. However, it has two benefits: It reduces the probability of breakdown, and it reduces the severity of congestion on days breakdown occurs by spreading out when drivers depart.====Second, tolling leaves homogeneous drivers better off, even before the resulting revenue is used. Furthermore, providing that the probability of breakdown when the road is untolled is not too high, the improvement in drivers’ private costs occurs despite a reduction in the average flow rate relative to when no tolls were charged. This is due to drivers valuing the reduction in uncertainty and travel time more than they dislike paying the toll. Leaving drivers better off is important as a major barrier to implementing tolling is the concern that it hurts drivers.==== While drivers are, in reality, heterogeneous, this result highlights that accounting for the value drivers place on reliability improves the welfare consequences of tolling.====We simulate our model using parameter values from Lorenz and Elefteriadou (2001), U.S. Department of Transporation (2016), and Hall (2019b). Our simulations suggest that the socially optimal maximum departure rate is 14% below that which maximizes expected throughput, with the average toll more than three times those which maximize expected throughput.

However, for example, in Paris MA, (ii) the rich reside in the central city. Furthermore, it is sometimes observed in Japanese MAs that (iii) the rich and poor colocate in the central city, while the middle class locates in the suburbs. It may also be possible that (iv) different income groups coexist and consume different housing sizes in the same location in a city. Patterns (i) and (ii) represent ==== whereas patterns (iii) and (iv) ====.====These segregation patterns may be explained by the monocentric city model developed by Alonso (1964).==== Whether the rich live near the central business district (CBD) or in the suburbs is given by the impact of income on the bid-rent slope as follows====where the prime is the derivative with respect to commuting distance ==== the land rent per space, ==== the commuting cost, ==== the hourly wage that differs by the heterogeneity of workers, ==== the housing space, and ε represents the elasticities of ==== and ====′ with respect to ==== Rosenthal and Ross (2015).====If ∂====′/∂==== > 0, then the bid-rent gradient ====′ of the poorer households is steeper, and hence, the poorer residents locate closer to the CBD, thus following pattern (i). This implies that as the wages of low-income households increase, they tend to relocate to the suburbs. The literature indicates that central cities tend to house low-income households relative to the suburbs in the US (Ihlanfeldt, Young, 1994, Timothy, Wheaton, 2001, Rosenthal, Ross, 2015), the UK (Cuberes and Roberts, 2015) and China (Zhu et al., 2017). This may be due to the limited access to public transit in the suburbs (LeRoy, Sonstelie, 1983, Glaeser, Kahn, Rappaport, 2008), deteriorating housing stocks near the city center (Brueckner and Rosenthal, 2009), or neighborhood effects (Pfeiffer et al., 2019).====On the other hand, if ∂====′/∂==== < 0, then the poorer residents locate farther from the CBD, meaning that as household wages increase, they tend to locate into the CBD, according to pattern (ii). Under both patterns, different income households do not colocate in the same location. In fact, the census tracts closest to the city center are often among the richest in US MAs (Glaeser et al., 2008). Furthermore, Benito and Oswald (2000) found a negative relationship between commuting times and hourly pay in UK cities, while (Gutiérrez-i-Puigarnau et al., 2016) found a negative effect of household income on commuting distance in Danish cities. This may be explained by the social amenities in a central city, such as downtown Paris, which attract the wealthy (Brueckner, Thisse, Zenou, 1999, Gaigné, Moizeau, Thisse, 2019) or gentrification near the city center (Brueckner and Rosenthal, 2009).====In this paper, we observe (iii) the colocation of the rich and poor in the central city, as well as (iv) the coexistence of different income groups in Japanese cities. That is, we do not test whether the rich reside close to or farther from the CBD, but rather explore a third possibilities:====, which is in sharp contrast to the literature. For this purpose, we reconsider Eq. (1) in Section 2 by introducing the time cost of commuting into Alonso’s model. This is because the differences in commuting costs and housing demand elasticities affect the location decisions of different income groups through the urban housing market.====We reveal the spatial distribution of income classes in a large city by examining microdata on housing prices and rents in Tokyo MA Transport Planning Council. We find that the rich and poor tend to colocate and are sorted by income near the central city according to microdata on detached-housing prices, as shown in Section 3.2; moreover different income groups colocate according to microdata on condominium prices in Section 3.3. This is because, in Japan, the income elasticity of demand for condominium space is close to one and the pecuniary costs of commuting are normally covered by employers in Japan unlike in other countries.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows, in the next section, we extend Alonso’s monocentric city model by incorporating leisure time into the utility function and considering trade-offs among leisure, commuting and working times. We show that the rich and poor tend to colocate near the CBD and different income groups colocate regardless of location under certain conditions. In the subsequent section, we test our propositions and empirically show that the rich and poor tend to colocate near the CBD, while the middle class locates in the suburbs for detached-housing residents. However, different income groups colocate for condominium residents. Finally, we provide empirical evidence of these results by using apartment rent microdata in Tokyo MA.

Yet, a revenue windfall is often only temporary, turning into a shortfall with little warning. This is frequently the case when a government is overly reliant on volatile revenue sources. A good example is that of California and the state budget's excessive reliance on capital gains taxes, which makes the evolution of revenues especially sensitive to stock market developments. Likewise, the collapse of the housing market in Spain generated similar problems for local governments that had become excessively reliant on construction-related revenues. Such situations require prudent fiscal management: windfall revenues obtained during a boom should, for the most part, be saved. The consequence of failing to save during the boom is fiscal stress during the bust when these revenues vanish, leading to abrupt cuts in spending and to deterioration in public services and/or to tax increases. Two excerpts from the Spanish media illustrate the situation during the boom-bust cycle, respectively:====Here, we study how local governments react to temporary revenue windfalls attributable to asset booms. Earlier papers examining the ability of local governments to smooth spending faced the challenge of ensuring that actual revenue changes were not capturing the effects of permanent revenue shocks. Our main contribution in this paper, therefore, is to overcome this problem by confirming the temporary nature of the windfall revenues. To do so, we draw on data from Spanish local governments for the period 1995–2011, years in which these governments were affected by a huge, unexpected, temporary fluctuation in their revenues, attributable to the housing boom and bust. The reason for this abrupt swing lies in the fact that Spanish municipalities obtain a large share of their revenues from property transaction taxes, including a betterment tax, a tax on construction budgets, development and building permit fees, and land sales income (see Section 3).====Using data from local governments in Spain's largest urban areas, we perform three different analyses. First, we study the average reaction to the boom windfall. To this end, we estimate a first-differences equation that relates the change in expenditures from the start to the peak of the boom to the change in construction-related revenues during the same period. Our preferred result is obtained from an equation estimated by two-stage least squares (2SLS), using the amount of vacant land (i.e., land legally classified as developable but not yet developed) at the beginning of the boom period as an instrument. Our results show that a large share of the windfall (around 70%) was used to fund spending increases. The remainder was saved for the lean times ahead, as we do not find any evidence of a significant adjustment in other margins (e.g., taxes or grants). Current spending was the most heavily affected item (accounting for 50% of the windfall) and, in particular, spending on personnel (30%).====Second, we seek to identify which local governments are most prone to spending their windfall revenues during booms. Specifically, we investigate whether this behaviour is attributable to political myopia or to extrapolation bias. To examine the first mechanism, we consider the possibility that local incumbents increase expenditures to convince uninformed voters about their competence when elections are highly competitive. Our results provide support for this mechanism: local incumbents that won the elections by a narrow margin have a higher propensity to spend. To assess the second mechanism, we examine whether the propensity to spend is due to the overstatement of the long-run persistence of the revenue shock. We find that municipalities that experienced high volatility in the housing construction sector in previous boom-bust cycles do have a lower propensity to spend.====Finally, we also examine how local governments cope with the loss of construction revenues during a bust. We find that construction revenue shortfalls were followed by abrupt cuts in spending (around 70%), tax increases (10%) and deficit spending (the remaining 20%). Personnel expenditures were not cut at all, the bulk of the adjustment falling on capital spending. Thus, after the complete housing boom-bust cycle, cities that had enjoyed larger construction revenue windfalls ended up with larger deficits, higher taxes, and an expenditure budget biased towards current (especially personnel) spending. Moreover, the adjustment seems to have been stronger in those municipalities that overspent most during the boom (those without past experience of volatility and with narrow margins of victory). As such, it would appear that overspending during the boom years created considerable stress during the bust.====The paper contributes to various strands in the literature. First, there are the works that study whether local governments are forward-looking agents (see Holtz-Eakin et al., 1994, Dahlberg and Lindström, 1998, Børge and Tovmo, 2009, Persson, 2016). These papers estimate the response of public consumption to actual changes in tax revenues using dynamic panel data methods to isolate the temporary shock. We enhance this approach by using a new identification strategy. We also explore in greater depth the mechanisms that might account for the results. For instance, these papers do not take into account the effect of the persistence of the revenue shock (as is now customary in the private consumption literature, see, e.g., Sørensen and Luengo-Prado, 2008) and rarely consider political economy explanations (though see Børge and Tovmo, 2009, by way of exception).====Second, the paper is related to recent studies in political economy examining electorally induced policy myopia. See, for example, Bonfiglioni and Gancia (2013) on the incentives to delay reforms, Matsen et al. (2016) on the over-exploitation of natural resources, Bagchi (2016) on pension under-funding, and Pérignon and Vallée (2017) on local government loan choices that conceal the cost of debt.==== In these papers, contested elections generate incentives to focus on the short-run policy effects. We extend this literature by studying the effects of electoral competition on the fiscal response to volatility.====Finally, the paper also contributes to our understanding of the causes and effects of housing booms and busts. Several papers have already highlighted the role of buyers’ expectations during booms (Glaeser and Nathanson, 2015 and 2017). Other papers study the effects of the ups and downs of housing prices on household consumption (Mian et al., 2013). There are also several studies that examine the effect of the last housing boom on local public finances in the U.S.: Vlaicu and Whalley, 2011, Alm et al., 2011, Lutz et al., 2011 and Ihlanfeldt and Doerner (2011). The paper most similar to ours is the one by Davis and Ferreira (2018). The authors leverage variation from the trend break in housing prices across U.S. metro areas during the boom (see also Ferreira and Gyourko, 2018) to study the effect of increases in property tax collections on school spending.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a theoretical framework that helps interpret the findings. Section 3 provides some institutional background on Spain. Section 4 presents the data and describes the empirical specification. Section 5 presents the results.

Does such potential antagonism translate into residential dynamics? We study whether natives fled from immigrant areas in reaction to the largest and fastest migration shock in the ====. The inflow–causing the population of Spain to grow by 10% between 1998 and 2008–represented a largely new phenomenon, the size of which had not been factored into previous expectations, thereby providing quasi-experimental sources of variance. Our results show that immigrant inflows caused mild native displacement from denser, established neighborhoods, but also more real estate development in these areas. In parallel, both natives and immigrants were collocating in booming suburban communities, resulting in no changes to overall measures of ethnic segregation. In light of the results, we argue that whenever ethnic-minority arrivals spur the creation of new neighborhoods, conventional empirical methods overstate the degree of native flight.","International migration has become one of the central political issues of our time. The population share of the foreign-born in high-income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries increased by approximately 1 percentage point every five years between 1990 and 2010: from 7% to 11% (World Bank, 2013). This has led economists to investigate how immigrants affect destination economies. Most studies—focusing on labor markets—arguably show that the wage impacts on natives are relatively small.====Nevertheless, attitudes towards immigrants depend on other issues, such as their impact on welfare benefits or ethnic identities (Dustmann and Preston, 2007). Some researchers, like Borjas (2013) or Saiz and Wachter (2011), claim that the largest impacts of immigration may not be found in the labor market but rather in other interaction spaces between natives and immigrants. After all, robotization, capital deepening, Information Technologies, Artificial Intelligence, trade, global outsourcing, and off-shoring, have also profound impacts on employment, wages, and the labor market. Yet these shocks to labor demand and supply do not seem to galvanize opinion in the same way as immigration. This may suggest that the residential aspects of this phenomenon are perceived as critically-important by natives. In this context, we need to study where immigrants settle, and how their settlement decisions affect natives’ residential choices.====To this end, we focus on one of the world’s largest and swiftest immigration experiences. In only ten years, between 1998 and 2008, the immigrant population share in Spain increased from 3% to 13%. We perform a comprehensive study of natives’ residential responses, combining microdata on exact addresses of the resident population with distance to amenities and socioeconomic characteristics by neighborhood. Building on Saiz and Wachter (2011) and Kasy (2015), we construct instrumental variables (IV) based on the geographic diffusion of immigrant inflows to estimate the causal impact of the latter on natives’ outflows.====In an environment of massive, ex novo inflows, we find that: (i) immigrants mildly displaced natives from city centers and dense suburban areas: one native leaving for every three immigrants moving in; and (ii) residential construction also increased in established neighborhoods with more immigrant arrivals. We argue that these facts are inconsistent with the existence of strong native discriminatory residential behavior. We also show that: (iii) new housing developments in suburban areas saw proportional collocation of immigrants and natives; and (iv) the resulting effect on average immigrant segregation was neutral. The results point to dynamics that are not always captured by conventional tipping and segregation models, which assume a fixed number of neighborhoods, often ignoring the role of new real estate development.====Most recent literature on the effect of ethnic displacement has centered on the US, e.g. Cutler et al. (2008), Card et al. (2008) and Saiz and Wachter (2011), where migrant inflows into cities have been progressive and continuous. The richness of our original dataset is similar to that in Scandinavian studies. Denmark and Sweden have also been very gradual net recipients of migrant flows and studied by Edin et al. (2003) or Damm (2009). In parallel to our research, Andersson et al. (2018) study the process of native flight from neighborhoods that received refugee settlement in Sweden, finding that each immigrant displaced 0.3 natives on average.====There are a number of papers dealing with the measurement of residential segregation in Spain, but none of them analyzes the causal reaction of natives to localized immigrant arrivals.==== In contrast to most of the previous literature, our geocoded data allow us to study the phenomenon in a context where its magnitude and speed were very sizable and unpredicted. Furthermore, we have very detailed micro data on immigrant and native locations, and a much broader coverage of the neighborhood characteristics that could have impacted native mobility even in the absence of migratory flows. Therefore, our results are less likely to be plagued by omitted-variable bias.====The immigration wave in Spain was contemporaneous to a housing boom (Nicodemo and Raya, 2012), not coincidentally. González and Ortega (2013) use inter-regional variation to find that ==== (2000–2010). We focus on neighborhood-level variation, where comprehensive data on prices during that period do not exist. Our estimates of the effect of immigrant arrivals on native mobility are therefore reduced-form, comprising both: (i) native preferences for neighborhood ethnic composition; and (ii) equilibrium effects by way of changes in housing prices and their interactions with native price elasticities of substitution between neighborhoods. Nevertheless, we do exploit data on residential housing construction, which turns out to be a critical issue. Studies in the ethnic segregation literature that abstract from housing supply effects—for instance by chiefly focusing on changes in racial shares—may therefore be lacking. We argue that, in rapidly growing cities, we need to study relative demographic inflows and new housing construction concurrently.====The next section describes and benchmarks the immigration boom. In Section 3, we document the construction of our database, sketch our methodology, and show summary statistics. Section 4 presents our main empirical estimates and relates them to the emergence of new metropolitan suburbs.

Their advantage over rural parishes consisted in having ==== rights to trade with the local hinterland. Since the optimum sites were occupied by medieval towns, the Crown could only aim for second-rate locations. Using difference-in-difference combined with ====, we find that a reduction in the distance to town increased gross production and population up to 30–40 km away. However, there is no evidence of increasing per capita production or yields. These natural constraints could only support a sluggish growth in the towns themselves. However, after the Industrial Revolution, the towns began to thrive. We argue that town status signalled the commitment of the Crown to nurture these locations creating positive expectations despite their natural constraints. During industrialization, ==== led them to become significantly large urban areas persistent until today.","Can placed-based policies create persistent effects on local economies? Can these prevail when the policy has ended? Can towns that are created by administrative fiat, often in sub-optimal locations, become vibrant urban centers? The leading theory explaining the spatial distribution of population argues that locational fundamentals helped by increasing returns determine spatial differences. Consequently, locations with natural advantages became early developers whilst those which gained artificial advantages from policies or technological shocks lagged behind with respect to increasing returns. For example, Davis and Weinstein (2002) demonstrate the persistence of natural advantages to determine the distribution of economic activity even after the destruction of Japanese cities during WW2; Bleakley and Lin (2012) show that portage sites persisted to become large metropolitan areas even after their initial advantage became irrelevant.====There is a growing debate on the potential effects of place-based policies in the long term (see Kline, Moretti, 2013, Kline, Moretti, 2014) driving academic pressure from economists, historians and human geographers to pursue the analysis of their conditions and driving mechanisms.==== In a world determined by first nature advantages, place-based policies will not have any long-term consequences. However, theory explains that policy shocks can have a long-term impact when not only location but also scale matters. However, the shock needs to be substantial enough to generate increasing returns. Analyzing whether a policy has effects in the longer term requires access to historical data. In this context, the role of place-based policies in the long run is widely unstudied and theorists have managed only very basic consensus on their mixed effects. Our study deals with a series of town foundations in Sweden between 1570 and 1810, whose main advantage was the monopoly power on trade over their hinterlands.====We present several breakthroughs related to this literature. First, while studies have focused on the impact of local infrastructure investment on the long-term impact on urbanization (Kline, Moretti, 2013, Jedwab, Kerby, Moradi, 2015, Jedwab, Moradi, 2016, Berger, Enflo, 2017), we focus on urbanization as a place-based policy ====. Arguing that founded towns created a local shock in terms of monopoly rights to trade, we measure urban spillovers in the surrounding hinterlands at the extensive (gross production and population) and intensive margin (production per capita and agricultural yields). As such, our study digs deeper into the economic function of early modern urbanization and estimates the size of the local spillovers before the introduction of modern transportation technologies.====Second, we deal with the mechanisms contributing to the long-term persistence of towns. While previous papers demonstrate persistence policies ==== initial advantages have become obsolete (Bleakley, Lin, 2012, Jedwab, Moradi, 2016, Jedwab, Kerby, Moradi, 2015), we demonstrate the persistence of town foundations ==== their initial advantage disappeared. We show that their monopoly trading rights and sunk investments increased expectations about future growth, leading to the clustering of population and the eventual effect of agglomeration economies. This result echoes the importance of the emergence of increasing returns in non-urbanized regions. While previous studies have demonstrated the effects for colonial Africa (Jedwab, Moradi, 2016, Jedwab, Kerby, Moradi, 2015), our study provides a case of long-term urban persistence in a context of initial stagnation that was eventually followed by more than a century of modern economic growth in Europe.====Third, we offer quantitative evidence on the importance of natural and agglomeration advantages at several stages of development. Seminal works on urbanization have underlined the importance of agricultural conditions in explaining the emergence of pre-industrial towns constrained by high transportation costs (Bairoch, et al., 1991, De Vries, 2006, Childe, 1935, Wrigley, 2016). Lately, Henderson et al. (2017) have shown that falling transportation costs have helped urban locations in late developers to be less affected by local agricultural constrains than in early developers. Our study adds to this novel literature by establishing the initial organic constraint of towns as well as their subsequent escape due to economic and institutional developments in the 19th century. By doing so, we go well beyond the existing economic account of the Swedish towns foundations that we are aware of (Heckscher, 1963). While Eli Heckscher (1963) [p. 50] described the Swedish town foundations policy as a failure by stating that ====, we use quantitative methods to establish the mechanisms for their short-run failure as well as their persistence to date.====Town foundations were motivated by the Crown’s attempts to modernize Sweden. We analyze the effects of 31 new town locations that were founded between 1570 and 1810 (represented in Fig. 1). The cases of Kristianopel and Karlskrona serve as fine examples. King Christian IV of Denmark founded Kristianopel when the southernmost part of Sweden belonged to his realm. The honor of giving the town such a name displays the king’s hopes that the site would become ====. After Sweden acquired the territory from Denmark in 1658, King Karl XI of Sweden removed Kristianopel’s town charters in favor of Karlskrona, some 35 km away. Both locations exist: Kristianopel is a village populated by less than a hundred inhabitants, administratively managed by the thriving community of Karlskrona. The latter has notoriously grown from 4000 people when it was founded to more than 60,000 today.==== Karlskrona ranked 34th in terms of population according to Statistics Sweden in 2015. This position is explained by its relatively recent origin compared to medieval or earlier population clusters, and by the fact that the hinterlands could sustain only a sluggish growth before the industrial revolution. Therefore, path-dependency from the privileged locations explain regional patterns of population even in places that lacked natural advantages.====Section 2 describes how urban growth dynamics respond to shocks before the industrial revolution and discusses the mechanisms of persistence suggested in the literature. Section 3 builds on the randomness of the Swedish urban policy and explains how the town foundations act as a random shock to the neighboring parishes. We provide a description of the data in Section 4. In Section 5, we measure the size of local spillovers in terms of the kilometers distance to a town allowing for time lags to capture the dynamics. To adjust for the fact that these parishes were only second-rate locations compared to the medieval towns which grew organically, we use Propensity Score Matching to find comparable counterfactuals based on soil quality, distance to the closest medieval town, to the coast, and to the contemporary capital of Finland (Turku). Section 6 demonstrates that, although the founded towns were marginally larger than comparable rural parishes by 1810, the effects of population size and pre-industrial agglomeration were not decisive factors in driving long-term growth. We investigate alternative channels of long-run persistence pertaining to population compositions and sunk investments in infrastructure. Our results indicate that, by 1810, the founded towns were over-endowed with infrastructure. However, such over-endowment of slowly depreciating infrastructure was not the mechanism driving persistence. Instead, the size of the population in year 2000 was explained almost entirely by the effects of the population size in 1900. Thus, initial trade privileges and infrastructure served to coordinate people in the new locations. After industrialization, agglomeration forces took over as the main mechanism driving the persistence of towns.

This question has been at the center of debates in the fiscal federalism literature, and is becoming increasingly important given the global trend to fiscally decentralize. Previous empirical and theoretical studies addressing this question have considered the reactions to such shocks by the average state.==== However, major cross-state differences are observed in virtually all federations. This reflects on the potential heterogeneous reactions to changes in federal taxes. While such changes are uniform across the nation, their effects are not. We make a first attempt to investigate these potentially different reactions and their implications by focusing on one margin, namely natural riches that induce ====, a term we define below. We show, theoretically and empirically, via the case of the U.S., that due to the fiscal advantage borne by their resources, natural resource rich states are able to respond more competitively to federal tax increases, and as a result benefit from capital inflows that may raise their tax base –even without reinvestment of the taxes levied– and thus increase fiscal inequality across the nation.====More generally, this paper presents a novel mechanism of heterogeneous vertical tax externalities across levels of fiscal advantage.==== We define the latter to be the level of income that states receive from non-mobile sources. States rich in non-mobile factors have more flexibility in taxing mobile tax bases, giving them an advantage in the inter-state fiscal competition. A potentially major non-mobile income source is natural resources, which we use to proxy for fiscal advantage.==== Natural resources are non-mobile given their inherent geographical characteristics. In addition, unlike other non-mobile income sources they represent a significant source of revenues for certain states, as depicted in Fig. 1 for the case of U.S. states,==== and their (persistent) abundance is based on plausibly exogenous geological features. Evidence for the fiscal advantage borne by natural resources is given, for example, by James (2015) and Raveh (2013) who find that the income from natural riches enables U.S. states to charge lower tax rates on mobile factors, and present a more competitive fiscal environment.==== Similar patterns are also observed in Russian states (Cai and Treisman, 2005), and Chinese provinces (Yao and Zhang, 2008).====Our main hypothesis is that the vertical fiscal response to federal tax shocks is relatively more inelastic in fiscally advantageous states. To examine this conjecture, and its implications, we construct a model of heterogeneous vertical tax externalities. Motivated by Brulhart and Jametti (2006), we add heterogeneity in fiscal advantage levels to an otherwise standard model of vertical tax externalities and horizontal tax competition. The model captures the case of a closed, two-level, federation with complementary state and federal public good provision, where state governments compete for the nation’s capital stock, focusing on capital taxation and movement – features that we substantiate in the empirical part. The analysis outlines how fiscal advantage affects the reaction of states’ capital tax rates to federal tax shocks, and the patterns of cross-state capital reallocation that follow.====A central feature of the model is the existence of horizontal capital tax competition with varying levels of fiscal advantage. Under this framework, the natural resource rich states exploit the fiscal advantage borne by their resources to compete more aggressively in the inter-state competition over capital. Greater capital tax reductions allow them to attract capital from the other states, and end up with a larger per capita capital stock in equilibrium. An important vertical implication, under the assumption that state and federal public goods are complementary, is that high fiscal advantage states respond to a federal tax increase with smaller relative capital tax increases, which lead to further capital movement towards them.==== The intuition is simple: having a larger per capita tax base, the high fiscal advantage states can maintain the same level of public good provision with smaller tax increases.====The analysis indicates that with sufficient capital inflows a federal tax increase may actually ==== the capital tax base in fiscally advantaged states, and in turn also increase their output – irrespective of federal redistribution. This sheds new light on the standard result in the literature that, controlling for reinvestment of taxes levied, tax increases necessarily contract the tax base and output. Another implication of this is that some states may benefit from federal tax increases on the account of other states for which such increases are harmful, hence increasing fiscal inequality across the nation.====The empirical part of the paper tests the predictions of the theory, and provides evidence for some of its main features. We undertake an inter-state analysis of the U.S. economy using an annual-based panel covering the period 1963–2007. This analysis is based on two key variables: fiscal advantage and federal tax shocks. We measure fiscal advantage levels using the share of severance taxes in states’ total tax revenues.==== Fig. 1 shows the distribution of this variable across U.S. states for our sample period (1963–2007). A significant cross-state heterogeneity is apparent, ranging from 0 (in Vermont and Rhode Island, for instance) to more than 0.4 (in Alaska). We exploit this variation in the empirical analysis.====Moving to the second key variable of our analysis, we use data on narrative-based measures of U.S. federal tax shocks from Romer and Romer (2010) (henceforth, RR), aggregated to an annual-level. RR employ narrative sources such as presidential speeches and federal reports, among others, to classify the motivation of major federal tax changes into endogenous and exogenous, and estimate their effect on federal tax revenue. Our focus is on those shocks that they classified as exogenous to address related endogeneity concerns;==== this stands at the heart of our identification strategy. In addition, to motivate the emphasis on capital in the model, we divide these tax shocks to corporate-related and non-corporate-related based on the methodology set in Reingewertz (2018). We elaborate on these points in the empirical part.====We concentrate primarily on the interaction of the two to address a set of questions that follow the various stages of the model. We first ask whether natural resource rich states present a more competitive fiscal environment, and whether this translates into having larger per capita capital stocks. We provide supporting evidence, some based on previous work, that this is the case. Thereafter, we turn to the main analysis to examine the effects of federal tax shocks across levels of fiscal advantage. We begin this section with an event study analysis that examines the impacts on changes in state average tax rates, real capital stock per capita, population, and real output per capita in the three years prior and four years past a major corporate-related federal tax change across fiscally advantaged and non-fiscally advantaged state groups.==== The results reveal a common-trend prior to an event, which changes thereafter; specifically, in the fiscally advantaged states tax rates do not change, and capital and output increase, whereas in the remaining states tax rates increase and capital and output drop, most notably in the two years past the event.====To examine this in more detail under the full variation of the tax shocks and fiscal advantage levels, we focus on a one-year lag, and estimate the heterogeneous effects of a federal tax shock under a panel fixed-effects framework in which the treatment is interacted with fiscal advantage. Our results support the various aspects of the mechanism. Specifically, controlling for the reinvestment of the taxes levied, we find that following a federal tax increase, high fiscal advantage states: a) do not change their tax rates, unlike the other states that increase them; b) benefit from capital inflows to the extent of increasing their pre-shock per capita capital stock; c) experience an increase in output. These patterns, which indicate that federal tax increases can be beneficial for fiscally advantaged states, are observed using different measures of tax rates, capital inflows, and resource abundance, as well as different specifications and time periods.====The model emphasizes capital tax competition and capital mobility as the instruments through which the mechanism works. To substantiate this, we divide the empirical analysis to capital and non-capital related factors, wherever possible, by making several disaggregations, in addition to that of the tax shocks. Specifically, we look into state corporate and non-corporate tax rates and revenues, and we distinguish between firm and labor movements across states. Results indicate that the various aspects of the mechanism are completely driven by the capital-related shocks and effects. Consistent with the model, it is the corporate-related federal shocks that affect capital tax rates, revenues, and movement, with no observed effects on the labor side. Our baseline estimates indicate that, controlling for federal transfers, a 1% increase in the GDP share of corporate-related federal taxes ==== the per capita tax base growth rate by approximately 0.7% in high fiscal advantage states in the year that follows.====This paper contributes to various strands of literature. First is the literature on fiscal equalization and disparities. As discussed in Qiao (1999), inter-state fiscal disparities are considered a major concern in federations, creating equity and efficiency related challenges. Boadway (2004), Boadway and Shah (2009), and Martinez-Vazquez and Searle (2007) summarize these challenges and the measures taken by federal governments to address them, most notably through equalization schemes. Little attention, however, has been given to the role of federal tax policy in this. Albouy (2009) discusses the unequal burden of federal taxation across states, and then illustrates in Albouy (2012) that this may interact with fiscal inequality and equalization incentives. We contribute to this literature by showing that federal tax coordination can exacerbate fiscal disparities across the nation via the cross-state capital reallocation that follows, hence posing equalization-related challenges not considered previously.====Second is the literature on tax changes, output, and the macroeconomy. This vast literature, surveyed by Gale and Orszag (2004), Hebous (2011), and (Ramey, 2011), studies the medium and long-run effects of fiscal shocks on the macroeconomy, including output and composition of GDP, emphasizing their contracting nature and role in crowding out investment. Additional related studies examine similar links between federal fiscal shocks and state-level effects, including (Chodorow-Reich, Feiveson, Liscow, Woolston, 2012, Clemens, Miran, 2012, Fishback, Kachanovskaya, Hayo, Uhl, 2015, Nakamura, Steinsson, 2014, Owyang, Zubairy, Shoag, Serrato, Wingender, Taylor, Yucel, Wilson, 2012). In contrast to these studies our focus is on differential state-tax reactions to federal shocks, and the resulting implications. Our contribution to this literature is twofold. First, we show that tax increases can be expansionary in some states, both to the tax base as well as to output, even without the reinvestment of tax revenues. This, in turn, can help to explain the wide confidence bands that RR find on their estimates. Second, the horizontal channel we highlight, via factor reallocation across the nation, potentially sheds light on the national level outcomes in output and investment discussed in these previous studies.====Third is the literature on the effects of resource booms in fiscally decentralized, federalized economies, and the more general natural resource curse hypothesis. Van der Ploeg and Poelhekke (2016) provide a synthesis of the empirical literature on the local effects of resource shocks. Various studies look more specifically into the state-level fiscal effects of resource booms, including (Boadway, 2006, James, 2015, Raveh, 2013). Notably, standard models of the resource curse, which provide the conceptual foundations for these studies, assume a single centralized system of public finance. Conversely, the current effort examines the implications of cross-state differences in resource abundance in a system of fiscal federalism. A similar perspective is adopted by Perez-Sebastian and Raveh (2016), who show that resource-driven asymmetric fiscal shocks in a federation may yield resource curse effects via inefficient factor reallocation across states. The current analysis, however, focuses on the roles of federal fiscal policy and vertical tax externalities in driving this mechanism.====Last is the theoretical literature on horizontal and vertical tax competition. Some studies look into a horizontal population-based asymmetric tax competition (Bucovetsky, 1991, Kanbur, Keen, 1993, Wilson, 1991) or otherwise a horizontal asymmetry in natural resource wealth (Raveh, 2013, Perez-Sebastian, Raveh, 2016), while others look into vertical tax competition under symmetric settings (Dahlby, Wilson, 2003, Hoyt, 2001, Keen, 1998). In this paper we study concurrent asymmetric vertical and horizontal tax competition, where the asymmetry is sourced at the horizontal level via cross-state differences in fiscal advantage. Through this, we highlight the role of the horizontal channel when considering vertical shocks.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the analytical framework. Section 3 presents the empirical analysis, providing evidence for the mechanism.

For example, when information is costly or imperfect, sub-optimal welfare is likely to be attained, and market equilibrium may exhibit price dispersion even for homogeneous goods (see, e.g., Stiglitz, 1985, 1961, respectively).==== However, while a great deal of theoretical and empirical research has been devoted to understanding the effect of information on prices, only limited empirical work has been undertaken to date on the specific effect of information shocks on price dispersion of goods.====An exception to this trend is a study by Jensen (2007) on the effect of improved information technology shock on price dispersion and welfare in the fishing industry in Kerala, India. According to Jensen (2007), information shock that was associated with the introduction of mobile phone service to fishermen and wholesalers has led to a reduction in price dispersion in the South Indian fisheries sector. (Similarly, Aker, 2010 finds that the introduction of mobile phone services reduced price dispersion across grain markets in Niger.)====A recent experience in the Israeli real estate market serves as a natural experiment for further exploring the effect of information availability on price dispersion in a market of non-homogeneous goods where transactions carry considerable long-term, economic consequences. Specifically, in 2010, an Israeli court ordered the Israel Tax Authority to open its records to the public on all past and current real estate transactions. For the first time, price and other related real estate transaction information was disclosed to market participants and was freely accessed through the Tax Authority's website.====We study the effect of this exogenous information shock on the price dispersion of subsequent housing transactions. In particular, by observing all market transaction prices prior and subsequent to the improved information shock, we estimate the controlled change in the dispersion of quality-adjusted housing prices over time and across locations. We further examine the sensitivity of the estimated price dispersion effect to household socioeconomic (SES) status and housing asset heterogeneity in the market. As our framework only allows for a before/after-type test (as the new information disclosure was implemented nationwide), we conduct a series of identification and robustness checks for our findings. These tests include using rental housing transactions as a control group; changing the scope of the geographical areas for which price dispersion is estimated; quantitatively assessing the degree of potential unobservable variable bias along the lines of Altonji et al. (2005); and applying placebo as well as nonparametric tests.====Our results provide evidence of decreased price dispersion that follows the exogenous public disclosure of transaction price information. Specifically, over various test specifications, we find that standard deviation of quality-adjusted (hedonic) prices decreased by about 18% subsequent to the improved information shock. Moreover, applying the Altonji et al. (2005) method for testing whether unobservable variables can explain the decreased price dispersion effect, we find that the normalized shift in the distribution of the unobservables should be about 2.8 (6.3) greater than the normalized shift in the distribution of the treatment (the observed information shock) to nullify the entire 3- (1-) year pre/post effect of the shock. Placebo and nonparametric tests further support our outcomes on the significant decreased price dispersion that follows the information shock.====In addition, we find that the magnitude of the effect of improved information shock on decreased price dispersion is negatively correlated with household SES level in the market. This is consistent with the notion that market participants in less privileged areas, having limited access to means that may ameliorate information shortage, are experiencing a greater effect of the improved public information. We also find that the magnitude of the improved information shock effect is positively correlated with asset heterogeneity in high SES markets (consistent with Kurlat and Stroebel, 2015—see further discussion in Section 7 below). Our results are robust to a series of sampling and test-design issues.====The intuition underlying the empirical results is that, in a market with imperfect price information (as compared to a market with perfect price information), the seller and the potential buyer may arrive at the negotiation when they observe different subsets of current housing transactions (i.e., they are equipped with different information sets regarding ongoing market prices). Not only does the latter decrease the likelihood of successfully reaching an agreed-upon closing price, but also, since the underlying (imperfect) information sets serving the parties in one transaction may differ from the information sets observed by the parties in another concurrent transaction, different closing prices might attain, ====—leading to a greater price dispersion under imperfect price information. In the context of our empirical framework, the increased information access provided to market participants by the Israel Tax Authority should thus likely lead to a narrowing of price dispersion among housing transactions.====A number of studies specifically examine the importance of information in the real estate market. Garmaise and Moskowitz (2004) show how market participants tend to purchase nearby assets, trade properties with long income histories, and avoid deals with informed brokers in order to resolve information asymmetries. Levitt and Syverson (2008) further quantify housing price information: informed, as compared to uninformed, sellers (real estate agents versus home sellers, respectively) sell their own properties more patiently, attaining higher prices. Kurlat and Stroebel (2015) further show that the share of informed sellers may predict future price declines, while informed buyers obtain greater price appreciation in the housing market.====The primary contributions of this research are as follows. First, we extend Jensen's (2007) and Aker's (2010) evidence on the price dispersion effect of information shock by not only examining a different type of information shock, but also showing that the effect carries over into a market in which transactions involve considerable personal economic consequences. Moreover, we show that the extent of the decreased price dispersion that follows the improved information shock associates with household and asset characteristics in the market.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides further institutional background on the Israeli real estate market and the exogenous information shock. Section 3 describes the data and Section 4 describes the basic methodology. Section 5 presents the results and Section 6 presents a series of identification and robustness tests. Section 7 presents the sensitivity of the results to household and market characteristics.

This is one of the largest grant-in-kind initiatives in the country’s history, accounting for over $5.2 billion in transferred goods and vehicles since 1997. Two features of this program are unique among ","Intergovernmental transfers are a key source of funds to local governments. The National League of Cities reports that approximately 5 percent of municipal budgets comes through the federal government, while an additional 30–40 percent of local government revenues comes from states.==== The motivation for and structure of grant programs are both important because this external funding will affect the allocation of local public resources, overall local spending, and subsequent welfare. In some cases grants may be used to redistribute resources from high-income to low-income areas, in turn addressing differentials in local tax capacity. In other instances, local government provision of a public good may be preferable to state or federal provision, either due to diseconomies of scale or heterogeneity in preferences between local jurisdictions. In these circumstances, providing grants to local governments for the provision of a particular service may generate more welfare than the federal government providing the service directly. Grants are also widely used to address interjurisdictional spillovers (as with transportation infrastructure), and they may serve as a lever for paternalistic oversight from higher levels of government in a federalist system. If local preferences lead to too little spending on a public good, state or national agencies may choose to encourage more provision through grants.====The underlying motivation for a grant matters because it determines how the grant should be structured to maximize welfare. At the heart of this issue is the extent to which grants from higher levels of government replace, or crowd out, lower-level government spending. For example, if the goal is simply to redistribute income, a lump sum grant would yield the largest welfare gain to local citizens. Such a grant, however, could crowd out a substantial degree of funds that local budget-setters would have committed in the absence of external support. Thus, if the impetus for a grant is to correct the under-provision of a public good or to elicit spillovers, the grant should be designed to minimize crowd-out and promote stickiness. In this case, crowding out is undesirable and may defeat the objectives of the grant program.====Intergovernmental grants typically crowd out some degree of recipient spending no matter how grant funds are earmarked, which is consistent with theoretical expectations outlined by Bradford and Oates (1971). For example, Lutz (2010) examines the fiscal consequences of New Hampshire’s 1999 school finance reform and shows that the tax burden of local residents falls by 90 cents per grant dollar. Lutz attributes this finding to the context surrounding the reform, including the state’s direct democracy that allows for reflection of median voter preferences, perfect information on the part of the voters regarding the reform, fiscal autonomy of the state, and fungibility of the grants. Crowding out is rarely perfect in settings that have been studied: most of the literature on intergovernmental grants shows that some share of grant proceeds translates into higher spending, a result dubbed the “flypaper effect” (Hines and Thaler, 1995). The extent of crowd out has been studied for a number of funding sources and funding intentions, including matched Title I education grants (Gordon, 2004, Cascio, Gordon, Reber, 2013), health care (Baicker and Staiger, 2005), highway funding (Knight, 2002), and law enforcement (Baicker, Jacobson, 2007, Evans, Owens, 2007). A related literature describes agency or grant features that make income equivalence unlikely, usually highlighting institutional features that differ from the conditions considered by Bradford and Oates (1971). See, for example, Filimon et al. (1982), Strumpf (1998), Payne (2009), Brooks et al. (2011), Glaeser (2013).====While much is known about the effect of intergovernmental funding transfers on recipient spending, the literature is much quieter, to date, on the effect of intergovernmental grants in-kind. There are numerous examples of in-kind transfers from the public sector directly to individuals, such as food assistance, health care, and housing vouchers (Tabor, 2002, Currie, Gahvari, 2008). Such transfers have been shown to raise targeted consumption (i.e., supplement would-be spending in target areas) but perhaps not to the same extent as cash (Cunha, 2014) and not without some substitution between private purchases and government provision (Gruber and Simon, 2008). In a related vein of research, Carruthers and Wanamaker (2013) detect an incomplete flypaper effect arising from a pre-War school building campaign in the segregated South, which amounted to a series of large capital transfers from private philanthropies to public school districts. The question of whether intergovernmental in-kind transfers crowd out local government spending, however, is open and unstudied. Examples of in-kind transfers from one level of government to another include the Morrill Act establishing land-grant universities, emergency response equipment provided to local governments following natural disasters, and the Department of Defense 1033 program considered here.====We contribute to our understanding of the public finance implications of external grants by exploring local effects of the federal 1033 program, which provides surplus military gear and vehicles to local governments. This application is the first to our knowledge that investigates the fiscal impacts of intergovernmental grants taking the form of goods rather than income. Since 1997, Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act has allowed for the transfer of surplus or decommissioned U.S. military equipment to local law enforcement agencies at a nominal price of zero. Decommissioned capital initially used to provide national defense is re-purposed for the provision of public safety. From 1997 through 2014, the Department of Defense transferred over $5.2 billion dollars in equipment to local law enforcement agencies, making it the largest federal-to-local grant of capital goods of which we are aware.====The 1033 program offers a unique context in which to examine the effects of intergovernmental grants. Several aspects of this setting suggest that local fiscal responses to these grants may differ substantively from monetary grants of any type. First, transfers through the 1033 program are not intended to modify local spending or preferences, or to transfer resources from rich to poor. Items received through the 1033 program are physical goods and are thus less fungible than cash. They cannot be sold or transferred to other local governments. Crowding out is still possible, of course, and could manifest as intra-agency substitution within or across functions related to 1033 equipment (e.g., the department may choose to forgo the purchase of additional uniform pants because they have received tactical pants through the 1033 program). This is most likely to arise for in-kind goods that have close substitutes within the local government’s public safety budget. Additionally, decisions to acquire items through the 1033 program are made solely by police chiefs, typically without local institutional oversight, public input, or even a signature from a city or county government official. The preferences of law enforcement executives are thus pivotal and may or may not reflect those of other bureaucrats or the voting populace. As a result, the median voter is less relevant to the acquisition of goods. The opacity of the process implies that city or county officials with presumptive budgetary authority may have incomplete information about the amount of equipment that police chiefs acquire through the 1033 program. These features of the 1033 program are the inverse of the New Hampshire school finance reform that resulted in almost complete crowd out (Lutz, 2010). Accordingly, we expect that 1033 transfers will result in substantively less crowding out.====To empirically evaluate the relationship between 1033 program receipts and local public spending on police protection, we form a county-year panel data set comprised of county expenditure accounts from the Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances matched to the value of 1033 equipment transfers from the Defense Logistics Agency received by county government law enforcement agencies, usually sheriff’s offices. Exploiting within-county intertemporal variation in 1033 acquisitions over time, we find that the value of 1033 receipts has no significant effect on local spending (i.e., a complete flypaper effect with no crowding out and no crowding in). For completeness, we estimate the relationship between 1033 receipts and local spending using both level-level and a log-log specifications. While the level-level specification is best suited for assessing the quantitative magnitude of crowding out (or crowding in), highly skewed distributions of both 1033 and local law enforcement spending motivate log transformations. Indeed, the log-log model provides more precise evidence on the sign of the relationship (whether there is crowding in or crowding out), but resulting estimates are elasticities and cannot be interpreted as a crowding out effect. While both specifications are therefore useful, neither one strictly dominates.====In our baseline specification, the effect of 1033 acquisitions on local police spending is not significantly different from zero. Confidence intervals imply a crowd-out effect of no larger than 32 cents per dollar received in 1033 transfers and a crowd-in effect of no more than 50 cents per dollar in transfers. In no specification do we find statistically significant evidence that receiving goods through the 1033 program reduces local police spending. This confidence interval lies well outside previous interval estimates in the flypaper literature, indicating there is much less crowding out in this context.==== The log-log results are considerably more precise, indicating a relatively precise zero. The robust lack of crowding out of intergovernmental transfers stands in sharp contrast to most related grant literature.====While grants through the 1033 program are much less likely to reflect endogenous voter preferences than other intergovernmental transfers (Knight, 2002), local police spending might be correlated with other time-varying unobserved factors (e.g., preferences of police chiefs, severity of departmental budget constraints, endogenous voter preferences, perhaps, or time-varying heterogeneity in law enforcement leadership). To address concerns about omitted variables driving both police budgets and 1033 receipts, we implement an instrumental variables specification that exploits exogenous variation in transaction costs faced by departments when acquiring 1033 items, similar to Harris et al. (2017).==== Instrumental variables estimates are less precise, but estimated coefficients for the effect of 1033 receipts on local police expenditures are positive, nearly significant, and more consistent with crowding in rather than crowding out.====Within the limitations of our data, we examine the possibility that null results mask heterogeneous effects by county type or equipment. Acquiring items through the 1033 program may raise spending (i.e., crowd in additional resources) if the items in question are not regular purchases and require complementary inputs. Of the various types of equipment considered, vehicles are the largest and most likely to fit this description. A tactical truck, for example, may require a new storage facility, specialized training, and unforeseen maintenance. To examine this possibility, we divide 1033 receipts into vehicle and non-vehicle items. Estimated coefficients on 1033 receipts favor crowding in for both categories of goods, although our instruments do not perform as well when confined to non-vehicle acquisitions. Additionally, we might expect the effects of 1033 receipts on local police spending to vary by the fiscal or social conservatism of an area. To evaluate this possibility, we divide the county panel according to political leanings in the 2008 presidential election. We find that democratic counties exhibit greater evidence of crowding in, although that may be because Democrat counties tend to be larger urban counties with greater flexibility in budgets to accommodate relatively small ad hoc requests from law enforcement.====The absence of crowding out is likely attributable to the design of the 1033 program rather than special features of law enforcement. Evans and Owens (2007) and Baicker and Jacobson (2007) examine intergovernmental financial transfers to law enforcement and find significant but partial crowding out, in accord with the body of research on intergovernmental grants. The 1033 program transfers capital goods, often large and rarely purchased by agencies on their own, with decision makers positioned at the end-user department rather than higher levels or inter-departmental levels of local authority. On the surface, the absence of a significant crowd-out (or crowd-in) effect of 1033 transfers on local spending can be viewed as a positive outcome, given that the program is not designed to replace or amplify local spending. More importantly, the program-specific circumstances offer lessons for how intergovernmental transfers could be designed to minimize crowd out. In cases where higher levels of government wish to increase overall local spending, policy makers might look to the structure of the 1033 program for guidance.",Do in-kind grants stick?

To guide my analysis, I develop a theoretical model that yields two implications. First, firms in larger markets organize into a greater number of layers. Second, because they have more layers, firms in larger markets are more productive.

The findings are consistent with the model. I also observe that 8.8% to 22.4% of the log productivity gains from denser areas arise from differences in the organization of firms. A separate analysis shows that results are similar across firms operating in the ====.","Ever since Smith (1776) and Marshall (1890), economists have known that there are productivity advantages to larger cities, and an extensive body of work in the economic literature has been devoted to understanding the source of these advantages (see Rosenthal, Strange, 2004, Duranton, Puga, 2004, Combes, Gobillon, 2015 for reviews of the literature). While many explanations have been proposed, comparatively little attention has been devoted to the internal organization of firms. Yet, in reality, firms are production hierarchies: they organize their labor into layers of different sizes with the aim of assigning different responsibilities to different workers within the firm. Such decisions are important as they have an effect on the productivity of firms.====This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating how the internal organization of firms varies with the size of local markets. To guide my analysis, I first develop a theoretical model that allows the size of local markets to affect the hierarchical structure of firms. Using administrative data, I then examine the model’s implications across French employment areas and the following service industries: Clothing and Shoe Retail, Traditional Restaurants, and Hair and Beauty Salons. Although these industries account for a small portion of the economic activity of areas, they are consistent with the model’s underlying assumptions. In my empirical analysis, I find that firms in denser areas organize into a greater number of layers. A firm operating in an area with a 100% higher density is 2.8% less likely to operate with only one layer in its organization, 2.0% more likely to have three layers, and 0.5% more likely to be a four-layer firm. I also find that firms with a greater number of layers are on average more productive. Finally, I find that differences in the number of layers across firms account for a meaningful share of the productivity gains from operating in denser areas. For instance, with firm productivity measured as value-added per worker, organization accounts for roughly 22.4% of the log productivity gains from operating in denser areas. A separate empirical analysis shows that results are similar across firms operating in the manufacturing sector.====The theoretical model combines the knowledge-based management hierarchy framework of Garicano (2000) and Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) with the monopolistically competitive framework of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008). Production is modeled as in Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) and requires labor to be combined with knowledge. Firms are production hierarchies and organize workers into layers of different sizes. Production workers always form the firm’s lowest layer, whereas managers occupy all the other layers. The number of layers in a firm is also determined in the model. Different organizational structures are associated with different menus of costs and, as demonstrated by Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012), the decision to add a layer is similar to a tradeoff between fixed and variable costs. An extra layer increases costs because workers are compensated for the knowledge they acquire and the time they devote to the firm. Above a certain scale, however, an additional layer allows firms to use workers’ knowledge more efficiently, lowering average costs. Thus, when a firm adds a layer, it is in a sense increasing its fixed costs and lowering its variable costs. Ultimately, a firm’s number of layers is determined by its profit maximizing output, which depends on the demand for its product and the degree of competition between firms.====To highlight how firm organization varies with the size of local markets, I embed this structure into an economy in which agents have quasi-linear preferences, and firms have heterogeneous product demand. Differences in the size of markets generate differences in the level of competition between firms. Larger markets increase the competition between firms and lower markups, which in turn forces firms with low product demand to exit the market, and the remaining firms to restructure their organization. As a consequence of these two effects, the cumulative distribution of firm organization in larger markets first-order stochastically dominates the distribution of smaller markets.====My model also implies that differences in organization bring about differences in the productivity of firms. Firms with a greater number of layers manage the knowledge of workers with greater efficiency and are consequently able to reduce average costs. Thus, the theoretical model implies that in larger markets, firms are more productive because they organize into a greater number of hierarchical layers. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to document this new channel through which the size of local markets affects the productivity of firms.====Employing high quality French administrative data, I examine the implications of the model. The primary data sources are the Déclarations Annuelles des Données Sociales (DADS) and the Fichier Complet Unifié de Suse (FICUS). From the DADS, I classify firms into one-layer, two-layer, three-layer, and four-layer firms, employing the method of Caliendo et al. (2015b). Using both sources, I calculate different estimates of firm productivity, including value-added per worker and several estimates of total factor productivity. The data also contain a wealth of information on the characteristics of firms and the demographic composition of local areas.====My analysis follows Ciccone and Hall (1996) and measures the size of markets using the population density of employment areas. Since the model makes specific assumptions on the structure of competition between firms, it directly applies only to non-tradeable monopostically competitive industries. In order to precisely investigate its implications, the main part of the analysis focuses on industries that satisfy these conditions: Clothing and Shoe Retail, Traditional Restaurants, and Hair and Beauty Salons. I also take into account several empirical concerns. First, consumer demand and the cost of hiring workers may vary with the density of the area, affecting the level of competition and firm organization. Second, it is likely that firms with a greater number of layers attract more workers to an area, or that local shocks simultaneously determine the size of areas and the outcomes of firms. Such issues could confound estimates of the relationship between density and the different outcomes of firms. To deal with these issues, I also control for the local characteristics of areas and rely on an instrumental variable estimation, using historical data from as far back as 1831.====A main prediction of the model is that the distribution of firm organization in high density areas first-order stochastically dominates the distribution of low density areas. The findings from the Mann–Whitney stochastic dominance test and the regression results confirm this prediction. Consistent with the model, I also find that firms with a greater number of layers are on average more productive. Finally, the main conclusion of my analysis is that differences in organization are economically significant. From the various measures of firm productivity, I find that between 8.8% and 22.4% of the log productivity gains from operating in denser areas arise from differences in firm organization. While the model directly applies to specific market structures, a separate analysis also investigates whether results are similar in the manufacturing sector, and reveals that my findings are robust to other industries and that differences in firm organization contribute a similar amount to the productivity gains from denser areas.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section 3 presents the theoretical model and its main implications. Section 4 introduces the data, and Section 5 empirically examines the main implications of the model.

Under the first regime, with all the three taxes available, the first-best allocation is achievable only when the property tax is unused.

The property tax is commonly defined as an ad valorem tax on the value of the property. This paper explores the optimal spatial structure of the property tax in a monocentric city with transportation congestion.====In many countries, the property tax comprises a large proportion of local tax revenue. In some, including Canada and the UK, its share of local tax revenue is almost 100 percent as reflected in Table 1. The table shows the property tax as a percentage of local tax revenue and as a percentage of the total local (government) revenue for some countries. There is a large difference between the percentages for local tax revenue and those for total local government revenue. The difference is mainly transfers from higher levels of governments. Still, property tax revenue is important for financing local government expenditure. Indeed, in France and Israel, more than 29% of local government revenues come from property taxes.====In most countries, the property tax rate is formally applied uniformly across locations. The simplicity of this uniformity is regarded as an important practical advantage and is even justified on theoretical grounds====. In many countries, including Chile, France, the UK, and Sweden, however, the property tax ratio is officially adjusted according to building characteristics such as age, purpose of use, and tenure, as well as the social characteristics of the home owner, such as disability, seniority, etc. The tax rate on residential buildings in Israel, which is called “Arnona”, varies across locations,==== and the property tax which used to be levied in the UK, called “Rates”, varied according to location. In the US, the effective tax rate may deviate from its formal uniform structure due to the assessment and calculation of the tax procedures====. In addition, a metropolitan area may include several independent tax jurisdictions such that the tax rate may vary spatially.====This paper explores the optimal spatial structure of the property tax in a monocentric city with unpriced transportation congestion. To highlight the effects of other taxes on the property tax, we discuss three regimes with different combinations of a head tax, congestion tolls, and the property tax. The tax composition is optimally determined to finance a predetermined expenditure. In the first regime, the three taxes are available. In the second regime, only a head tax and the property tax are available. This regime has already been partly explored by Pines and Kono (2012). In the third regime, which is the core of this paper, neither a head tax nor a perfect congestion toll is available, whereas the property tax is.====Under the first regime, optimal congestion toll (a genuine Pigovian tax) together with head taxes and subsidies can be applied, such that the first-best allocation is achievable====. Then, using the property tax is not only redundant, but also harmful. However, in order to implement congestion tolling optimally, a spatially differentiated congestion toll is required, which reflects the congestion external cost. Estimating this external cost requires monitoring the volume of traffic, the traffic velocity, as well as identifying the cars. Gathering the information and collecting the toll is generally considered to be impractical====. Indeed, such a first-best tolling is not implemented even approximately in real-world practice (Rouwendal and Verhoef, 2006). Instead, several cities implement substitutes to congestion tolling in the form of only cordon (or area) pricing. In such feasible practices, the market population distribution is adjusted only according to the ==== cordon line. This toll pricing is ineffective to adjust optimally the city-wide spatial population density. Indeed, Kono and Kawaguchi (2017) demonstrate that adding land use regulation to a single cordon pricing increases the welfare.====Given transportation congestion, a spatially-variable property tax, which can adjust the spatial population density, might serve as a better substitute for or as a supplement to incomplete congestion pricing in the form of a ==== cordon line. Both the second and the third regimes discussed in the present paper are directly characterized by unpriced transportation congestion. In both, the optimal property tax are then structured to provide a partial, though not perfect, substitute to tolling.====In the second regime, the property tax is exclusively designed to serve as a substitute to tolling, whereas financing the predetermined public expenditure with the property tax is incidental, since a head tax is available. Yet, it is possible that the property tax revenue exceeds the predetermined public expenditure, such that the difference is redistributed to the population as head subsidies. The tax rate in the second regime is determined such that the marginal excess burden of the property tax is equal to the marginal social cost of unpriced transportation congestion. To that end, the tax rate is negative close to the city center and positive close to the city boundary.====In the third regime, the core of the paper, optimal property tax rate is the single instrument for both ameliorating the distortion of the unpriced transportation congestion and financing the predetermined public expenditure. The property tax rate is, then, a combination of two terms. The first term is a solution of Atkinson and Stiglitz (2015, formula 15–23, page 391), (A–S, hereafter) for what they defined as a generalized Ramsey (1927) problem. The determinants of this solution are both the demand and supply elasticities, as well as the excess burden of the property tax. The second term is a substitute, albeit an imperfect substitute, to tolling, as in the second regime. In all three regimes, spatial efficiency (according to one of the definitions of Arnott (1979b)) is obtained (see Appendix A4).====The following is the plan of the paper. Section 2 sets up a model. Sections 3, 4, and 5 present the first, the second, and the third regimes, respectively. Section 5 includes numerical simulations, demonstrating our theoretical results for the third regime. Section 6 concludes our paper, suggesting the application of a spatially variable property tax and relevant extension of the present study.

I find the average author experiences productivity gains of 11.94% per annum when residing in London, the only major literary cluster – a gain not associated with living in any of the minor literary clusters. I find evidence of negative selection with respect to productivity, indicating the results are not driven by the self-selection of highly productive authors to London. I find heterogeneity of returns to living in London by birth cohort and Impact Index quartile (a measure of author quality) and that the cohorts who receive the greatest gains from locating in London are those for which there is the strongest evidence of negative selection with respect to productivity.","The potential for gains from agglomeration of industry is evident for industries with traditional modes of production. However, less is known empirically about these agglomeration effects for industries with few capital requirements and no apparent need to cluster geographically, such as literary production. Unlike a factory or science laboratory, writing does not require a centralised location of production. There are few capital requirements for the writing of literature, and the printing process does not require the author to be present. Authors are able to send drafts and conduct most business with a publisher or literary agent through the post or, in more recent years, via email. The data also suggests authors are highly mobile. Given these unique characteristics, do authors tend to cluster geographically at all? If so, are there gains in productivity associated with the agglomeration of literary activity?====In general, the geographic concentration of industry occurs because firms benefit from economies of scale via increased input-output linkages, labour market pooling, and technology spillovers (Krugman, 1991, Duranton, Puga, 2004, Combes, Gobillon, 2015). As Alfred Marshall explained:====In recent years, gains from agglomeration have been observed across a range of creative and innovative activities. Perhaps the most prevalent method of studying the gains from geographic proximity of creative and innovative activity is by “following the paper trail” in analysing the spatial clustering of patent registrations from R&D by private firms and universities.==== As Audretsch and Feldman (2004) note, “the basic results agree: Patent citations are highly localized, indicating that location and proximity clearly matter in exploiting knowledge spillovers.”====Another set of literature focuses on academic research. Waldinger (2012a) finds the breakdown of research clusters (through the dismissal of Jewish scientists in Nazi Germany) results in significant decreases in departmental productivity. Waldinger, 2012, Waldinger, 2010 find that higher cluster density and higher quality of peers within the cluster both increase the productivity of researchers and have a positive effect on the outcomes of the Ph.D. students within their department.====Another body of literature looks at the agglomeration of cultural production. Borowiecki (2013) finds that the clustering of classical music composers has a positive and significant impact on composer productivity. Borowiecki (2012) and Borowiecki and O’Hagan (2013) find the outward migration of composers during periods of war significantly reduces a country’s long-term creative potential. Hellmanzik (2010) finds that the artwork of prominent visual artists is valued higher when produced in a creative cluster. Giorcelli and Moser (2015) find that copyrights lead to an increase in both the number of Italian operas and the number of high-quality Italian operas, and they find that cities with pre-existing industry-related infrastructure received greater gains.====However, these industries have capital requirements that motivate agglomeration. The critical question in this context is thus: is literary production different? With the ability to submit writings by post, where would authors choose to live and work? Is the average author like the Brontë sisters who are often styled as solitary geniuses – or more like the Lost Generation of Paris in the 1920s, a dense network of artists, musicians, writers, and friends? How might the Marshallian agglomeration mechanisms operate in the context of literary production, if at all?====In order to answer these questions, I determine the cities in which literary activity clusters, and I empirically estimate the returns to literary agglomeration. Specifically, I utilise a unique, purpose-built dataset with information on the birth location and lifetime migration, productivity in terms of number of publications, and demographic characteristics of 370 authors in the UK and Ireland since 1700. I begin by discussing the data collection methodology. I then analyse the patterns of migration and clustering (i.e. geographic co-location) of authors, and I construct age-productivity profiles to determine the productivity gains (if any) associated with living in a literary cluster.====I find that London emerges as the only major literary cluster, with over 50% of authors locating in London in a given year during the periods with the greatest concentration of authors. In comparison, less than 20% of the UK population resided in Greater London in any given Census year. I then estimate the ”London effect” utilising individual fixed effects to control for spatial sorting by skill level, and the within estimator reveals the average author annual productivity is 11.94% per annum higher when the author resides in London. Similar agglomeration gains are not observed for the minor literary clusters. I find evidence of negative selection with respect to productivity, indicating the results are not driven by the self-selection of highly productive authors to London. I find heterogeneity of returns to living in London by birth cohort and Impact Index quartile (a measure of author quality), and I find that the cohorts who receive the greatest gains from locating in London are those for which there is the strongest evidence of negative selection with respect to productivity (authors born in the 18th century and authors ranking in the top two quartiles of the Impact Index).====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, I discuss the mechanisms responsible for innovative activity (using the Duranton and Puga, 2004, taxonomy) and how these might be realised in the context of literary production. Next, I discuss the data collection methodology and descriptive statistics in Section 3. Section 4 outlines the identification strategy, and results are presented in Section 5.

The data also paint a detailed picture of the people living in HOA neighborhoods, who are on average more affluent and racially segregated than those living in other nearby neighborhoods.","Most single-family houses constructed in the United States in recent years are part of a ==== (“CID”), governed by a ==== (“HOA”). While rare until the 1960s, HOAs have come to house a fifth of Americans, a proliferation that Guberman (2004) called “one of the most significant privatizations of local government functions in history.” HOAs are not as prevalent outside the U.S., but comparable privately governed communities now exist in a number of countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and China (McKenzie, 2011, Glasze, Webster, Frantz, 2006, Wang, 2014). Popular and academic opinions are divided over whether homeowners actually like to live in HOAs. Some contend that HOAs represent a sensible market solution to local public goods problems (Foldvary, 1994, Barton, Silverman, 1994, Nelson, 2005), while others see HOAs as a sort of unregulated hostage crisis with unwitting homeowners harassed by busybody neighbors (McKenzie, 1994, Lucas, 2013, Benson, DeBat, 2014).====Economists typically assess residents’ opinions about the value of local amenities or disamenities, such as school quality, air quality, property tax levels, or the presence of an HOA, by examining house prices. If the presence or quality of one of these features raises the price of a house, it indicates that the marginal buyer values that feature, other characteristics of the house being held constant. Households might be willing to pay more to live in a community with an HOA because HOAs provide tailored amenities and can enforce another layer of zoning, use restrictions, and minimum quality maintenance on top of that which local governments provide.==== To the extent that HOAs screen on household attributes or prohibit activities more commonly undertaken by individuals in certain groups, they could also be used as a tool for exclusion and achieving relative homogeneity of residents within a local area. However, not only are HOA residents obliged to pay regular dues, but they also must forsake some degree of personal control over their property. Whether the perceived benefits of living in a community with an HOA outweigh these costs will determine whether the presence of an HOA will tend to increase or decrease house prices.====This paper presents the first ever (nearly) national estimate of how HOAs affect single-family house prices, using public data curated by Zillow, Inc.==== The data include prices, HOA membership indicators, and other building characteristics for 34 million housing transactions, observed for 44 U.S. states over 35 years.==== Using a methodology that could be useful in a range of housing market applications, we derive HOA membership indicators from “planned unit development” and “condominium” riders described in Zillow’s collection of public mortgage records. The size of the sample allows us to estimate HOA premiums for specific locations, which can be usefully compared to each other since they are calculated using consistent data elements and methodology. Market-specific estimates also allow us to explore which local factors influence the value of living in an HOA. Our estimation approach is based on hedonic theory à la Rosen (1974). Our baseline estimates of the HOA premium control for a rich set of housing unit characteristics and are identified off variation in HOA status among homes in close proximity. We also consider a flexible, semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) specification, which is common in the hedonic literature but has not yet been applied to HOAs. In another first for this literature, we also characterize HOA fees based on data we collected from Redfin.com, an online real estate listing site that serves as a complementary data source.====The paper’s overarching conclusion is that single-family houses with an HOA generally sell at a premium, but with substantial local variation. On average, buyers pay at least 4%, or $13,500, extra for a house that is subject to an HOA. This is near the middle of the range of estimates from the existing literature on HOAs, which has generally focused on a single state or city at a time because data on these associations has been scarce. Assuming our rich set of controls limits the scope for unobservable differences between HOA and non-HOA homes to influence prices (an assumption we test in the data), this price premium implies that each dollar paid to an HOA in dues buys about $1.19 worth of benefits.====Additionally, we find that the HOA price premium varies by location. Southern core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) tend to have higher HOA premiums, while New York, CBSAs in the Rust Belt, and CBSAs on the West Coast exhibit lower premiums. Relating HOA premiums to local regulatory environments, historical and demographic features, and social attitudes sheds light on what drives homeowners’ willingness to pay for HOAs. In particular, HOA price premiums correlate with a CBSA’s degree of land use regulation and expenditures on public goods in a way that suggests that HOAs serve as a valuable substitute for local government, particularly with respect to zoning regulations and the provision of law enforcement and other highly localized public goods. Further, we find evidence of heterogeneity in HOA premiums by a CBSA’s level of economic inequality, attitudes toward racial integration, historical demographic composition, and several other characteristics.====Along with price premiums, the data we use for this paper paint an unprecedentedly detailed picture of where and when HOAs were established, what houses in HOAs look like, and who lives in HOA-regulated communities. HOA membership is most common where land was developed recently. Accordingly, HOA houses tend to be newer and slightly bigger. HOA neighborhoods are also more racially homogeneous than nearby non-HOA neighborhoods.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains in more detail what an HOA is, provides reasons why HOAs are an important institution to study, and reviews the previous literature on HOAs. Section 3 presents the local government real estate records we use and explains our methodology for identifying HOAs. Section 4 depicts the people, places, and structures found in HOAs. Section 5 uses hedonic regression to evaluate whether and how HOAs affect the value of single-family homes contained in them.

The key features of both indices are a) their ability to control for unobserved heterogeneity exploiting ==== listings, b) their use of censored durations (listings that are expired and/or withdrawn from the market), and c) their computational simplicity. The first index computes proportional displacements in the home sale hazard rate. The second estimates the relative change in median marketing time. The indices are computed using about 1.8 million listings in 15 US urban areas. Results suggest that it is important to account for both censoring and unobserved heterogeneity in measuring housing market liquidity.","The housing market clears in two dimensions: price and marketing time. Information asymmetries, transaction costs, costly matching between sellers of differentiated products and buyers with heterogenous tastes, and optimal buyers’ and sellers’ strategies determine both the sale price of a housing unit as well as its “time on the market” (TOM), the time it takes until it is sold.==== To assess housing market conditions it seems important to track the evolution of both of these dimensions.====The literature has made significant progress developing alternative approaches to measuring real estate prices. Construction of home price indices include rigorous methods that use hedonic regressions, matching techniques, and repeat sales, among others. Several studies have analyzed and compared the properties of alternative price indices==== and, perhaps due to its ability to control for unobserved housing heterogeneity, the classical approach to constructing home price indices in the U.S. focuses on ==== sales (Bailey, Muth, Nourse, 1963, Case, Shiller, 1987).==== Surprisingly, specification and estimation of housing liquidity indices have received much less attention. It is clear that TOM can measure housing liquidity risk (Lippman, McCall, 1986, Lin, Vandell, 2007), but very little is known about the properties of potential indices that track TOM’s evolution.==== This is probably the reason why there are no official indices that measure how TOM changes over time.====Given the prevalent approach to measuring prices using repeat sales, developing methods to measure the evolution of TOM while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity (i.e., by exploiting repeat sales) seems a first order issue. However, Carrillo and Pope (2012) show that expired and withdrawn listings (i.e., censored durations) are a common feature of real estate markets and that censoring drastically changes with market conditions: it remains low during housing booms and peaks during busts. Hence, any attempt to measure the distribution and evolution of TOM should explicitly take censoring into account. Measuring the evolution of TOM while accounting both for unobserved heterogenity and censored durations is not a trivial task and is the main objective and contribution of this paper. To track how TOM evolves over time we develop new indices that a) control for unobserved heterogeneity by exploiting ==== listings and therefore can be directly compared with conventional and widely available repeat home price indices, b) account for censored durations, and c) are computationally straightforward. The paper brings a methodological innovation that has the potential to be used in a number of practical applications.====The lack of official measures of TOM (and housing liquidity) is probably not due to data constraints. In the U.S. and in many other developed countries, the marketing of real estate properties is centralized in a multiple listing system where sellers list properties along with asking prices. This system typically records the date when a property is listed and the date when it is sold. This information allows one to compute the number of days that any home stays on the market. In fact, many real estate associations in the U.S. provide ==== statistics such as median or mean TOM. However, these statistics fail to account for two important features – censoring of TOM due to the expiration or delisting of homes, and unobserved home heterogeneity. If all properties that were listed were to find a buyer (i.e., if there were no censored observations), the same conventional approach used to compute repeat sale price indices could be used to estimate a TOM index that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity.==== Expired and withdrawn listings, however, are common in all markets we study. For instance, in a suburb of Washington DC (Fairfax County, VA) as many as 60 percent of listings expired and/or were withdrawn during the peak of the financial crisis. Similar patterns are found in San Diego, Las Vegas, Miami and 11 other CBSAs in the U.S. that we analyze.==== Hence, as it was the case in Carrillo and Pope (2012)’s application, any attempt to measure the evolution of TOM in our sample should account for censored durations. However, when some durations are censored, unobserved home heterogeneity cannot be differenced out using the classical repeat sales method.====We propose two models that can be used to correct for unobserved heterogeneity using ==== listings while, at the same time, accounting for censored durations. The first index, the “repeat proportional hazard index” (RPHI), is based on a proportional hazard specification and applies an estimator developed by Ridder and Tunali (1989) to compute proportional displacements in the home sale hazard rate. The second index, the “repeat median TOM index” (RMTI), is based on a novel procedure that accounts for censoring and unobserved heterogeneity in an accelerated failure time model of TOM; it estimates relative changes in (quality adjusted) median TOM over time. For both indices the main intuition is straightforward. Just as it is the case with repeat sales home price indices (Bailey et al., 1963), one can use the TOM of properties that have been on the market in more than one period to “difference out” the unobserved heterogeneity. These indices are based on two differencing strategies that adapt the conventional repeat sales method to account for the presence of random censoring.====We compute the RPHI and RMTI indices for TOM in each of the 15 CBSAs we study. We emphasize that our methods are computationally straightforward and can be easily implemented even with millions of observations. Results show that housing liquidity is subject to substantial variation over time. More importantly, we provide strong evidence that controlling for unobserved heterogeneity (i.e. using repeat listings) significantly affects the estimates of changes over time in TOM.====Finally, we use our novel TOM indices to reassess three previous empirical findings in the literature on housing liquidity. First, consistent with the findings of Diaz and Jerez (2013), we find a high within-market correlation between our TOM indices and sales volumes. Second, we report stark seasonality patterns in our indices that are similar in spirit to those reported by Ngai and Tenreyro (2014). Third, as documented by Genesove and Han (2012), we illustrate a close relationship between TOM and market fundamentals – income, population, unemployment, and interest rates. In each case, we find important differences with results obtained using a conventional measure of TOM, though generally the results are qualitatively the same. We expect that the TOM indices developed in this paper will be useful in many other applications.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section discusses the relationship between our work and the econometrics literature. Section 3 describes the data and computed descriptive statistics paying particular attention to censored observations. In Section 4 we develop our two novel TOM indices.

Then we build and estimate an equilibrium model to study the influence of geography on the skill wage premium, and to study the effects of trade and productivity shocks on welfare and inequality.====Using American census data, we show that the skill wage premium tends to be smaller in more geographically isolated cities. This result holds across a variety of specifications and weighting strategies. More specifically, the closer a city is to the ocean and the nearer it is to other cities, the larger the difference between the wages of college-educated and high-school-educated workers tends to be.==== For example, Minneapolis is around one standard deviation more isolated than Miami, and has skill wage premia around two standard deviations lower than Miami. In order to explain this correlation together with previously documented facts on population and wages, we develop an estimable equilibrium model of domestic trade and inequality.====While our research speaks to several literatures, our primary contribution is in developing an estimable equilibrium model of spatial wage inequality in which ====. Following and contributing to the popular debate on inequality, several authors have expanded our understanding of wage and welfare inequality in American data (Baum-Snow, Pavan, 2013, Combes, Duranton, Gobillon, Roux, 2012, Moretti, 2013, Diamond, 2015, Farrokhi, 2018). As a shorthand, we refer to these papers as the spatial inequality literature. To date, the spatial inequality literature has abstracted from geography. Either cities are unable to trade with each other, or able to trade with each other costlessly. In both of these extremes, the geographic location of a city relative to other cities is irrelevant, so questions about the interaction of geography with inequality cannot be addressed. By including costly trade between cities in a model of mobile heterogeneous labor, we can measure the contribution of geography to inequality.====In order to solve an equilibrium model of inequality, we use tools recently introduced to the economic geography literature by Allen and Arkolakis (2014). We follow a growing body of literature estimating structural economic geography models to evaluate the effects of economic policy on migration and welfare (Bartelme, 2018, Desmet, Nagy, Rossi-Hansberg, 2016, Allen, Arkolakis, Li, 2016). The economic geography literature as a whole has typically focused on welfare at the aggregate (Krugman, 1991, Fujita, Krugman, Venables, 2001, Fajgelbaum, Morales, Suárez Serrato, Zidar, 2018, Monte, Redding, Rossi-Hansberg, 2018).==== We complement this literature by studying the effects of policy not only on aggregate welfare but also on welfare inequality.====Our modeling approach allows us to fully solve for counterfactual outcomes taking general equilibrium effects into account. In contrast, the spatial inequality literature has often used equilibrium models without solving for equilibrium. Recent spatial inequality contributions employ instrumental variables and equilibrium relationships to identify a handful of parameters of interest (Moretti, 2013, Baum-Snow, Freedman, Pavan, 2018). This methodology is sufficient to test alternative hypotheses about sources of inequality, but it limits a researcher’s ability to run counterfactual policy experiments. The closest paper in this recent literature to ours is Diamond (2015), who estimates a rich structural spatial inequality model based on discrete choices of workers over where to live. Diamond (2015) allows for a more flexible specification, while we adopt a more stylized model. The advantage of our stylized model is that we can fully solve our model for the equilibrium employment and wages of skill groups across cities at a wide range of counterfactual parameter values.====In our model, we have a continuum of locations. Bilateral trade costs characterize the geography of these locations. In each location, there are immobile landlords, immobile firms, and perfectly mobile workers. Workers come in two types, high-skill and low-skill, and each worker has an idiosyncratic utility from living in each location. A worker decides where to live taking prices and wages as given. A firm also takes local wages as given, and produces a tradeable good using high-skill and low-skill labor as inputs. The key difference between high and low-skill workers is that high-skill workers benefit more from agglomeration.==== In equilibrium, the welfare of marginal workers in each skill group equalizes across space.====We require a model that generates higher skill wage premia in less remote cities. We add two critical features to a quantitative economic geography model in the style of Allen and Arkolakis (2014) to deliver the required relationship. These two features are stronger agglomeration forces for high-skill workers, and heterogeneous location preferences. The intuition behind this interaction can be described in a few sentences. Consider a city near other cities, a centrally-located city. Its access to cheap tradeable goods and nearby markets make this city attractive to live in. This leads the city, all else equal, to have a relatively high population of both high and low-skill workers compared with a remote city. Due to agglomeration forces, high-skill workers are relatively more productive in the centrally-located city. If the ratio of high to low-skill wages in the centrally-located city were the same as in the remote city, firms would demand a larger ratio of high to low-skill workers in the centrally-located city. In order for the demand for high-skill labor to equal its supply, in equilibrium the high to low-skill wage ratio must be higher in the centrally-located city. Because location preferences matter, high-skill workers elsewhere do not fully arbitrage away the higher wages in the centrally-located city.====We interpret the American census data in 2000 as the equilibrium outcome of our model, and we use Core Based Statistical Areas as our cities or geographical units of observation. We estimate our model parameters using equilibrium relationships that describe labor supply and demand across these cities. In addition, we estimate costs of trading goods between cities in a similar way as in Allen and Arkolakis (2014).====We use our estimated model to perform several quantitative exercises. To be clear, our primary contribution is to clarify mechanisms that can generate the patterns of skill wage premia we observe across space. As is standard in the quantitative economic geography literature, our estimates rely on the structure of our stylized model. With that caveat, the exercises we perform help us understand the implications of the mechanisms in our model. First, we use our estimated amenities, productivities, and trade costs to decompose the variation in observed wage premia across American cities. We find that geographical position explains 16.5% of the variation in skill premia across cities. In addition, we simulate the model equilibrium when domestic trade costs change. We find that reductions in domestic trade costs benefit both types of labor, but low-skill labor gains more than high-skill labor. This result is in contrast to a number of papers that study the effects of international trade on inequality (Antràs, Garicano, Rossi-Hansberg, 2006, Hummels, Jørgensen, Munch, Xiang, 2014).==== In our exercise, better trading infrastructure tends to spread out the population in the United States so that high-skill workers lose some of their agglomeration advantage over low-skill workers. The negative effect of trade on the skill wage premium in the international context is reversed when labor is mobile in the presence of agglomeration economies in the national context.====Lastly, we simulate the equilibrium effects of the rise of Silicon Valley by implementing a counterfactual productivity shock to all cities in California such that our model generates actual changes to the share of high and low-skill population in California between 1980 to 2000. We find that this skill-biased technology shock increased the expected welfare of high-skill workers nationally by 1.3% and of low-skill workers nationally by 0.3%.",Wage inequality and the location of cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300269,May 2019,2019,Research Article,150.0

We consider 347 estimates of density elasticities of a broad range of outcomes ranging from wages, innovation, rents, various amenities, the cost of providing public services, transport- and environment-related outcomes to health and ====. More than 100 of these estimates have not been previously published and have been provided by authors on request or inferred from published results in auxiliary analyses. We contribute original estimates of density elasticities of 16 distinct outcome variables that belong to categories where the evidence base is thin, inconsistent or non-existent. Along with a critical discussion of the quality and the quantity of the evidence base we present a set of recommended elasticities. Applying them to a scenario that roughly corresponds to an average high-income city, we find that density seems to be a net-amenity that is associated with positive external welfare effects. Densification policies may be welfare enhancing, but the distributional effects may be regressive, especially if residents are immobile and housing supply is inelastic.","The degree of concentration of economic activity in urban areas is striking as they host more than 50% of the world's population (United Nations, 2014) on only an approximate 2.7% of the world's land (GRUMP 2010, Liu et al., 2014).==== There is a consensus among planners and policymakers, however, that even higher densities within cities and urban areas are desirable, at least on average (Boyko and Cooper, 2011, OECD 2012). Most countries pursue policies that implicitly or explicitly aim at promoting “compact urban form”, reflecting the concern that unregulated economic markets will fail to deliver allocations of uses and infrastructure that are efficient and equitable (IAU-IDF 2012, Holman et al., 2014). It is difficult to ascertain, however, to what extent this normative statement prevailing in the policy debate can be substantiated by evidence (Neuman, 2005).====To our knowledge, no attempt has been made to synthesise the evidence on the economic effects of density and to compare the variety of costs and benefits across a comprehensive range of outcome categories. It seems fair to state that the dominating “compact city” policy paradigm, which aims at shaping the habitat of the urban population over the decades to come, is not well-grounded in evidence. We make four contributions to address this notable gap in the literature.====Our first contribution is to provide a unique summary of the quantitative literature on the economic effects of density. Our evidence base contains 347 estimates (from 180 studies) of the effects of density on a wide range of outcomes including accessibility (job accessibility, accessibility of private and public services), various economic outcomes (productivity, innovation, value of space), various environmental outcomes (open space preservation and biodiversity, pollution reduction, energy efficiency), efficiency of public service delivery, health, safety, social equity, transport (ease of traffic flow, sustainable mode choice), and self-reported well-being.====While the evidence base is shared with a companion paper (Ahlfeldt and Pietrostefani, 2017), the results presented in the two papers are mutually exclusive. In the companion paper, we analyse the effects of a variety of compact city characteristics (including morphological features and land use mix), restricting the interpretation to qualitative results in order to explore the full evidence base. In this paper, we focus on a quantitative comparison, and, therefore, restrict the analysis to results that can be expressed as density elasticity estimates. For more than 100 cases, we conduct back-of-the-envelope calculations to convert the results into a comparable metric or obtain results that had not previously been published from the relevant authors. Borrowing techniques from meta-analytic research, we analyse within-category heterogeneity with respect to characteristics such as the methods used, the citations adjusted for years since publication, or the geographic setting of the analysis. In some instances, we make admittedly ambitious assumptions to translate results published in fields such as engineering and medical research into a format that is compatible with the conventions in economics and related disciplines.====Our second contribution is to provide original elasticity estimates where the evidence base is thin or inconsistent. We provide transparent density elasticity estimates based on a consistent econometric framework and OECD data that refer to 16 distinct outcome variables (from 10 outcome categories). For some outcomes, such as the density elasticity of preserved green space, our estimates are without precedent. We provide an estimate of the elasticity of density with respect to city size, which facilitates a better comparison of the results from studies analysing the effects of density and city size. To reconcile the evidence on the effects of density on wages, rents, and various (dis)amenities, we also provide novel estimates of the density elasticity of construction costs.====Our third contribution is to condense this broad evidence base into a set of 15 category-specific density elasticity estimates. Specific to each category, we either recommend the weighted (by adjusted citations) mean across the elasticity estimates in our evidence base, an estimate from a high-quality original research paper or one of our original estimates. Along with the recommended elasticities, we provide a critical discussion of the quality and the quantity of the evidence base, highlighting priority areas for further research. The compact presentation of a variety of density elasticity estimates in a consistent format is unique in terms of accessibility and coverage and represents a convenient source for research engaging with the quantitative interpretation of density effects.====Our fourth contribution is to monetise the economic effects of density. For each of the 15 outcome categories, we compute the per capita present value (PV, at a 5% discount rate) of the effect of a 1% increase in density for a scenario that roughly corresponds to an average metropolitan area in a developed country. For this purpose, we combine our recommended density elasticity estimates with several valuations of non-marketed goods such as time, crime and mortality risk, or pollution, among many others. The monetary equivalents allow for a novel accounting of the costs and benefits of density and how the net effect of density across a broad range of amenity and dis-amenity categories aligns with estimates of quality of life based on cost-earning differentials.====Our analysis reveals sizeable benefits and costs of density. A log-point increase in density leads to (log-point effects in parenthesis) higher wages (0.04), higher rent (0.15) and lower average vehicle mileage (0.06), but also higher pollution concentration (0.13) and lower average speed (0.12). For other outcomes, existing estimates are better interpreted as associations in the data since the causal interpretation would rest on the strong assumption that differences in density are historically determined by factors that have no contemporaneous effects on outcomes. A log-point increase in density is associated with (log-point effects in parenthesis) higher patent activity (0.21), consumption variety value (0.12), preservation of green spaces (0.28), as well as lower car use (0.05), energy consumption (0.07), crime (0.085), and costs of providing local public services (0.17). Density, however, is also associated with higher construction costs (0.55), skill wage gaps (0.035), mortality risk (0.09) as well as lower self-reported well-being (0.004).====Studies that are more frequently cited, or use more rigorous methods, find less positive density effects (in a normative sense). The estimates also become less positive over time, possibly reflecting a trend towards the application of more rigorous methods. Although more evidence would be desirable to substantiate our findings, our analysis reveals some insights into geographic heterogeneity in density elasticity estimates. For non-high-income countries, the estimated density elasticity of wages, at 0.08, is twice as large for high-income countries, on average. Mode choice is less likely to change with density, whereas the gains from density in terms of domestic energy consumption appear to be larger. Compared to other developed countries, density in the US is associated with larger skill wage gaps and higher rather than lower crime rates. Our review of the literature also suggests that the effect of density on rents may not be log-linear. Estimates of the density elasticity of rent increase by 0.063 for every increase in population density by 1000 inhabitants per square kilometre. We do not find a similar non-linearity in the estimated effects of density on wages, suggesting that convex costs lead to a bell-shaped net-agglomeration benefits curve (Henderson, 1974).====In our illustrative scenario, a 1% increase in density leads to an increase in the per capita present value (infinite horizon, 5% discount rate) of wages and rents of $280 ($190 after taxes) and $347. Summing up the monetary equivalents of all amenity and dis-amenity categories we find a clearly positive value, which is, however, not as large as the “compensating differential” (rent effect – after-tax wage effect). While density seems to be a net amenity, our admittedly imperfect accounting also suggests that part of the rent increase may be attributable to the higher cost of providing space in addition to enjoyable amenities. Policy-induced densification may lead to aggregate welfare gains. However, there may be a collateral net-cost to renters and first-time buyers.==== This effect adds to a potentially regressive distributional impact due to a widening skill wage gap.====Our analysis unifies important strands in the economics literature on the spatial organisation of economic activity. We provide an explicit comparison of the magnitude of agglomeration benefits on the production (e.g. Combes et al., 2012) and consumption side (e.g. Couture, 2016), the effects of urban form on innovation (e.g. Carlino et al., 2007), housing rent (e.g. Combes et al., 2018), quality of life (e.g. Albouy and Lue, 2015), driving distances (Duranton and Turner, 2018), road speeds (Couture et al., 2018), public spending reduction (e.g. Hortas-Rico and Sole-Olle, 2010), energy consumption (Glaeser and Kahn 2010), skill-wage gaps (Baum-Snow and Pavan, 2012) and self-reported well-being (Glaeser et al., 2016), in addition to a range of density effects on outcomes that have remained under-researched in the economics literature. Our findings also have important policy implications as they suggest that densification policies are likely efficient but not necessarily equitable.====Some words are due on the limitations of this ambitious synthesis. The fundamental challenge the literature faces is to separate the effects of density from unobserved factors that determine density. As mentioned above, a causal interpretation often requires the strong identifying assumption that contemporary density is not endogenous to factors that have direct effects on outcomes. Moreover, for individual-, firm-, and unit-based outcomes (e.g. wages, innovation, rent, wellbeing), the collected density elasticity estimates often capture composition effects. In general, the quantitative results are best suited for an evaluation of the effects of densification policies applied to individual cities (as opposed to all cities in a country) in the long run. Compared to wages and mode choice, the evidence base for the other outcomes is generally underdeveloped. While for some categories selected high-quality contributions are available, the nature of the evidence is at best preliminary for others. Significant uncertainty surrounds any quantitative interpretation in the categories urban green, income inequality, health, and well-being. We view these outcomes as priority areas for further research into the effects of density. In general, the extant evidence base consists of point estimates, so that heterogeneity in density effects across contexts and the density distribution remains a key subject for future original research and reviews.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we provide an introduction into the origins of density and some ancillary estimates that help with the interpretation of density effects. In Section 3, we lay out how the evidence base was collected and classified. Section 4 summarises the evidence by outcomes and attributes. Section 5 presents a discussion of our original density elasticity estimates. Section 6 condenses the evidence (including our original estimates) to 15 outcome-specific density elasticity estimates. Section 7 discusses the monetary equivalents of an increase in density. The final Section 8 concludes. We also provide an extensive technical Supplementary material 1 with additional results and explanations, which is essential reading for those wishing to use our quantitative results in further research (recommended elasticities and monetary equivalents).",The economic effects of density: A synthesis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300282,May 2019,2019,Research Article,151.0

The primary source of bias identified is in the weights appraisers assign to selected comparable transactions after adjusting for observable attributes. This unequal weighting results in an additional 23% of appraised values being at least equal to contract price. Appraisers were also more likely to bias appraised values for the properties associated with loan officers and real estate brokers they worked with more frequently. These findings offer insights into how appraisers confirmed ever increasing prices leading in to the housing market crash and subsequent ====.,"The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (2012) estimated the 2008 financial crisis cost the U.S. economy $5.7 trillion dollars. The run-up of housing prices in the last decade along with an associated increase in household debt resulted in a subsequent housing bust and a severe economic recession (Mian and Sufi, 2009, Mian and Sufi, 2010). A key contributing factor behind this housing price run-up was appraiser confirmation of housing prices beyond those suggested by economic fundamentals and valuation models, generally referred to as appraisal bias (Shi and Zhang, 2015, Griffin and Maturana, 2016, Kruger and Maturana, 2017; Demiroglu and James, ====). Reforms were enacted following the Great Recession in an effort to limit appraisal bias and potential financial conflicts of interests of appraisers, although exposure to risk from future crises remains unclear (Ding and Nakamura, 2016).====Home mortgage lenders are required to obtain an independent appraisal to verify the value of the property that will serve as collateral for the loan. This requirement exists because expected credit losses by the lender are directly related to the ratio of the loan's balance to collateral value (see for instance Foote et al., 2008, Kelly, 2008, Mayer et al., 2009, Bhutta et al., 2010, Elul et al., 2010, An et al., 2012). Related literatures in economics, finance, and real estate have illustrated the presence of appraisal bias associated with residential loans, which will result in borrowers having a higher incidence of default and resulting loss severity than otherwise anticipated (see Ding and Nakamura (2016) for a recent review). This literature primarily identifies appraisal bias by comparing appraised values to econometrically derived estimates, which are commonly called automated valuation models (AVM). These alternative estimates may themselves be biased due to either unobserved heterogeneity (i.e., omitted variables) or if the researcher only has access to appraisals associated with successfully originated loans (i.e., sample selection). More specifically, an appraised value below contract price may lead to either a renegotiation or failed origination resulting in a censored sample (Fout and Yao, 2016). The motivation and mechanism by which appraisers introduce bias into their estimates also remain unclear, which is important when designing future policies.====The current paper extends the literature in multiple ways using a novel data set of 6.5 million appraisals associated with loan applications conducted between 2013 and 2017. The data are novel because the inclusion of information on the 25.3 million comparable transactions used by appraisers to justify their opinion of value regardless of whether the loan was successfully originated. It also identifies the financial institution, loan officer, and real estate broker associated with the pending transaction. This level of data has not previously been available to researchers, especially at a national scale, and allows an unprecedented analysis of appraiser practices.====A primary contribution of the research is to document the importance of subjective weighting of comparable transactions selected by appraisers to justify their appraised values. Virtually all appraisers of residential property use the sales-comparison approach, which requires appraisers to first match the property subject to the appraisal with recent and comparable transactions of similar properties. Appraisers then manually adjust the price of each comparable transaction based on any unmatched attributes with the subject property, including changes in market conditions. Identification of appraisal bias arising from these first two steps is however unclear without additional information on both comparable transactions the appraiser did not select as well as a measure of the appropriate adjustments appraisers should have made for these differences.====The final step of the sales-comparison approach requires the appraiser to apply their own subjective weights to their selected comparable transactions to reach an appraised value. An equal weighting of comparable transactions after adjusting for observable differences is arguably the least biased estimator, and systematic deviations from that average can be interpreted as appraisal bias. Two main sources of appraisal bias are identified====First, appraisers were 467% more likely to use differential weighting to increase the appraised value if the average of adjusted comparable transactions was below contract price. An appraised value below contract price will threaten the loan origination and the appraiser may feel direct or indirect pressure to increase their valuation to at least that amount (Fout and Yao, 2016). Appraisers were the most likely to use differential weighting if the average was immediately below contract price (i.e., within 1% of contract price), but remained significantly more likely to increase the appraised value even when the average was more than 5% below contract price. Second, appraisers were more likely to adjust weights to justify an appraised value at least equal to contract price for the loan officers and real estate brokers associated with the pending loan application the appraiser worked with most frequently. These above results are robust to inclusion of appraiser and time fixed effects, rounding up to the nearest thousand dollars, and controlling for the proximity and similarity of comparable transactions.====These results imply that appraisal bias and the undue influence of counterparties persist even after reforms were enacted to limit such relationships following the Great Recession. This is important because regulators continue to depend on appraisals to determine acceptable exposure to credit risk for mortgage lenders in an effort to prevent future financial crises. Better understanding of the underlying mechanism and motivations behind appraisal bias can also inform the design of future policies, which are discussed in the conclusion.",The influence of contract prices and relationships on appraisal bias,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300294,May 2019,2019,Research Article,152.0

Using new geographically detailed data on highway construction that was funded bythe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, I study how road construction projects affect local employment growth. The method for allocating funds across space facilitates a plausible selection-on-observables strategy. I find that highway funding impacted construction employment at the county level: A dollar of additional Recovery Act spending on local construction increased local construction payrolls by thirty cents during the five years after the Act’s passage. The magnitude of this effect matches the national labor share of construction revenues, suggesting that targeted spending did not crowd out other local construction. These effects are most pronounced in counties with smaller populations and smaller shares of residents that commute to outside counties for work. However, when testing for ==== effects on local employment and payroll aggregates, I find effects close to zero, with very wide confidence intervals across all specifications. Although the Recovery Act was an intervention significant enough to have a sizable impact on the construction sector in counties with low mobility, these findings suggest that the local variation in highway spending was too small relative to baseline regional volatility to detect a “local multiplier” effect impacting jobs outside of construction.","During the recession following the 2008 financial crisis in the United States, some localities were much harder hit than others. This was particularly true in the construction sector: for example, Clark County, Nevada (where Las Vegas is) lost ==== as many construction jobs per resident as in Harris County, Texas (where Houston is). In the wake of the recession, many policymakers advocated for spending on public infrastructure projects as a means of putting people back to work in distressed regions; not only might these projects improve or repair vital infrastructure, but the resulting need for laborers to do work at projects sites could also be a cost-effective way to create additional construction jobs that might in turn support other new jobs in the vicinity. To this end, the stimulus measure passed in 2009—the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (known as the Recovery Act or ARRA)—authorized $27 billion in spending on road-construction projects, prioritizing those that were “shovel-ready” and could begin as soon as funding was secured. Soon after, construction sites around the country featured signs advertising that the Recovery Act was “Putting America to Work.” But were these projects really cost-effective at increasing employment in the short-run?====This paper evaluates the local labor-market impacts of stimulus-funded road-construction projects. In theory, the effects of local construction projects hinge on multiple factors. One one hand, it is possible that Recovery Act projects pulled local workers away from other jobs, dampening the net employment effect. For instance, while contractor firms reported that approximately 45,000 employees were working full-time on Recovery Act road projects during 2010 (GAO, 2011), local laborers might otherwise have been at work on different construction projects that were crowded out by Recovery Act projects. Moreover, projects in a specific locale might be constructed by firms and workers based in other locales, reducing the effect on ==== employment. On the other hand, any additional construction work in a given locale might have a “local multiplier effect” (Moretti, 2010): increased local spending by construction workers may have supported additional jobs in the broader economy. However, such an effect requires that workers spend additional income locally—if that spending goes to goods and services produced elsewhere, there may be “diffuse multiplier” effects that do not register in any one locality.====I exploit several unique features of the Recovery Act and its implementation to test how roadbuilding affects local labor markets. First, unlike typical federal road spending, the Recovery Act required centralized project-level reporting on stimulus-funded road-construction projects nationwide. The resulting data allow one to measure nationwide variation in construction spending at fine levels of geographic disaggregation. Second, the need to commit funds quickly to “shovel-ready” projects that were already planned resulted in a regional distribution of spending that had little to do with how hard the recession hit different regions. Contrary to a systematic targeting of distressed regions, I find surprisingly little evidence of any targeting based on observable employment trends. Third, the Act was largely unanticipated before the crisis at the end of 2008, and the funds it provided were supplemental to baseline spending commitments. These features motivate a simple difference-in-differences design in which I study whether locales that received relatively more Recovery Act funding experienced more favorable employment growth than those that received relatively less funding.====I first test for a “direct effect” of road spending on local construction employment. I find significant post-Recovery Act effects on counties’ construction employment, which are largest in 2010. In particular, I find that one million dollars spent in a given county increased construction employment in the same county by six job-years, implying a cost per construction job-year of about $150,000. Consistent with the identification assumptions, I find no differences in pre-period trends. For each dollar of stimulus spent in a county, construction payrolls in that county grew by 30 cents over the next five years. This magnitude corresponds nearly exactly to labor’ s share of construction revenues in national statistics, suggesting that Recovery Act projects did not crowd out other construction jobs. This same-county effect is large, given that a significant majority of vendor firms reported their contracting offices were located in different counties than where their project sites were located. When I test for effects in nearby counties that are common origins or destinations of local commuters, I find some evidence of commuting spillovers, but these estimates are highly imprecise.====However, I find no evidence of a “local multiplier” effect, in which employment expands beyond the direct increase in construction jobs. Moreover, I estimate effects on total county payroll and employment that are smaller than the effects on the construction sector, implying a general equilibrium local jobs multiplier of less than one. However, the confidence intervals around these point estimates are wide and are consistent with employment effects ranging anywhere from a loss of twenty-five jobs-years to a gain of over thirty job-years per million dollars. A small local multiplier may indicate that the general equilibrium multiplier effects stemming from increased local incomes are highly spatially diffuse. I find some evidence that counties with lower commuting penetration have larger total employment effects, but the results are imprecise. More generally, an imprecise zero estimate may simply reflect a lack of statistical power. While the Recovery Act may have had sufficiently large impacts on construction employment to detect an effect, the local variation in highway spending was likely too small relative to the variation in all other employment to detect a local multiplier. Consistent with this explanation, I find that the baseline results on construction employment are driven by smaller, more isolated counties, whereas no effect is discernible in counties that are larger or more open to commuting.","Putting America to work, where?

To deal with endogenous location choices of immigrants, these studies often use a shift-share ==== approach. This approach, however, fails to adequately account for the natural attraction of immigrants to cities with thriving economies. High-immigration cities provide more economic opportunities and thus exhibit persistently rising housing prices and rents. This paper improves upon the traditional empirical approach by explicitly controlling for initial city characteristics that lead to both increases in immigration and the evolution of rents. Results suggest that after controlling for endogenous sorting of immigrants, the positive effect of immigration on rents is attenuated. While the impact of immigrant inflows is smaller, an extension of the main results suggests the effects of immigration on rents remains larger than that of native inflows.","With average annual inflows of roughly 1 million persons over the last two decades, legal immigration has a tremendous effect on housing demand in receiving cities in the US. Since the pioneering work of Saiz (2003), many have analyzed the role of immigration on the housing market.==== Regardless of the country of analysis, researchers typically find a significant, positive short-run impact of immigration on housing prices and rents. Results from studies on the US are fairly consistent: Saiz (2007) finds an inflow of new legal immigrants equal to 1% of the total population causes an increase of around 1% for both rents and housing values, and Ottaviano and Peri (2012) find an increase in housing prices between 1.1 – 1.6%.====The general result found in the literature is hardly debatable; a one-time increase in population should have ==== positive impact on short-run housing prices, ceteris paribus==== The question, however, is whether these effects should be considered ====. The sorting of immigrants across localities and the resulting bias is well-documented in both the labor and migration literatures, and researchers have utilized a variety of methods to account for this phenomenon (Edin et al., 2003, Edin et al., 2004, Glitz, 2012). In the urban and housing literatures, studies tend to rely on shift-share estimation methods that use predicted immigration rates, based on historical settlement patterns, as an instrument for observed immigration rates. The motivation for this instrument is immigrant location choices are predictable in that the most important determinant of immigrant location choice is the share of the existing population that is foreign-born (Bartel, 1989, Bauer et al., 2005, Chiswick and Miller, 2004, Zavodny, 1999). Because this predicted rate of immigration is merely a function of historical immigrant settlement patterns and national levels of immigration, researchers suggest that the instrument is independent of city-specific shocks that directly impact rents. In other words, the identifying assumption of this approach is that while location decisions of current immigrants are endogenous to the evolution of rents today, historical migration decisions are exogenous.====This approach, however, ignores notable historic and ==== differences between high- and low-immigration cities that are important to the current evolution of rents. If shocks to the housing market are persistent over time, then the instrument is potentially invalid – the exclusion restriction would fail to hold as the instrument is correlated with current shocks through past shocks.==== In this paper, I revisit the effects of immigration on U.S. housing rents and improve upon the shift-share estimation approach by explicitly controlling for initial city characteristics that are correlated with both increased immigration and the evolution of rents. Namely, I include controls for historical economic and housing market characteristics that both attracted immigrants in the past and predispose cities to increased future growth. This empirical approach is motivated by the knowledge that certain economic conditions in cities are persistent over time. Cities that have historically attracted in-migrants (both native and foreign-born) continue to do so in the future (Blanchard and Katz, 1992, Glaeser et al., 1995). Moreover, there exist “superstar cities” that face persistent increased relative housing price growth over time (Gyourko et al., 2013). If immigrants, both past and present, are disproportionately attracted to superstar cities or cities with thriving economies, the effect identified in the existing literature is merely correlation.====To this end, this paper makes two primary contributions to the literature. First, using annual data on housing prices and immigrant inflows, I show that the short-run impact of immigration on housing rents is significantly lower once one controls for the natural attraction of immigrants to cities with thriving economies. Findings suggest that an immigrant inflow equal to 1% of the population leads to a 0.3–0.4% increase in rental prices. This result is robust to alternate definitions of the initial city characteristics, two measures of rental prices, and different sample periods. As noted above, this result is in contrast to the existing literature, which typically estimate a roughly one-to-one impact of immigration on rents. I attribute this roughly 75% reduction in the point estimate to the bias introduced by the shift-share instrumental variable. Because high-immigration cities not only provide increased economic activity today but have done so historically, past immigrant location choices and current rent growth are shown to be positively correlated with the initial economic conditions in these cities. Omission of this relationship leads to biased (upward) and inconsistent estimates as the instrument is correlated with the error term.====An analysis of longer run changes further confirm the role of immigrant location choices, specifically the proclivity to reside in areas with inelastic housing supply, in determining the effect of immigration on housing prices and rents. Because housing supply is more elastic over time, one would expect the impact of immigration to be muted in the medium- and long-run. Medium-run estimates are remarkably consistent with the short-run estimates and, again, suggest that an immigrant inflow equal to 1% of the population leads to a 0.3–0.4% increase in rental prices. Long-run estimates, however, tell a different story. When analyzing 30-year changes in rents and immigrant inflows, the results suggest an immigrant inflow equal to 1% of the total population leads to a 0.9% increase in rents; roughly twice as large as the short- and medium-run estimates. While this result runs contrary to economic theory, I show that this result is driven by the location choices of immigrants. The effect of immigration on rents is shown to be significantly higher in regions with relatively inelastic long-run housing supply (e.g. Pacific and New England Census divisions and California). Specifically, an immigrant inflow equal to 1% of the population to a Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) with inelastic long-run housing supply leads to an increase in rents of 1.2–1.6% more than CBSA's located in the rest of the US. In areas with relatively elastic long-run housing supply, the estimated effect is less precise and much smaller in magnitude (again, around 0.4%).====The question remains, however, whether the magnitude of the results herein are reasonable. To frame expectations on the anticipated effect of immigration on rents, further context is needed. In the housing literature, population growth or employment growth are often included as controls in the typical housing price determination equation. The evidence of the impact of population growth on housing prices is mixed, as studies often find insignificant and wrong-signed estimates (Malpezzi et al., 1998, Poterba, 1991). Abraham and Hendershott (1996) do find a positive and statistically significant impact of employment growth on housing, but the magnitude is much smaller – around 0.3% increase in housing prices for a 1% increase in employment. These results present an empirical puzzle that has not been addressed in the literature. Why is the effect of total population growth on housing prices and rents significantly smaller and more difficult to ascertain than the effect of immigrant inflows?====Two plausible explanations exist to explain the differences in magnitudes between the effect of immigrant inflows relative to the effect of overall population growth on housing prices and rents. One explanation is that immigrant inflows and native population growth are ==== inherently different; rather, differential effects on housing prices and rents are driven by the location choices of the two groups. One such example are differences in housing supply elasticity across locations in the US (Green et al., 2005, Saiz, 2010). The elasticity of housing supply is fundamental in determining the effect of a demand shock on housing prices. If supply is relatively elastic, an increase in housing demand would have a relatively small impact on prices, as the housing stock more easily adjusts to the population inflow. If, however, supply is relatively inelastic, an increase in housing demand should lead to increased prices and rents. As such, differences in the estimated effects could be driven by the fact that immigrants disproportionately settle in areas with relatively inelastic supply, while natives tend to settle in areas with relatively elastic supply. The data seem to support this interpretation. Of the newly-arriving immigrants who entered the US between 2000 and 2010, 94% settled in metropolitan areas, 40% settled in metropolitan areas considered “superstars” by Gyourko et al. (2013), and 67% settled in metropolitan areas with highly inelastic housing supply.==== Conversely, of natives who recently moved in the 2010 Census, 76% settled in metropolitan areas, 11% settled in superstar metropolitan areas, and 31% settled in metropolitan areas with highly inelastic housing supply.==== It is clear that immigrants are more likely to settle in large cities with relatively more inelastic housing supply. Because past studies on the effect of immigration on rents fail to adequately control for superstar status and the elasticity of housing supply, it is unsurprising that the effects estimated by those studies are larger.====While the data suggest that differences in location choices could resolve the puzzle noted above, it is possible that immigrant inflows and native population growth do have a differential impact on the housing market. It is well known that immigrants are more likely to settle in cities with larger immigrant populations, as these communities provide cultural amenities and network externalities. If the desire to reside in these high-immigrant cities is sufficiently strong, then the increased willingness to pay of newly arriving immigrants has the potential to bid up rents and housing prices in receiving cities above and beyond an equal-sized inflow of natives (Saiz, 2007). As such, whether immigrant inflows and native population inflows have a differential effect on the housing market is purely an empirical question.====Prior studies in the literature have ignored native population flows in the estimating equation and focused solely on the inflows of immigrants. Considering that both native and immigrant inflows are housing demand shifters, this empirical approach is incomplete. In an equilibrium model of the housing market, one would expect ==== immigrant and native population flows to influence the evolution of rents. As such, a second contribution of this paper is to address the relative effects of immigrant and native populations flows on housing rents. The results of the extension are two-fold. First, the main result is robust to the inclusion of native inflows into the model. Findings again suggest that immigrant inflows equal to 1% of the population leads to a 0.4% increase in rental prices. Second, even with a properly specified model that accounts for inherent differences in economic and housing market conditions among cities, immigrant inflows have a larger impact on rents relative to native population inflows. The difference in the magnitude is highly statistically significant at the 1% level. Taken together, the results suggest that differences in location choices, while important, cannot explain the entire gap in the literature.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section two presents the empirical strategy for the paper. I start by documenting the tendency for immigrants to cluster in cities with thriving economies with relatively inelastic housing supply and discuss the implications for the typical model specification used in the existing literature. Section three describes the data sources used in this analysis. A full description of each variable used can be found in the Data Appendix and summary statistics are provided in Table 2. Section four presents the main results of the paper. Section five provides empirical support for the bias introduced by the shift-share instrument without controlling for initial city characteristics and the role of housing supply. Section six provides the analysis of the effects of immigrant inflows relative to native inflows.

Using panel microdata collected between 2008 and 2014, it exploits the arbitrary eligibility rules of the policy with a fuzzy ==== to obtain reduced form estimates. There are three main findings. First, in the short-term of 2 to 4 years following relocation, the labor supply of recipient households decreases, driven mostly by a reduction of female hours. Second, the large increase in distance (km) to economic opportunities seems to be an important factor behind the decline, directly or indirectly through family shifts in earning strategies. Finally, evidence is limited regarding improvements in housing and neighborhood quality. Overall, there is no clear indication that the net welfare effect of relocation is positive.","Cities in developing countries are often characterized by spatial fragmentation due to poor transport infrastructure and low levels of public service provision. As a consequence, access to urban amenities, public goods (Brueckner and Lall, 2015), and urban labor markets (Glaeser et al., 2008, Zenou, 2009) are major determinants of households location decisions. Poor households frequently choose to live in substandard housing conditions and hostile geographical environments to be close to economic opportunities (Galiani et al., 2017). This proliferation of informal settlements have led to the development of relocation programs that directly allocate subsidized housing to eligible households through lotteries or waiting lists (Barnhardt et al., 2017). Yet, they are often located at the peripheries of cities, emphasizing the complex trade-offs poor households have to make between housing quality and access to opportunities. Because of the endogeneity between location and socioeconomic outcomes, the causal impact of these policies is not well understood. This paper exploits a rule-based public housing program to provide reduced form evidence on how they can impact labor outcomes and living conditions of recipient housholds across major metropolitan areas of a developing country. By doing this, it also elucidates households’ response mechanisms to this type of program.====The paper studies South Africa's national Housing Subsidies Scheme, which rolled-out at the end of Apartheid under the Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP). Through the program, local authorities construct housing units in greenfield development, which they later allocate to eligible households on an ownership basis for free. Allocation is done through municipal waiting lists. Since 1994, 2.8 million houses have been built under this program across South Africa, benefitting more than 12 million individuals (2015). The interest in studying this program lies in its large national scale, as it allows me to examine all six main metropolitan areas==== of a large country in sub-Saharan Africa====. A second motivating feature concerns the country's historical heritage. South African urban structures are influenced by almost half a century of Apartheid spatial planning, which has reinforced a gap between cities’ centers and peripheries. As a result, cities have very low densities, causing high average transport costs and long commuting times. These features make it difficult for low-income households residing in cities’ peripheries to access labor markets (Banerjee et al., 2008).==== An advantage of studying this program is that eligibility is based on an arbitrary income rule, with households earning less than R3501 per month eligible for housing under the scheme. This rule-based allocation allows me to identify the causal impact of the program by exploiting this cutoff under a fuzzy regression disconuity design (FRD).====Identification is thus based on comparing average outcomes of households just below and just above the income threshold, using being below the income threshold of R3501 as an instrument for receiving subsidized housing. The probability of receiving housing decreases sharply above R3500 among otherwise-eligible households. Assuming no manipulation of the assignment variable, this setting ensures greater internal consistency than other quasi-experimental methods (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). Using an array of statistical tests, I find no evidence of sorting at the threshold. I use four waves of panel data from the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) collected between 2008 and 2014, which documents households’ program status for obtaining their dwelling. Overall, my results are stable across a range of specifications, bandwidths, controls and sample restrictions.====This paper provides four main pieces of reduced-form evidence. First, I find that two to four years following RDP allocation, the labor supply of recipient households at the cutoff decreases by between half to one standard deviation. Overall, this decline is driven by a large drop of about 30 h in total weekly hours of paid work, which is consistent with almost one fewer employed household member. The gender decomposition shows that the reduction is larger for females through a reduction at their intensive margins, but male members also experience a non-significant drop. The share of unemployed and discouraged working-age adults also rises.====Second, relocated household members may be dropping out of the labor market due to increased distance to economic opportunities, which matches the predictions of the Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis (SMH) (Kain, 1968, Brueckner and Zenou, 2003, Gobillon et al., 2011). I find evidence that the distance from a household to the Central Business District (CBD) and employment nodes increase sharply by 12 to 13 km following RDP allocation. The fact that I find no significant effect on the monthly share of total household revenue spent on transport further suggests that households are not compensating by longer (more expensive) commutes, but are rather choosing to reduce their overall travel. Consistent with the SMH is the existence of high frictions in South Africa's urban labor markets due to red-lining, a reliance on informal networks and high commuting costs, which may increase reservation wages and the opportunity cost of time (Brueckner and Zenou, 2003, Magruder, 2010). Females may be more severely affected. In developing countries, women rely on fewer transport modes and are potentially more vulnerable to changes in distance (Baker et al., 2005).====Third, part of the decline in the labor supply could also reflect households’ higher wealth and shifts in their earning strategies following the relocation into a new house farther from economic opportunities. I explore the mechanisms of how households respond to these changes. I find that RDP recipients are 54 percentage points more likely to receive additional income from rent. While this shift may be a new earning strategy in response to the increased distance to jobs (i.e., by constructing and renting backyard rooms)====, it could also suggest that households may prefer to work less following a positive income shock. I find no evidence that the shifts result from compositional changes in households’ structures. Relocation does not seem to severely disrupt household composition in terms of labor capabilities. The age of the household head and the ages and number of children are not significantly affected, and there is no indication that only fewer mobile members move to the farther-away house. Other possible livelihood strategies, such as accrued reliance on government transfers and subsistence agriculture are also not significantly impacted.====Fourth, irrespective of the impact on labor supply, households that gain higher utility from housing may still prefer to receive RDP if the quality of their living conditions improves. I find limited evidence in this regard. All tested characteristics of neighborhood quality are not significantly affected. There is, however, an insignificant but increased perception of insecurity that may result from isolation at cities’ peripheries and the disruption of social networks. The loss of social networks has been raised as a major limitation of this type of relocation program in both developed and developing countries (Mills et al., 2006, Kling et al., 2007, Day and Cervero, 2010, Barnhardt et al., 2017). Conversely, I find a deterioration in housing amenities by half a standard deviation, primarily in the buildings’ physical structures (e.g., fragile walls, number of rooms). The fact that mobile households choose to relocate despite worse housing conditions suggests that improvement may occur through intangible features of housing quality, such as increased tenure security and the possibility of becoming homeowners. Subjective well-being is an important component of housing policies (Galiani et al., 2017). Information asymmetry on the true quality of the dwelling, which is only revealed after moving in, could also explain why households still chose to move.====While the findings in this paper remain valid for a short-term period of 2 to 4 years following relocation, they offer significant insights into the response mechanisms of low-income households to relocation programs, particularly on the trade-offs households are willing to make between location-specific characteristics, and thus access to economic opportunities, and housing. In short, I find that the primary impact of relocating is a reduction in the labor supply of households, mostly for women. In the short term at least, living farther from jobs may introduce frictions that limit available economic opportunities for relocated adults; dropping out of the labor market might also reflect a preference to work less and to exploit new income-strategies through renting. Overall, the findings here suggest that in contexts of high commuting costs, limited supply of low-income housing and complex labor markets, the location of dwellings can have a large effect on poor families’ earning strategies. To succeed, housing policies must consider these effects.====This paper is closely linked with a large literature in urban economics on residential sorting within cities. These papers have examined the role of commuting costs (Alonso, 1964, Mills, 1967, Muth, 1969), transport mode choices (Glaeser et al., 2008), amenities (Brueckner et al., 1999, Lall et al., 2008) and proximity to economic opportunities (Kain, 1968) as key determinants for choosing a residential location. Specifically, research related to the Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis has shown that workers’ job search efficiency may decrease with distance to jobs, and workers residing far away from jobs may have fewer incentives to search intensively (Zenou, 2009). This negative relationship might be exacerbated in the South African context due to the poor quality of public transit, complex urban labor markets with high unemployment (Magruder, 2010) and gender-segmentation.====This paper also relates to the large literature on the impact of housing lotteries and vouchers on the labor supply of beneficiaries in U.S. cities, with the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program being the most notorious. Most of these papers find null (Jacob, 2003, Kling et al., 2007) or negative impacts on the labor supply of recipient households (Jacob and Ludwig 2012; also, Mills et al. (2006) find a negative impact for the first year and null afterward). Only Chetty et al. (2015) find long-term improvements in children under the age of 13 at the time of moving. In developing countries, there are reasons to believe that labor supply responses to housing subsidies are more difficult to assess. Tenure insecurity, the predominance of informal employment, greater constraints on transport infrastructure and the close relationship between residential inequality and cities’ spatial layouts all make housing a greater complement to work.====Finally, this paper also adds to the nascent literature evaluating housing programs in cities in developing countries that has mostly focused on titling and slum upgrading programs (Field, 2007, Takeuchi et al., 2008, Galiani and Schargrodsky, 2010, Galiani et al., 2017. Barnhardt et al. (2017)==== is an exception to this trend. They provide the first experimental evidence of a housing lottery in Ahmedabad and find robust evidence that the target population was worse off in the long term (14 years) on a variety of socioeconomic measures, including labor supply. Two other papers have previously examined the RDP policy. Franklin (2015) estimates the causal effects of the South African RDP program on labor outcomes but focuses solely on slum dwellers in the city of Cape Town==== by de-facto studying the effect of titling on a subpopulation of the treated. Lall et al. (2012a) supports the results here. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to estimate the effect of a large housing program for low-income households across the major cities of a developing country. It adds to the evidence available to guide policy discussions.====The remainder of this paper is as follows. The next section outlines the theoretical mechanisms through which interactions between housing, location and labor supply are likely to occur. Section 3 describes the policy setting and the allocation mechanism. Section 4 outlines the empirical strategy and discusses the data and validity of the research design. Section 5 presents the study's main results.

I also find evidence of displacement, i.e. a tendency for private businesses to locate closer to a relocation site, moving out of areas at 1–2 km and 2–3 km distances into areas at 0–1 km distance. These ==== appear highly localized: the largest policy impact is found in areas that received the relocated jobs with ==== reducing sharply over distance.","Governments design a variety of place-based policies attempting to reverse the fate of economically declining areas and create employment opportunities for local residents. In the US, Enterprise and Empowerment Zone programs spur the creation of jobs by providing tax incentives to businesses located in designated areas.==== Similarly, French Enterprise Zone programs are targeted at discretely bound areas.==== The UK government follows a slightly different approach by designing either place-based policies with no-predetermined spatial scale (the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB)), or spatially-bound policies whose funding goes indirectly to businesses through local government (the Local Enterprise Growth Initiative (LEGI)).==== The UK government also uses relocation programs of public sector workers to address regional employment problems and to reduce spatial disparities in income. Strictly speaking, relocation programs of public sector workers are not ‘pure’ place-based policies. They address a variety of objectives, including delivering cost savings, re-organizing the government estate, and enhancing devolution.====When a public sector job is created in an area, it may have a local ‘multiplier effect’: it may create additional local jobs as a result of the increased demand for locally-produced goods and services. Conversely, it may trigger general equilibrium effects in the form of higher housing prices or higher local wages (see Moretti, 2010, Faggio and Overman, 2014). These general equilibrium effects may be stronger than the multiplier effect and result in a crowding out or displacement of local businesses.====The debate on the use of public sector worker relocations as a tool to boost regional development is not new. The UK's first government-sponsored review was commissioned in the 1960s (Flemming Review, 1963), followed by the Hardman Review (1973) and then by the Lawson-Thatcher Relocation Policy of 1988 (as cited by Northern Ireland Assembly, 2008). Notwithstanding the attention given by the government to this issue, there is scarce evidence of the effects of a public sector relocation program upon local labor markets. This study tries to fill this gap by assessing the local labor market impact of a public sector relocation initiative labelled the Lyons Review.====In 2004, Sir Michael Lyons led a UK government-sponsored independent study on the scope for public sector relocations out of London and the South East towards other UK destinations. The review proposed a relocation of about 20,000 civil service jobs within a six-year period. Thanks to the adoption of effective ‘push’ factors (such as relocation targets and property controls), the original target was delivered nearly a year ahead of schedule. By March 2010, the program had relocated more than 25,000 jobs. This program addressed a variety of objectives including the government desire to stimulate economic activity in less-prosperous areas with the aim of reducing spatial imbalances between regional UK and London. To the extent that the relocation program had any impact on local economic conditions, this paper aims to detect the causal effects of the intervention. Yet, this study is more than a policy evaluation: it informs about what happens when a small number of public sector jobs are moved to or created in some areas.====This paper uses panel data at a detailed geographic scale (the 2001 Census Output Area) covering years before and after the implementation of the program. The use of such detailed level of geography is particularly appropriate for analyzing small size relocations (as those studied here) and for identifying potential multiplier effects that operate at a very small spatial scale. On the other hand, conducting the analysis at the Output Area (OA) level hinders the possibility of detecting potential general equilibrium effects (e.g., changes in housing prices or local wages) operating at a wider geography.====My analysis is complicated by two factors: (1) the geographic spread of the policy is unknown ====; (2) destination areas are not randomly chosen. To solve these issues, I first construct treatment intensity variables: adapting the approach from Gibbons et al. (2011), I construct a measure of treatment intensity that is a non-parametric function of the distance to a relocation site. In other words, I assume that effects are additive and vary by distance. Second, I compare neighboring areas at increasing distance from a relocation site. In doing so, I also restrict the comparison to areas that are similar in terms of initial socio-economic and demographic characteristics.====My empirical strategy is to apply a treatment intensity approach, which can be considered an extension of a difference-in-differences approach with heterogeneous (rather than constant) treatment effects (see Angrist and Imbens, 1995). Similarly to a difference-in-differences approach, I exploit the temporal and spatial variation in the data. Differently from a difference-in-differences approach, I cannot clearly distinguish between ‘treated’ and ‘untreated’ areas. In fact, all areas can be considered as treated, but they are treated at a different level of intensity. Areas close to a relocation site should be affected (i.e., treated) more intensively than areas further away with intensity decreasing monotonically with distance.====The policy stretches over an eight-year period (2003–2010). Given potential difficulties in disentangling the impact of the 2008 recession from that of the relocation program after 2007, this study focuses on estimating 2003–2007 effects. It finds that the dispersal of public sector jobs that followed the implementation of the Lyons Review (2004) had an overall positive impact on private sector employment at the local level. Results suggest that the arrival of 10 civil service jobs in an area spurs the creation of about 11 jobs in the private sector. It also affects the sector composition of local jobs: it stimulates services, whereas it has no impact on manufacturing. The study also finds evidence of displacement. There is, in fact, a tendency for private businesses to locate closer to a relocation site, moving out of areas at 1–2 km and 2–3 km distances and into areas at 0–1 km distance. In addition, the study finds that effects are highly localized: i.e., the largest impact is found in areas that received the relocated jobs; spillover effects for an average OA are substantially smaller than the direct effect; and spillover effects reduce sharply over distance. There is no impact beyond the 0–3 km ring.====These findings seem robust to a series of checks: verifying that central government employment indeed expanded in areas that received the relocated jobs; conducting a falsification or placebo test by estimating the impact of the relocation program during a pre-treatment period (2001–2003); replicating the analysis using a coarser geographic scale (the 2001 Lower Layer Super Output Area); and investigating whether larger size relocations are associated with a larger policy impact. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to estimate the policy impact over a longer time period (2003–2010); to explore potential changes in the population demographics in the areas that received relocated jobs; and to investigate the impact of removing government jobs from areas of the South East.====This paper contributes to the growing literature on the evaluation of place-based government policies. As also noted by Einio and Overman (2016), earlier studies were impaired by the problem of non-random placement.==== Later studies have combined data at a finer spatial scale with well-designed identification strategies to overcome the problem of causal inference in non-experimental settings. In the US, Enterprise and Empowerment Zone programs have been successfully evaluated by Neumark and Kolko, 2010, Busso and Kline, 2008; and Busso et al. (2013). Other less well-known programs, like the New Market Tax Credit, have also been carefully evaluated (see Freedman, 2012 and 2015). In Europe and the UK, evaluations of the French Enterprise zone programs, the UK LEGI and SRB stand out for accuracy.==== To help identification, this study combines a treatment intensity approach, a set of treatment intensity variables and fine spatial scale data as presently available.====This paper also makes an original contribution to the literature on the dispersal of public sector workers. To my knowledge, no previous study has looked at the local impact of a public sector relocation program using detailed spatial data and taking identification issues seriously. Previous out-of-London relocation studies have focused on the financial costs and benefits of the moves (see, among others, Goddard and Pye, 1977, Ashcroft et al., 1988, Marshall et al., 1991, Deloitte 2004); some have provided descriptive evidence usually based on interviews with internal managers responsible for implementing relocations and/or secondary data sources (see, e.g., Marshall et al., 2003, Experian 2004); others have used regional input-output models==== aimed at ==== predicting the local multiplier impact of proposed dispersals (see, also, Ashcroft and Swales, 1982a and 1982b).====In addition, the paper contributes to a small literature (see Rosenthal and Strange, 2003, Rosenthal and Strange, 2008, Arzaghi and Henderson, 2008, Andersson et al., 2004, Andersson et al., 2009) on the spatial range of agglomeration effects. These effects seem to be local. Looking at the impact of additional employees on small new establishments in the US, Rosenthal and Strange (2003) suggest that external economies of agglomeration are sharply attenuated by distance. When studying the advertising agency industry in New York City, Arzaghi and Henderson (2008) document significant productivity gain from the co-location of firms in Manhattan, but gains attenuate rapidly over space. Turning to Sweden, Andersson et al., 2004, Andersson et al., 2009) investigate the impact of university decentralization and find substantial but highly localized spillovers on firm productivity over distance. The present study also finds that effects are concentrated within the first few kilometers from a relocation site.====Faggio and Overman (2014) is the paper most closely related to the present one. Using data on 352 English Local Authorities (LAs), they look at the impact of changes in public sector employment on the local labor market. They find that public sector employment has no impact on total private sector employment at the LA level. They do find, however, that public sector employment changes the local composition of private sector jobs: it stimulates the provision of locally-produced services (the non-tradable sector), while it has a negative effect on manufacturing (the tradable sector). The results in this paper are largely consistent with those found in Faggio and Overman (2014).====There are, however, important differences between the two studies. First, Faggio and Overman (2014)’s analysis is not a policy evaluation. They do not explore the specific impact of the Lyons Review or of any other place-based policy, but they look at 2003–2007 changes in total public sector employment at the local level. As documented in Cribb et al. (2014), these changes were largely driven by the UK public sector expansion in health and education.==== On the contrary, the present study provides the first thorough evaluation of a relocation program and focuses on the dispersal of 25,000 central government jobs.====Second, as already noted, Faggio and Overman (2014) conduct the analysis at a much higher level of aggregation (using 352 English LAs) than the one used here (based on about 150,000 Output Areas covering England, Wales and Scotland). Conducting the analysis at the Output Area level strengthens the ability to capture potential multiplier effects – particularly if these effects are localized and disappear sharply over distance. Conversely, conducting the analysis at the LA level might hinder the possibility of detecting such localized effects, even though it helps identify potential general equilibrium effects that tend to operate at a larger geographic scale than the OA.====Comparing the results, Faggio and Overman (2014) identify local multiplier and crowding-out effects operating at the LA level: they find that 100 additional public sector jobs in an area spurred the creation of about 50 service jobs while crowding out 40 manufacturing jobs. The present study detects local multiplier and displacement effects operating at the OA level: it finds that the dispersal of civil service jobs has an overall positive impact on private sector employment, mainly driven by the expansion of local services; and that spillover effects are largely contained within the first three kilometers from a relocation site. The seemingly contradicting results of the two studies are explainable in light of the differences just discussed.====It is worth noting that the debate on public sector relocations is not limited to the UK.==== Little attention, however, has been paid in previous (largely European) research to estimate the local labor market impact of a relocation program. An exception is the paper by Becker et al. (2018), which looks at the rise of Bonn as the new federal capital of Western Germany at the end of World War II. They find that total employment and population in Bonn substantially increased after 1949 relative to a group of 40 control cities. They also find that the impact of government jobs on private sector employment was modest and concentrated in the non-tradable sector. Another exception is the work by Jofre-Monseny et al. (2018), which estimates the effects of public job expansions on decennial changes (1980–1990 and 1990–2001) in the employment and population of Spanish cities. They find that one additional public sector job increases non-tradable employment by 0.9 jobs with hardly any impact on the tradable sector. Yet, they point out that these new jobs do not translate into a substantial reduction in local unemployment as better labor market conditions attract new workers to the city.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background on the relocation program, Section 3 discusses a simple conceptual framework and Section 4 introduces the empirical strategy. While Section 5 describes the data used, Section 6 presents the results. Section 7 provides robustness checks and extensions.

We show how these patterns reflect the preferences of agents and the efficiency of transportation and communication technologies. With one population of homogeneous individuals, the economy is characterized by a uniform distribution or by a periodic distribution of central places having the same size. The interaction between two distinct populations may give rise to a hierarchy of central places with one or several primate cities.","Ever since (Christaller, 1933), economists, geographers, and regional scientists have shown that cities form hierarchical systems displaying some regularity (see, e.g., Gabaix and Ioannides, 2004). This begs the following two questions. First, what are the conditions for systems of cities and urban hierarchies to emerge in a featureless space? Second, how can this process be derived within a microeconomic model from the interplay between local and global interactions among agents pursuing their own interests? In this paper, we develop and use a simple framework in response to these challenging questions.====The term ==== is used in this paper as shorthand for sites that display peaks in the spatial distribution of economic agents. Our aim is to show how a pattern of equally-spaced central places having the same size and a hierarchy of central places characterized by the existence of large and small cities, may emerge from a symmetry-breaking process (Matsuyama, 2008). To do this, we follow the main thread of spatial economics by assuming that the distribution of individuals is the outcome of the interplay between agglomeration forces and dispersion forces. However, we differ from the gallery of existing models in two major respects.====First, most existing models use a geometry characterized by some kind of boundedness condition and this matters for the nature of the equilibrium outcome. For example, Beckmann (1976) showed that land use and social interactions give rise to a bell-shaped distribution of individuals over a compact interval. His result is driven by this assumption as the peak tends to vanish when this interval becomes arbitrarily wide. Mossay and Picard (2011) revisit Beckmann’s model when individuals are distributed over a circle and show that the equilibrium involves multiple outcomes, having any odd number of identical and evenly spaced cities. So, the choice of a particular geometry may critically affect the results. To rule this out, we assume away any “first-nature” asymmetries by working with the simplest possible seamless and unbounded space, i.e., the ====. The most natural way to think of this assumption is to suppose that land, which is locally scarce, is available everywhere. We then run the following thought experiment: what are the spatial patterns that emerge from the interaction among agents? More specifically, we determine the conditions that force a perfectly dispersed population to become a regular or a hierarchical pattern of settlements. In such a context, the spatial equilibria obtained are the solutions of Fredholm integral equations, a concept which does not belong to the toolbox of urban economists.====Second, while most existing models emphasize specific effects which are seldom combined within the same framework, we focus on two general effects, namely, a ==== and an ==== The former depends on the local population density and the latter, which aims to capture different types of interaction across dispersed individuals such as flows of people or of information and knowledge, depends on the whole distribution of individuals over space. Since we do not specify the details of these two effects, we consider a bare–bones framework in which both effects are captured by ==== which are consistent with different narratives.==== Although our setting has no explicit market, it is our contention that the interplay between the above two external effects takes on board several of the market and non-market interactions which are at work in urban systems.====In this paper, we build on Papageorgiou and Smith (1983) who maintained that the spatial distribution of identical individuals is determined by their attitudes regarding human interaction and by the properties of the spatial interaction field itself. Their analysis was limited to the necessary and sufficient conditions that render a uniform distribution of identical agents unstable. Our scope is much broader in that we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of a flat or uneven population pattern in a setting where locations and flows are determined simultaneously. More specifically, in the case of one population of identical individuals, we show that, when individuals put a relatively high weight on spatial interaction as opposed to the local congestion effect, ====. How big are these areas and how packed are people depend on the attitude of agents toward congestion and human interaction. In particular, we are able to determine the conditions under which the population distribution is close or far away from the uniform distribution. Importantly, ====, which is reminiscent of the early stages of urbanization, ====. What is more, a growing population affects the equilibrium utility level according to the way the population is distributed. Individual welfare decreases when the equilibrium outcome involves a dispersed population because in this case the congestion effect is dominant. By contrast, the equilibrium utility level increases with the population size as long as central places exist.====We also show that an improvement in spatial interaction possibilities through new communication devices or more efficient transportation has a non-monotone impact on the density of central places. Initially, as the interactions among individuals become easier, their distribution takes the form of a denser system of central places. However, beyond some threshold, the additional gains associated with growing interactions are more than compensated by the costs generated by a rising congestion. In other words, technological devices that make interactions among individuals easier lead, first, to a more compact urban system and, then, to a sparser packing of central places. This is reminiscent of the bell-shaped curve of spatial development, which states that agents are dispersed when transport costs are either high or low and agglomerated when transport costs take on intermediate values (Krugman, Venables, 1995, Puga, 1999, Ottaviano, Tabuchi, Thisse, 2002). In those papers, like in ours, ====.====The most enduring problem in spatial economics is probably the existence of an urban system involving large and medium-sized cities, towns, and villages. To deal with this problem, we must extend our baseline model in which central places have the same size. A natural extension is to introduce heterogeneity across individuals by working with ==== such that individuals are homogeneous within each population but heterogeneous between populations, and to impose a complete spatial interdependence between the two populations. In this context, we show that ====. Furthermore, the share of each population in an urban area varies with its location. Thus, we may conclude that the central places are here the outcome of a richer pattern of interactions, which occur ==== and not only ==== populations, than in the case of a single population.====Depending on the type of interaction between the two populations and the parameters that characterize each population, the spatial economy may display a whole range of distinct patterns. In the first one, the spatial equilibrium involves two uniformly distributed populations. In this case, the interactions between the two populations are too weak for the blending of these populations to generate a steady-state that departs from what we observe with each population separately. The second pattern involves a periodic distribution. The third pattern leads to richer implications. Indeed, the superimposition of the two populations yields ====. Although the distribution of the total population may exhibit one primate city and smaller cities whose size decreases with the distance to the top city, as argued by Christaller (1933) and Lösch (1940), the urban system may also involve several large cities, together with intermediate cities whose size need not decrease with the distance to the large cities. Two points are worth stressing here. First, the two populations must interact for a hierarchy of central places to emerge at the equilibrium outcome. Second, the two population distributions are interdependent and determined simultaneously. In this context, the equilibrium distribution of each population differs from the distribution that would emerge if this population were alone.====Thus, despite its great simplicity, our setting allows us to account for a rich set of urban patterns. Equally important, it provides a background for two of the main features of classical central place theory: (i) a pattern of equidistant and identical settlements and (ii) a hierarchy of cities. Our analysis also shows that there is no reason to expect the urban system to obey the rigid, pyramidal structure assumed by Christaller and Lösch. Instead, the urban system may involve two or several large urban agglomerations at the top of the urban hierarchy. It is also worth stressing that our setting differs from most urban system models, which assume away spatial frictions across cities whose locations are unspecified. To the best of our knowledge, no existing contribution has been able to generate a range of results comparable to ours within a microeconomic framework as parsimonious as ours.==== How to place our contribution in the field of spatial economics? Central place theory, based on the pioneering work of Christaller (1933) and Lösch (1940), aims to explain why economic activities are distributed over a system of cities in which the number of activities performed in a city rises with its size, and where cities having the same size are equally spaced (Mulligan et al., 2012). However, the bulk of classical central place theory has been directed towards identifying geometric conditions under which a superimposition of regular structures is possible. Here lies the Achilles Heel of the regional science approach to central place theory. These considerations are only interesting if they are based on solid microeconomic foundations. Unfortunately, such geometric analyses have not been rationalized through the choices made by optimizing agents.====New economic geography has the opposite problem. It relies on a full-fledged general equilibrium setup (Krugman, 1991, Fujita, Krugman, Venables, 1999a). But since most models typically use a two-region setting, they do not permit to deal with the emergence of settlements and the formation of a hierarchy of settlements. There are exceptions, however. Fujita and Mori (1997) use an economic geography setting to show that cities are created at more or less equal distances when the total population grows in an economy with one manufacturing sector. Fujita et al. (1999b) extend this setting to a multisector economy and show how a hierarchy of cities may emerge. Tabuchi and Thisse (2011) also use an economic geography setting to prove that decreasing transportation costs foster the emergence of big cities supplying two goods, which coexist with small and specialized cities in which only one good is produced.====The spatial competition approach à la Hotelling has attracted less attention. Eaton and Lipsey (1982) appealed to multipurpose shopping as an economic foundation for the existence of clusters in which spatially dispersed consumers buy different goods available in dispersed shops. That consumers combine their purchases to reduce travel costs creates demand externalities which firms can exploit by locating close to firms selling other goods. Unfortunately, this approach becomes very quickly intractable. Indeed, with several goods, trip-chaining implies a complex structure of substitution between outlets. Hsu (2012) proposed to circumvent this difficulty by assuming that firms deliver their products to consumers. In this case, a consumer buys each product from the firm charging the lowest delivered price regardless of where the providers of the other goods are. Hsu showed that there exists an equilibrium that displays the hierarchical structure of central place theory, that is, all the goods available in a central place of a given order are also available in all central places of higher order. In these two papers, distance between buyers and sellers is the main driver.====In urban economics, (Henderson, 1974, Henderson, 1988) has developed a compelling approach to describe the formation of urban systems in which cities are specialized. However, Henderson assumed that shipping goods between cities is costless. The same applies to more recent and richer models of urban systems such as (Behrens and Robert-Nicoud, 2015) and (Davis and Dingel, 2019). The various attempts made to explain the urban hierarchy through the Zipf Law also ignore where cities are located. This is not an innocuous assumption because cities are typically anchored in specific locations, while trade flows are gravitational in nature. Quantitative spatial models, such as (Diamond, 2016) and (Gaubert, 2018), provide a possible way out by combining within and between-cities frictions. However, these models aim to replicate real-world urban systems and to assess the impact of various shocks or counterfactuals.====Finally, a handful of papers seek to explain how one or several employment centers emerge within a city. They all rely on the trade-off between the benefits that firms enjoy when they are located close to each other and the higher wage firms must pay to workers to compensate them for the higher land rent and the longer commutes caused by the agglomeration of firms (Ogawa and Fujita, 1980; Fujita, Ogawa, 1982, Berliant, Peng, Wang, 2002, Lucas, Rossi-Hansberg, 2002. These papers share the same fundamental idea as us since workers compete for land while firms seek proximity. Like us, they consider gravity-like reduced forms in which spatial interactions are presumed. However, we pursue a different objective and use a different modeling strategy.====In the next section, we present our baseline model with one population of homogeneous individuals and discuss various interpretations of the agglomeration and dispersion forces. We then study the equilibrium outcome and determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a regular pattern of identical settlements to emerge in a world which is otherwise featureless. In Section 3, we consider the case of two populations such that agents interact both within and between populations. The blending of the two distributions shows how a hierarchy of cities hosting agents belonging to both populations may come into being.

We exploit location and transaction data on imports by U.S. firms and adapt the Ellison and Glaeser (1997) index to construct a product-country-specific measure of supplier concentration for U.S. importers. Results show that U.S. importers source in a more spatially concentrated manner from countries with weaker contract enforcement. We find support for the idea that, where formal contract enforcement is weak, local supplier networks compensate by sharing information to facilitate matching and transactions.","Do institutions shape the geographic concentration of industrial activity? While we know that patterns of geographic concentration vary across countries, we know little about their determinants. In this paper, we examine how variation in the quality of institutions shapes the spatial organization of economic activity across countries by influencing sourcing patterns in international trade. Specifically, we ask whether U.S. importers source in a more spatially dispersed or concentrated manner from countries with weaker contract enforcement regimes.====The relationship between institutions and spatial patterns of global sourcing strategies is, ====, ambiguous. On the one hand, decentralization forces may result in more dispersed patterns of global sourcing under weak institutions. For example, countries with weak institutional environments might be more susceptible to outbreak of violence and conflict or suffer from weak state capacity to manage recovery from catastrophic events like natural disasters. Firms sourcing from such environments may prefer to diversify their suppliers across regions to mitigate the risk that supply is cut off for a period of time after an adverse event (Cole et al., 2017; Henriet et al., 2012).====On the other hand, weaker institutions may result in higher spatial concentration in global sourcing patterns. First, importing firms sourcing from a country with a weaker contract enforcement regime may be more likely to rely on their network of suppliers when establishing new supplier links in a city. A poor contracting environment can result in high transaction costs and frequent losses for firms from hold-ups or reneging by either party in a business transaction. Where the legal system cannot effectively uphold contracts, informal institutions can substitute for them by providing information on the reputation and reliability of suppliers or by sanctioning default, thereby mitigating some of the costs weak institutions impose (Greif, 1993, McMillan and Woodruff, 1999). Second, institutionally weaker countries may be characterized by primate cities where economic activity tends to concentrate (Ades and Glaeser, 1995). Finally, trade with institutionally weak countries might be routed disproportionately through intermediaries, who might operate primarily from port cities or urban centers (Ahn et al., 2011).====We empirically evaluate the net impact of institutional quality on supplier concentration using the universe of confidential U.S. merchandise customs data. We observe import transactions of a product by a U.S. importer from distinct suppliers located across cities within a country. We construct an index of supplier concentration for each U.S. importer specific to a product and country. We adapt the index of spatial concentration in Ellison and Glaeser (1997) to measure supplier concentration, henceforth EG index, which varies at the importer-product-country level. In the context of our study, the EG index measures the concentration of suppliers to a U.S. importer above the overall concentration of exporters to the U.S., the latter capturing exporters’ tendencies to agglomerate in space. Thus, our measure of supplier spatial concentration isolates importer-level deviations from overall exporter concentration within a product-country pair.====We find that U.S. importers tend to source in a more spatially concentrated manner in countries with weaker institutions. Our results indicate that a decrease of ten in the number of procedures required to legally enforce a contract (about 28% of the mean across countries) is associated with a decrease in the EG supplier concentration index of 0.5. We also find that a decrease of 100 in the number of days required to legally enforce a contract (about 21% of the mean across countries) is associated with a decrease in the EG supplier concentration index of 0.1. These results are robust to including a battery of control variables, an instrumental variables estimation strategy to account for the endogeneity of institutions, using alternate measures of institutions and the spatial concentration of sourcing, and utilizing samples in different years.====Next, we explore the mechanisms through which weaker institutional quality is associated with greater spatial concentration of sourcing by U.S. importers. We find strong support that the negative relationship between contract enforcement and the spatial concentration of sourcing persists even after we exclude primate cities and suppliers that are potential trade intermediaries from our analysis. We also find evidence consistent with the idea that costs associated with weak institutions may be mitigated through reliance on local supplier networks.====This research makes two key contributions to the urban agglomeration literature. First, although prior studies have established differences in patterns of spatial concentration of economic activity across countries, we know little about their determinants (Chauvin et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, our paper is one of the first to propose institutional quality as one such determinant, by focusing on its role in shaping sourcing patterns in international trade. Second, we establish patterns in the geographic concentration of sourcing by U.S. importers consistent with the idea that local business networks facilitate spillovers in information (Fernandes and Tang, 2014, Kamal and Sundaram, 2016, Koenig, 2009, Koenig et al., 2010, Lovely et al., 2005).==== Our finding of foreign buyers’ propensity to match with domestic suppliers in a spatially concentrated manner suggest that localization economies for production may arise not only via input sharing, labor market pooling, and knowledge spillovers but also because clusters of domestic suppliers may be able to attract more foreign buyers than suppliers acting individually.====This paper also contributes to the empirical international trade literature that demonstrates the importance of institutional quality in determining trade patterns, including propensity to import differentiated intermediate inputs (Bernard et al., 2010), export dynamics (Araujo et al., 2016), and comparative advantage (Antràs and Helpman, 2008, Levchenko, 2007, Nunn, 2007). Complementing this rich body of work, we highlight an additional role for institutions in influencing international trade - spatial patterns in global sourcing.====The next section outlines our conceptual framework followed by Section 3, where we develop our empirical specifications. Section 4 provides a description of the data sources and summary statistics followed by our results in Section 5. The final section concludes.",Do institutions determine economic Geography?

While these storms were particularly damaging, they were not without precedent: More than two hundred natural disasters with losses exceeding one billion 2016 dollars have occurred in the United States between 1980 and 2016. Six of the ten costliest disasters were hurricanes, causing over $345 billion in total damages and more than 2000 deaths (Smith and Katz, 2013). The most deadly and damaging of these storms was Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf coast in August 2005. Hurricanes’ economic cost is immediately experienced by the impacted communities through damaged infrastructure and disrupted economic activity, but large federal and private insurance programs spread those costs across the country in the long-run. Federal emergency insurance programs often provide additional resources to residents of impacted regions for years following the disaster.==== In this study, we examine the short- and long-term net aggregate effect of Hurricane Katrina and those insurance programs on the consumption, financial health, homeownership, mobility, and household composition of individuals whose residences were impacted by the storm.====Because many residents of hurricane-impacted regions relocate in the years after the storm, and may continue receiving federal support following their relocation, it is challenging to conduct representative follow-up surveys of impacted residents. As a result, most studies of post-Katrina outcomes have focused on short run effects one or two years after the storm (e.g. Fussell, Sastry, VanLandingham, 2010, Zissimopoulos, Karoly, 2010, Sastry, Gregory, 2014), and most studies of natural disasters’ long-run impacts ignore post-storm migration by treating regions, not individuals, as the units of analysis (e.g. Cavallo et al., 2013, Barone and Mocetti, 2014). In this study, we analyze credit report data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a quarterly representative panel of most US residents, to follow residents of Katrina-impacted regions from the time of the storm until 2016, over ten years later. Individuals randomly drawn into the CCP remain indefinitely, enabling representative analysis of hurricane-impacted residents a decade after Hurricane Katrina. Our focus on the micro-level impact of the storm allows us to analyze the storm’s distributional impacts ====, assigning treatment to individuals based on their pre-storm residential location.====Rather than assessing the aggregate effectiveness of post-Katrina policies in promoting New Orleans’ recovery (see Deryugina et al., 2018), we focus on heterogeneity in long-term net impacts across geographic areas that were differentially impacted by the storm. Using a methodology similar in spirit to a spatial regression-discontinuity design, we analyze four distributional outcomes of natural disasters and related federal policies. First, extending previous work by Gallagher and Hartley (2017), we examine outcomes within the city of New Orleans, comparing residents that experienced sustained flooding to those whose homes were outside the most severely flooded area. This analysis tests the degree to which federal policies mitigate welfare gaps between those most damaged by the disaster and less-affected residents living in the same region; we call this the policies’ ==== effectiveness. Rather than explicitly parameterizing welfare, we present effects on a variety of economic and social outcomes which are themselves components of individuals’ broader welfare.====Second, in contrast to earlier Katrina impact studies, we compare the outcomes of residents of the Gulf Opportunity (GO) Zone–a hurricane-impacted region designated by the federal government in order to target substantial tax incentives to promote economic recovery–to those living in the five states surrounding the GO Zone.==== The GO Zone encompassed six million residents, or 2.03 percent of the US population. We match GO Zone residents to observably-similar residents of nearby counties and estimate the degree to which they were impacted by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent policy response. These residents faced a wide range of flooding and wind damage (with many residents actually experiencing little or no damage), but were safeguarded by private insurance and substantial emergency aid from the federal government. In our GO Zone analysis we first exclude New Orleans, comparing residents of less severely impacted areas closer to the border to residents living outside the GO Zone. This analysis represents a test of federal policies’ ==== effectiveness, or the degree to which they ‘normalize’ outcomes for residents of less-damaged communities relative to residents outside the disaster’s geographic scope. We then repeat the analysis for the entire GO Zone area, providing an assessment of how ==== impacted communities in the greater GO zone area fared compared to those outside the impacted region.====Third, we test the ==== of the policies’ effectiveness by estimating heterogeneous outcomes across three demographic divisions which may have been importantly and differentially affected by the storm: Age, race, and income.==== Finally, we examine post-Katrina migration from New Orleans and assess the effectiveness of federal policies in limiting long-term population losses and in reversing short-run population outflows from the area hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina. In addition to mapping the long-term destinations of former New Orleans residents, we compare inundated and non-inundated residents to estimate migration patterns specific to inundated residents.====The region affected by Hurricane Katrina was non-randomly selected, determined by the geographical path of the storm and by topological and engineering features of New Orleans. To evaluate distributional impacts, for each subpopulation of interest we use difference-in-differences event study analysis to control for individual- and time-specific variation in characteristics and outcomes. Following (Hirano et al., 2003), we apply propensity score weighting estimated from three years of residents’ pre-Katrina socioeconomic characteristics to account for regional differences in those characteristics, and show that nearly all of our weighted outcomes of interest are balanced across treatment group for five years before the hurricane.====Our analysis of the impact of Hurricane Katrina on household finance is related to that of Gallagher and Hartley (2017), who also use the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel for their analysis, while our analysis of the storm’s impact on mobility and household composition is related to Deryugina et al. (2018), who use tax return data from the Internal Revenue Service. Our study, which in part confirms those earlier papers’ findings, augments them in two important ways. First, the previous studies only examined short- and medium-term effects of the storm and policies (3 and 8 years, respectively), whereas we find important dynamics in impact magnitude up to 11 years after the storm, and especially around the Great Recession. These differential effects are particularly important for policy analysis given the lengthy federal presence in the Gulf Coast area, with Katrina-related programs continuing to provide more than $300 million dollars of local expenditure per year until at least 2012.==== Second, both of these previous studies focus exclusively on outcomes for the city of New Orleans (where the hurricane was particularly damaging) as a case study of the impact of natural disasters in the United States; the former compares more- and less-flooded areas of the city, while the latter compares the outcomes of New Orleans residents to those of 10 demographically-similar American cities. Our study analyzes the impact on the most storm-impacted parts of the city, but also examines the broader effect of storm policies on the large Gulf Opportunity Zone that was affected by the storm, finding that these more-peripheral residents–who vastly outnumber those impacted by New Orleans’ failed levees–actually obtained some long-run benefits from the storm’s policy response relative to comparable residents just outside the Zone.==== Other complementary work includes Groen et al. (2016), who study labor market outcomes in the coastal region surrounding New Orleans and find evidence of net increases in average earnings among impacted residents over seven years following Katrina.====Note that regional heterogeneity in the net impact of the hurricane not only captures differences in insurance coverage but also differences in economic damages, which themselves reflect differences in the storm’s intensity and impact, as well as exposure and vulnerability to risk (including quality of construction and damage abatement activity) which vary with the average income of the local population (see Kellenberg and Mobarak, 2008 in a cross-country context). Strobl (2011) similarly showed the importance of measuring impacts at the local level, finding that hurricanes have an annual negative impact at the county level, but no effect at the state or national level. Evidence of geographic heterogeneity in impacts have been found for other natural disasters as well. Instead of inundation level and FEMA disaster designation, Elliott et al. (2015) combine actual typhoon track data with a wind field model to derive an index of potential damage to evaluate the economic effects of tropical storms on coastal China. Using panel data they find evidence of large negative short-term effects on local economic activity when measured locally (using night-light intensity data), but not at more aggregated geographic levels. Siodla (2015) exploits variation (and boundaries) across city blocks in fire damage associated with the 1906 San Francisco fire to study post-fire location-specific changes in land use and residential density.====In New Orleans, we define ‘inundation’ as experiencing at least four feet of flood water, following (McCarthy et al., 2006) definition of “Severe Damage” following Hurricane Katrina, although we find similar impact estimates based on alternative flooding thresholds.==== We find modest but persistent effects on inundated residents’ use of auto and consumer debt, bankruptcy behavior, and credit scores; inundated residents’ credit scores immediately and persistently dropped about six points, or 0.05 standard deviations, and consumer debt declined by $150 per quarter (persisting until at least 2013). On the other hand, we find large persistent increases in migration and declines in homeownership rates; a decade after the storm, inundated homeowners remained ten percentage points less likely to own a home and seven percentage points less likely to reside in New Orleans. The estimates show that many inundated homeowners who moved out of New Orleans became renters. Furthermore, inundated residents remained more likely to have recently changed residences (in the past three years) as late as 2011, after which their mobility behavior reverted to that of the non-flooded control group. Household size immediately declined (by about 0.15 adults per household), with a marked transition from large extended-family households to single-adult residences (see Rendall, 2011), but the gap had largely disappeared a decade after the storm.====Among the inundated, older, higher-income, and white residents were more likely than their respective counterparts to evacuate New Orleans immediately after Hurricane Katrina, but we find little additional evidence of heterogeneous impacts across demographic group. In particular, we find no evidence that residents of mostly-black flooded neighborhoods faced more negative consumption, delinquency, homeownership, or partnership outcomes than residents of mostly-white flooded neighborhoods, despite our study’s sufficient power to identify such differences.====Seven percent of New Orleans residents evacuated the city after Hurricane Katrina ====, with 13 different US states each still hosting over 500 adult evacuees in 2016. The storm’s long-term impact on out-migration contributed to large and persistent declines in the city’s population and economy. A controlled post-treatment comparison suggests that inundated New Orleans residents were more likely to move to neighboring and nearby states than their non-inundated neighbors in the year after the storm, and ten years later were more than 60 percent more likely to have migrated to Georgia and other parts of Louisiana, but they were more than 40 percent less likely to have moved north to states like North Carolina and New York; indeed they were 33 percent less likely to have moved to any Mid-Atlantic or New England state. This storm-induced change in destinations with dissimilar economic conditions in turn played a role in mediating the overall impact of the storm on the displaced and affected.====Overall, our New Orleans findings suggest a partial success of insurance and government programs in minimizing long-term intensive-margin gaps in consumption behavior and financial health outcomes, as well as those programs’ success in distributing funding across demographic groups, but suggest a failure to redress the long-term decline in homeownership that remains more than ten years after the storm.====In the expansive GO Zone, from which we initially exclude New Orleans, we find that Hurricane Katrina had immediate, substantial, and statistically-significant negative effects on consumption and homeownership. However, these declines were short-lived; by 2015, GO Zone residents were two percentage points ==== likely to own a home than non-residents. This increase in homeownership was similar for pre-storm renters and owners. Interestingly, a much greater share of pre-storm homeowners paid off their mortgage on their house after the storm, compared to unaffected pre-storm homeowners, presumably using insurance payouts. The impact also marked the beginning of a medium-term increase in residents’ credit scores along with decreased prevalence of delinquency, foreclosure, and bankruptcy. Moreover, by 2013 those who resided in the GO Zone at the time of the storm tended to have higher average consumer debt (mostly credit card)–by as much as $160 (4 percent)–than those who lived outside the GO Zone before the storm. Given their lower delinquency rate, these trends suggest that the aftermath of the hurricane provided long-term net consumption benefits for GO Zone residents.====Given the relatively small size of New Orleans relative to the expansive GO Zone area, it is perhaps unsurprising that the findings for the GO Zone residents overall do not materially change when New Orleans residents are included. While seeing slightly larger short- and medium-term negative effects, we find larger longer-term positive effects on consumption. As expected, we also find much larger increases in relocation rates relative to those living in the “unaffected” area outside the GO Zone.====These results provide some support for the theory that post-storm insurance policies were more spatially diffuse than the storm’s economic damage, providing some GO Zone residents with long-run net subsidies relative to residents of neighboring counties.==== Moreover, we find that these net subsidies were progressive–somewhat larger for young and low-income residents–and appear broadly similar for residents of black and white GO Zone neighborhoods. Restricting our analysis to counties within 25 miles of the Go Zone border (with similar results for 15 and 35 mile bands), we find that these net subsidies cannot be explained by the Zone’s peripheral residents, suggesting that residents of counties closer to (but not including) New Orleans, where flooding and high winds would have been non-negligible but limited, benefited the most from post-storm policies relative to their storm impact.====In Section 2 we provide some background on Hurricane Katrina and the various governmental programs implemented to insure residents against its associated damage. We introduce our dataset, the Consumer Credit Panel, in Section 3 and discuss our empirical approach in Section 4. Section 5–7 present our baseline results for each part of our analysis–the impact on inundated residents within the city of New Orleans, the storm’s impact on migration from New Orleans, and the impact on residents of the GO Zone within the Five States region–along with results by age, race, and income level Section 8 concludes.",Long-run net distributionary effects of federal disaster insurance: The case of Hurricane Katrina,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300142,March 2019,2019,Research Article,159.0

These place-based initiatives emphasise the preventative value of multi-agency work to enhance ==== safety and social inclusion. The purpose of this paper is to present empirical evidence on the effectiveness of neighbourhood renewal programs by estimating the impact of the UK's Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) program on crime rates across England between 2000 and 2007. Because the NRF was only made available to the most deprived local areas in England, we are able to estimate its effects using a Differences-in-Differences (DiD) approach and a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design. Our DiD estimates indicate that the NRF led to improvements in the rates of property and violent crime of between 10 and 25%, with analysis of treatment intensity effects suggesting that for every £1 per capita of NRF monies, crime rates improved by 0.3–0.6%. Our RD estimates reveal that these improvements are especially strong around the threshold for program eligibility – a finding that is particularly robust for reductions in property crime. Furthermore, using a spatial DiD, we identify the diffusion of crime prevention benefits from areas receiving NRF funding to neighbouring areas that did not receive funding. Our results therefore suggest that neighbourhood renewal programs are effective strategies for reducing crime.","Neighbourhood renewal programs are place-based interventions for the regeneration of distressed urban areas, and are a common tool of economic development policy in North America, Europe and elsewhere (Carmon, 1999, Couch et al., 2008, Givord et al., 2018, González Pampillón et al., 2017, Judd and Parkinson, 1990). Central to most renewal programs is a recognition of the need for partnerships between public, private and non-profit agencies to address the deep-seated problems facing disadvantaged communities (Bailey et al., 1995, van Gent et al., 2009). Private-led actions to encourage co-ordinated strategies can play an important role in driving the renewal of distressed urban areas (see, e.g., Brooks, 2008, Cook and MacDonald, 2011, MacDonald et al., 2013). Nevertheless, government-sponsored multi-agency place-based programs, such as Federal Empowerment Zones (Busso et al., 2013), have also been implemented to promote sustainable community development in a number of countries. One high-profile example of such a place-based program was the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF), which aimed at narrowing the gap in social and economic outcomes between the most deprived local areas and the rest of England.====The NRF involved the transfer of significant resources to local agencies as a way of enabling them to address the long-term social and economic problems in the most disadvantaged areas across England. It provided about £1.875 billion throughout the period 2001–2006 to deprived local areas, and a further £525 million for the year 2007/08 (Cowen et al., 2008). Local areas identified as being among the top 50 most deprived areas in England on any one of six key measures of deprivation were eligible for the NRF. On this basis, 81 out of 345 local areas across England received NRF funding, amounting to about £4 million per participating area per annum.====This paper focuses on crime reduction, one of the major goals of the NRF, for two key reasons. First, notwithstanding debates about the structural embeddedness and intractability of crime (Garland, 1996), the reduction of criminal activity is still regarded as a fundamental concern for government. Crime is among the most serious problems faced by neighbourhoods (Brooks, 2008). It is detrimental to economic prosperity, a significant drain on the public purse, harms the quality of life of victims (and perpetrators), and can instigate a vicious circle of social and economic decline in the communities in which it is most prevalent (Becker, 1968, Freeman, 1999). Second, crime is one of the few goals of the NRF for which measures were consistently recorded over time at the local area level for the period under study. Data on rates of burglary, vehicle crime, robbery, violence and sexual offences were published at the local level by the UK Home Office from 2000 onwards, and we are able to utilise these indicators to identify the effects of participation in the NRF.====Place-based policies generally seek to improve the quality of life for residents living in disadvantaged areas (Ladd, 1994). Initiatives intended to redevelop and regenerate distressed urban areas through co-ordinated action by multiple agencies have therefore focused on community as well as economic development (Neumark and Simpson, 2015). Prior research on multi-agency neighbourhood renewal programs shows that they can bring stakeholders together to generate better social and economic outcomes within disadvantaged areas (e.g., Roberts et al., 2017). However, systematic empirical research on the effectiveness of neighbourhood renewal programs is surprisingly scarce. Preliminary evaluations of the NRF suggested that it may have narrowed the “gap” between crime rates in the most deprived areas and the rest (see, Cowen et al., 2008, Amion Consulting 2010, Lupton et al., 2013). Nevertheless, these evaluations are based on descriptive or qualitative analysis, meaning that the findings should be treated with great caution. Robust empirical evidence on the impact of the NRF, would therefore cast valuable light on the relative merits of neighbourhood renewal programs more generally.====In this study, we estimate the impact of the NRF on crime by analysing the rates of property and violent crime across 345 local areas in England between 2000 and 2007 – during which time the NRF was implemented. To do so, we employ a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach to estimate the average effect of the NRF on crime rates, a continuous treatment variable strategy to account for potential differences in “treatment intensity”, and a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design to estimate the local effect of the NRF around the threshold for program eligibility.====Our DiD estimates suggest that the NRF lead to improved community safety in those disadvantaged areas benefitting from the additional resources allocated to them. Furthermore, the treatment intensity results indicate that the amount of NRF monies received by each local area is an important predictor of both property and violent crime rates, while RD estimates reveal that these positive effects are especially strong around the program eligibility threshold, particularly for property crime. The additional activities undertaken by local agencies in receipt of NRF funding may therefore have been responsible for the reductions in property crime that we observe and for preventing violent crime. The positive program effects that we identify are substantively important and are resistant to a number of robustness checks. Moreover, using a spatial DiD, we find evidence of the diffusion of crime prevention benefits from areas receiving NRF funding to neighbouring areas without funding. Hence, our estimates of the impact of the NRF on crime rates have the potential to contribute to debates about the effectiveness of neighbourhood renewal programs.====In the following section, we discuss the background to the NRF program. The subsequent section describes the empirical strategy that we employ, including information on the data, methods and estimators that comprise our research design. Thereafter, we present the results of the analyses that we undertake, before concluding with a discussion of the implications of the study.",Do neighbourhood renewal programs reduce crime rates?

The program was launched during the 2009-2010 school year and was expanded to 140 schools by 2015-16. We use data from more than 10 years of geocoded Chicago police reports and school level data to analyze the Safe Passage program's effects on crime rates and the rate of ,"Students routinely encounter a wide range of safety issues when commuting to and from schools across the country. According to Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, most (63%) violent crimes committed by juveniles occur on school days and nearly one-fifth (19%) of juvenile violent crimes occur in the 4 h between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. on school days. Additionally, the rate of victimization at schools is high, with 60.6% of nonfatal victimization for students aged 12–18 occurring at school in 2015 (National Crime Victimization Survey). Studies such as Mathews et al., 2009, Schwartz and Gorman, 2003, Grogger, 1997, and Billings and Phillips (2017) have found that exposure to crime, especially violent crime, may affect educational achievement, and implications for long-term outcomes have been established by Braga et al., 2012, Nagin, 2013, Lum and Koper, 2014, and Chalfin and McCrary (2017). Increasing public safety and crime prevention has long been at the center stage of policy debate. Previous empirical studies suggest that increasing or redeploying of police to specific geographic areas (or “hotspots”) is an effective means of reducing crime.==== However, most of these studies restrict their analysis to police enforcement practices, such as short term exogenous changes in the deployment of police following a terror attack (Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004, Klick and Tabarrok, 2005, Draca et al., 2011), or short term randomized experiments, such as “crackdowns” (Weisburd et al., 2009, Braga et al., 2012, Lum and Koper, 2014). Research on social interaction and safety suggests that community involvement can help reduce crime (Krivo, 2014).====This paper examines an alternative way of policing to increase student safety: hiring civilians to guard schools for a few hours each day. To study this alternative strategy, we use the Chicago Safe Passage program.  The program places civilian guards around schools during arrival and dismissal times. The Safe Passage program is jointly run by the Chicago Public School and the Chicago Police Department, along with community organizations. The Safe Passage program began with 35 schools in the 2009-2010 school year and has expanded to cover about 20% of Chicago public schools in the 2015-2016 school year. Safe Passage guards are expected to be knowledgeable of the community area they serve. The guards receive a background check and are trained on various de-escalation strategies and safety protocols. The guards patrol streets designated as “Safe Passage Routes” for approximately two and a half hours in morning and afternoon times when students commute to and from school. The guards wear neon jackets, and the designated routes have signs indicating that they are Safe Passage Routes.====Previous studies have criticized such “hot spot” policing because 1) any crime reduction may only be short term, and 2) there may be spatial spillovers to neighboring areas. We evaluate these two criticisms in the context of the Safe Passage Program. More specifically, we analyze the effectiveness of this alternative policing strategy in reducing crime, whether the effects are persistent, and whether the program leads to spatial spillover of crime.====The key challenge in estimating the effects of Safe Passages on crime is identifying the counterfactual scenario, i.e. what would have happened to crime if guards were not present? The exact location of these Safe Passage routes allows us to exploit variation in crime within adjacent small geographic areas. We combine detailed geo-located crime data with the location of guards and exploit the timing of the start of the program and the location of the guards to estimate the effect on crime. The exact start date of the program and the duty times of the Safe Passage guards allows us to control for preexisting differences.====Our results suggest that the presence of guards is effective at reducing crime in the surveilled areas, and that crime is not displaced to nearby areas. Guarded areas experience a significant reduction in crime as compared to neighboring areas, with the effect being strongest for violent crime at 14%. The effect is limited to the times of day when they are on duty. The sharpest reduction in violent crime is associated with early Safe Passage routes, while the expansion of the program is the time when property crime is reduced. Similar to results found in Sanfelice (2018), we find that the decline in crime is stronger for high schools as compared with elementary and middle schools.==== Moreover, our results are consistent with the finding that place-based initiatives do not generally lead to spatial displacement (Sorg et al., 2013), and in the relatively rare cases where displacement does occur the spillover effects are small (Guerette and Bowers, 2009).====An important difference between the policing variation studied in previous research and our context is that the presence of Safe Passage guards is more likely to be permanent rather than temporary. This feature allows us to compare the long and short term effects. Sherman (1990) shows that the effectiveness of initial crackdowns declines over time, i.e., an “initial deterrence decay” that he suggests is caused by criminals learning over time that they had overestimated the risk of being caught. Consistent with Sherman's (1990) theory of initial deterrence decay, Sorg et al. (2013) find evidence that deterrent effects of Philadelphia's Foot Patrol experiment slowed down over the course of the experimental period, with the effect fading to zero after foot patrolling had continued for 22 weeks. In contrast, we find that Chicago's Safe Passage program has had a persistent reduction in crime three years after the experiment began. We find that the effects are persistent over time and continue to lower crime throughout the implementation period. Schools that had the program for more than two school years show a significant reduction in crime, with an approximate 20% decline in violent crime.====In addition, we find improvements in attendance, with Safe Passage schools witnessing an annual rate of change in attendance of about 2.5 percentage points. To identify the effect of the Safe Passage guards on school attendance, we supplement our data with school level information. To address potential concerns of selection bias of the guarded schools, we use propensity score matching to find suitable controls. These results suggest that the presence of Safe Passage guards acts as a deterrent for criminals and helps to encourage students to attend schools more regularly, which also has an incapacitation effect. The Safe Passage program is a relatively cheap way of increasing safety.====Our results suggest that placing civilian guards around schools is both an inexpensive and effective way of increasing safety and attendance. Safe Passage guards work at an hourly wage of $10 for about 5 h a day on weekdays when schools are in session, which is a significant savings relative to the costs of training or redeploying additional police officers. Moreover, the program provides an interesting insight into policies aimed at reducing crime. While the program directly deters crime, it also increases the probability that students will attend school, which in turn reduces the number of potential perpetrators of the crimes. This reduction in the number of potential perpetrators is a form of “self-incapacitation”: time spent in school is time not spent in criminal activities (Tauchen et al., 1994, Jacob and Lefgren, 2003, Luallen, 2006, Machin et al., 2011). The presence of guards will also produce quicker police response times, which is likely to increase the likelihood of arrests and eventual incarceration (Blanes I Vidal and Kirchmaier, 2017).====The guards are not equivalent to police, and they do not have the tools or training to incapacitate criminals. However, they do have the ability to intervene to defuse potential incidents, call 911, or simply make their presence known. Thus, our paper provides evidence of the effectiveness of an alternative policing strategy in which civilians are used for patrolling instead of police officers, and our findings can help guide policy makers around the country who have adopted or are considering adopting similar programs.==== Our study is also relevant to the broader literature on private policing, and more specifically on the literature showing that university policing has the potential to significantly reduce crime rates (e.g., MacDonald et al., 2016 and Heaton et al., 2016).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide background information on the Chicago Safe Passage program. Next, Section 3 presents our main results, including the effect of Safe Passage guards on crime and a cost-benefit analysis.

Using this framework, we find that marginal willingness-to-pay to avoid violent crime increases by sixteen cents with each additional incident per 100,000 residents. Accounting for the slope of the marginal willingness-to-pay function has significant impacts on welfare analyses.","Dating back to the work of Court (1939); Griliches (1961), and Lancaster (1966), hedonic techniques have been used to estimate the implicit prices associated with the attributes of differentiated products. The seminal work of Rosen (1974) proposed a theoretical structure for the hedonic regression and a two-stage procedure for the recovery of marginal willingness-to-pay (MWTP) functions for the characteristics of differentiated products. Importantly, his two-stage approach allowed households’ heterogenous MWTPs to be functions of the quantities of the product attribute that they consume.==== This is particularly important when considering non-marginal policy changes (i.e., any change that is large enough to alter the household’s willingness to pay at the margin). The two-stage procedure suggested by Rosen (and further developed by subsequent authors) uses variation in implicit prices (obtained either by employing data from multiple markets or by allowing for non-linearity in the hedonic price function) to identify the MWTP function.====With Rosen (1974) as a backdrop, the property value hedonic model has become the workhorse for valuing local public goods and environmental amenities, despite a number of well-known and well-documented econometric problems.==== An important problem arises in the second stage of Rosen’s two-step procedure. In separate papers, Bartik (1987) and Epple (1987) describe a source of endogeneity that is difficult to overcome using standard exclusion restriction arguments. Specifically, they note that the unobserved determinants of tastes affect both the quantity of an amenity that a household consumes and the hedonic price of the amenity. In a regression like the one described in the second stage of Rosen’s two-step procedure, the quantity of the amenity that a household consumes will therefore be endogenous. Moreover, because of the equilibrium features of the hedonic model, there are very few natural exclusion restrictions that one can use to solve this endogeneity problem.==== With a few exceptions, the hedonics literature has subsequently ignored Rosen’s second stage, focusing instead on recovering estimates of the hedonic price function and valuing only marginal changes in amenities.====Various instrumental variables strategies have been proposed to deal with this problem. Epple (1987) provides a set of order conditions that describe a valid set of instruments. Bartik (1987) suggests instrumenting for the quantity of an amenity that a household consumes with market indicator variables and Kahn and Lang (1988) suggest a similar instrument of market indicators interacted with household demographic attributes. The intuition for these strategies is that differences in the distribution of suppliers across markets will provide an exogenous source of variation in the equilibrium quantity of the amenity chosen by each household. The concern with these approaches is that they require strong assumptions about cross-market preference homogeneity and the instrument may not induce sufficient variation in the endogenous variable. Ekeland et al. (2004) takes advantage of the non-linearity of the hedonic model to propose an alternative instrumental-variables strategy which does not require assumptions about cross-market preference homogeneity and may be used in a single-market setting.====In this paper, we describe a simple estimation procedure for the recovery of the marginal willingness-to-pay function. Our parametric approach employs insights from the non-parametric estimators developed in Ekeland et al. (2004) and Heckman et al. (2005) and makes explicit the relationship between the quantity of the amenity being consumed and the attributes of the households doing the consumption. That such a relationship should exist in hedonic equilibrium goes back to the idea of “stratification” found in Ellickson (1971), which became the basis for estimable Tiebout sorting models.====. This approach works even in a single-market setting, given a flexible representation of the hedonic price function. Moreover, the approach is computationally simple and does not require any more in terms of data or assumptions than does the standard Rosen-style approach.====We implement this estimation procedure using data on large changes in violent crime rates in the San Francisco Bay Area over the period 1994 to 2000. We find that recovering the full MWTP function is economically important; a household’s marginal willingness to pay to avoid an incident of violent crime (measured by cases per 100,000 residents) increases by sixteen cents with each additional incident. Non-marginal reductions in crime of the sort seen in San Francisco and the rest of the nation during the 1990s therefore have the potential to significantly affect MWTP. We find that naive estimation approaches, which ignore this effect, yield estimates of total willingness to pay for crime reductions in San Francisco that are significantly biased. The naive models overestimate the willingness to pay for a crime reduction and underestimate the willingness to pay to avoid a crime increase. Similar problems are likely to arise in other settings where policy changes are not marginal (e.g., air quality, school reform, and hazardous waste site remediation).====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the estimation of the model in detail. Section 3 describes the data used in our application: housing transactions data from the San Francisco Bay Area combined with violent and property crime data from the RAND California Database. Section 4 reports the results of applying this estimation approach to these data. Section 5 calculates the welfare effects from the actual non-marginal changes in crime faced by a subset of homeowners and compares these welfare effects with those calculated with some alternative procedures in the existing literature.

From 1990 to 2015, the share of greenhouse gas emissions from transport has increased from 15 percent to 26 percent in Europe and from 23% to 27% in the United States (EEA, 2017, EPA, 2017). With continued declines in the cost of renewables and continued decarbonization of the electricity sector, this trend is likely to continue and perhaps even accelerate. Thus, policymakers worldwide have become increasingly attentive to the transport sector. Economists are uniformly in support of pricing greenhouse gases as the first-best approach to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, political acceptance of pricing policies is often hampered by concerns about the distributional effects of such policies, and this is especially true for pricing transportation fuel consumption (Borenstein, 2017). A common concern is that pricing policies will disproportionately affect a subset of households, such as less-wealthy households outside of urban areas.====This study uses millions of vehicle-level odometer readings matched to individual-level demographic information from the Danish registers to ask several questions. How do households across the population change their driving in response to fuel price changes? How is this response influenced by access to public transport? And what does the heterogeneity in response mean for the distributional effects of fuel price changes? We uncover a new finding to the literature: two groups of households who are much more responsive to changing fuel prices than most of the population. These households are in the ==== of the work distance distribution; one group has the longest commutes and the other commutes very little. Our mean medium-run (one-year) elasticity estimate of −0.30 is considerably influenced by these two groups of tail households, each of which are much more elastic. These findings can be rationalized by switching costs incurred when substituting from driving to other modes of transport, such as public transport, and we estimate the causal effect of public transport on driving responsiveness. Danes have almost universal access to public transport and we posit that our results hold in similar settings around the world.====Our results have direct policy implications. By uncovering the economic mechanisms at work in the driving elasticity, we show that the two groups of tail households face substantially reduced impacts from fuel price increases. This is especially important because the roughly 15% of the population in the upper tail–households with the longest commutes–face a heavy burden from fuel price increases and thus may be more opposed to pricing greenhouse gases. This is a politically salient point in Denmark as the Danish government pays particularly close attention to rural voters who tend to have longer commutes. As was noted by Prime Minister Rasmussen, the Danish government is even going as far as moving 3900 governmental jobs to outside the capital region at a cost of over 400 million DKK ($61 million at the July 9, 2017 exchange rate).==== These issues are by no means isolated to Denmark, with the impact on groups of voters outside of cities playing a key role in policy debates about pricing greenhouse gases throughout the developed world.====Indeed, our findings also have implications for other countries where access to public transport is less universal. Our results suggest that access to public transport is a prerequisite for the existence of the upper tail. Without adequate access to public transport, households with long commutes are less able to substitute away from driving when fuel prices rise. Intuitively, previous work from countries with more limited access to public transport, such as the United States, show no evidence of the upper tail of responsiveness from households with longer commutes. Such previous work does however routinely find that households in cities (who would be expected to have shorter commutes) tend to be more responsive (e.g., Kayser, 2000, Gillingham, 2013, Gillingham, 2014, Gillingham, Jenn, Azevedo, 2015), consistent with our lower tail, which we show is also primarily driven by households in the cities in Denmark. By identifying the upper tail in the work distance distribution in Denmark, we show that there is a group of more-responsive households in Europe that is not likely to exist in countries like the United States where public transport provision is lower. This directly impacts the effectiveness of fuel pricing in reducing driving and emissions and may crucially affect the political acceptability of pricing greenhouse gases.====This research contributes to several strands of literature. First, there is a growing literature on the distributional effects of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Economists have worked on this issue for decades, primarily focusing on the vertical distributional effects (i.e., distributional effects over income) of gasoline taxes (Poterba, 1989, Poterba, 1991). More recently, Borenstein and Davis (2016) estimate the distributional effects of U.S. Clean Energy Tax Credits (including subsidies for hybrid and electric vehicles) and find them to be quite regressive. Levinson (2016); Jacobsen (2013), and Davis and Knittel (2016) compare the vertical distributional impacts of fuel economy standards to gasoline taxes in the United States, generally finding that fuel economy standards are more regressive than gasoline taxes.==== There is much less work on geographic distributional consequences, despite the importance for policy. Bento et al. (2009) use survey data to estimate the efficiency and distributional consequences of gasoline taxes across states in the United States and show that households in more rural states face a much higher burden. Our study is the first to identify the two tails of more responsive drivers, link them to geographic location, shed light on the mechanisms creating them, and show how they influence the short-run distributional effects of policies affecting fuel prices.====This study also uses rich data to provide a new point estimate for the fuel price elasticity of driving, which is a dominant component in the modeling of gasoline or diesel demand. Understanding the responsiveness to fuel prices is a first-order question in economics. Not only is it valuable for anticipating responses to future swings in oil prices, it is also useful for measuring the macroeconomic effects of oil price fluctuations (e.g., Edelstein and Kilian, 2009) and providing insight into the role of speculators during oil price shocks (Hamilton, 2009). Not surprisingly, there is a vast literature aiming to estimate the price elasticity of gasoline demand (e.g., for some recent studies see Coglianese, Davis, Kilian, Stock, 2016, Davis, Kilian, 2011, Hughes, Knittel, Sperling, 2008, Li, Linn, Muehlegger, 2014, Hymel, Small, 2015, Small, van Dender, 2007, Levin, Lewis, Wolak, 2017). Most of these studies use aggregate data at the regional or national level.==== More recently, several studies have estimated the elasticity of vehicle-miles-traveled with respect to the price of gasoline using disaggregated micro-level data, either from surveys or inspection odometer reading data (e.g., Linn, 2016, Bento, Goulder, Jacobsen, von Haefen, 2009, Gillingham, 2013, Gillingham, 2014, Munk-Nielsen, 2015, De Borger, Mulalic, Rouwendal, 2016a, Knittel, Sandler, 2018). In a notable contrast, estimates for drivers in the United States tend to be in the range of −0.05 to −0.30, while similar benchmark estimates for European drivers tend to show a much more elastic response. For example, Frondel and Vance (2013) estimate a medium-run driving elasticity with respect to the gasoline price of −0.45 in Germany.==== Similarly, in contemporaneous work, De Borger et al. (2016b) focus on a subsample of two-vehicle households in Denmark and find the medium-run fuel price elasticity of driving to range between −0.32 and −0.45. We demonstrate how the removal of the upper tail–or the removal of adequate access to public transport–can reconcile these differing estimates between the United States and Europe.====Our results also contribute to a third vein of literature on the complex relationships between household location, public transport availability, gasoline prices, and consumer decisions about how much to drive. Since at least McFadden, (1974), it has long been recognized that access to public transport is an important mediator of travel choices, with clear environmental implications (e.g., Glaeser and Kahn, 2010). Our work contributes to this literature by using an instrumental variables strategy to identify the causal effect of public transport on the responsiveness of driving to fuel price changes. Further, there is growing evidence that urban form and the spatial structure of commuting demand can affect travel mode choices (Bento, Cropper, Mobarak, Vinha, 2005, Grazi, van den Bergh, van Ommeren, 2008, Brownstone, Golob, 2010). Our paper follows the literature estimating short-run and medium-run driving elasticities by holding the household location fixed, but shows how long-run equilibrium commute distances influence the short-run response to fuel prices.==== These results are important for land use and transport policy, as they clarify the implications of policies that encourage shorter commute times (e.g., some smart growth policies) or greater access to public transport.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the rich Danish register data and provides descriptive evidence on the primary features of the data relevant to estimating the driving responsiveness. Section 3 describes our empirical strategy, while Section 4 presents the results and a set of robustness checks. Section 5 discusses implications for policy, including an illustrative distributional effects analysis.

The reorganisation induced pupils to remain in small local schools throughout grades 1–9, as opposed to making a transition to large middle schools between grades 6 and 7. The reorganisation had large consequences for pupils’ environments in the affected areas: travel distances to school decreased as well as the school cohort size; the composition of peers became more homogenous; and notably we find a reduction in teacher qualifications and experience. Despite that the previous literature has found that school transitions, school size and teacher experience are important inputs in the education production function, we find no evidence that remaining in a small local school had effects on educational outcomes. We reconcile our evidence using a survey which reveals that Swedish pupils do not perceive large differences in the psychosocial learning environment between schools of different grade configurations. Our results are important in informing policy makers and urban planners of the costs and benefits of different types of school organisations.","The question of how pupils are grouped at school has received a lot of attention both in policy making and in education research. Examples include the shift from selective to comprehensive school systems, the use of ability tracking, the nature of peer effects, and class size. One yet scarcely examined topic within this field is the organisation of schools into units of different grade spans and size within school districts. The relatively little research on this matter is surprising as it has been an important policy issue for a long time. For example, policy makers in many cities face the decision of whether to organise public middle and high schools into central units with large catchment areas, or to decentralize by expanding local primary schools to include also higher grades. It is only recently that the economics literature has started to address whether school size and grade configuration are important in the education production function. If these aspects of how a school is organised are important for pupil outcomes, school reorganisation might constitute an effective means to improve pupil performance at a potentially low cost.====This paper evaluates a reorganisation of Swedish middle school education which took place in the mid-1990s after the passing of a new national curriculum. Many feeder schools that had previously covered grades 1–6, came to expand and include also middle school grades 7–9. This grade reconfiguration implied that pupils who would otherwise have had to transition to a new school between grades 6 and 7, remained in the same school throughout compulsory education. Our aim is to shed light on the effects of organising schooling in grade 1–9 schools as opposed to configurations that require school transitions. This policy may affect pupils’ school environment and families’ welfare by inducing pupils to remain in smaller and more homogenous schools closer to home. It may also have consequences for the efficiency in the use of teacher resources across schools. And ultimately, it may affect pupils’ educational attainment. It is important to understand the broad spectrum of potential effects, since policy makers and urban planners make constrained decisions, facing costs and revenues associated with different types of school organisation.====To study the effects of grade configuration in the Swedish context, we identify pupils that were exposed to an organisational change: treated pupils lived in neighbourhoods where the default school was a primary feeder school (grade 1–6) that expanded to cover all grades 1–9, and as such pupils were induced to stay in a 1–9 school rather than transitioning to a different school in grade 7. We adopt a staggered difference-in-differences strategy, where pupils belonging to treated neighbourhoods are compared to pupils living in untreated neighbourhoods or in neighbourhoods where treatment occurred at a different point in time.====The identification is based on the assumption that untreated neighbourhoods can accurately represent the trend in treated neighbourhoods in the absence of any intervention. This assumption is not testable, but we present event study-graphs that show parallel trends in the period before the intervention was introduced. To alleviate remaining concerns that treatment is correlated with unobserved neighbourhood-specific trends we also complement all main analyses with regressions where we (1) include sibling-fixed effects and (2) identify the effect solely off of the timing of reorganisation within affected areas. The point estimates from the two latter identification strategies are overall very similar to the results from our baseline model.====We show that the reorganisation had large consequences for both the social and learning environment for treated pupils. Exposure to treatment reduced the probability of pupils transitioning to a grade 7–9 middle school by 76% and resulted in a reduction in the peer cohort size in the school of more than one full class (33 pupils). In addition, it reduced travel distance to school by 2 km, and it resulted in more homogenous peer groups. Moreover, we find that pupils exposed to an expanding school had teachers with lower qualifications and experience. Interestingly, our results clearly indicate that school reorganisation comes at a cost of inferior teacher resources at “new” units, but also show that some of the negative effects fade out with time: after four years the expanding schools had been able to catch up with other schools in terms of teacher qualifications, but still had teachers with substantially lower experience.====However, we find no evidence that these changes in the pupils’ school environment carry over into effects on their performance in the education system. The effects on GPA, high school graduation and university attendance are close to zero and in most cases precisely estimated. The absence of effects on educational outcomes should not be attributed to the initial start-up phase of a new school, as we can show that the effects are stable around zero up to four years after the school reorganised. We corroborate our findings using a pupil survey which shows no differences in terms of the psychosocial learning environment in schools of different grade configurations and of different size.====Our results on pupil performance contrast previous research from the US that has found that remaining in a K–8 school (Rockoff and Lockwood, 2010, Schwerdt and West, 2012), and attending small high schools (Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2013, Schwartz et al., 2013, Bloom and Unterman, 2014, Barrow et al., 2015), have positive effects on pupils’ outcomes. Rockoff and Lockwood (2010) and Schwerdt and West (2012) find that this positive effect is particularly pronounced for disadvantaged children, and the evidence from small high schools also comes from primarily disadvantaged and minority pupils. These papers suggest that school environment and early transitions are the key mechanisms behind the results.==== More generally, middle schools typically have several parallel classes in each grade and hence larger cohort sizes compared to local schools that cover all grades (e.g. K–8 in the US, 1–9 in Sweden). Adolescents may be difficult to educate in a school with many peers of the same age (Rockoff and Lockwood, 2010), e.g. through difficulties in preventing anti-social behaviour in schools with large numbers of teenagers. It is also possible that a move to a new school itself has detrimental effects on performance (Hanushek et al., 2004), especially for young adolescents whose behaviour and self-image may be negatively affected by moving to a middle or junior high school (Steinberg, 2011).====Although most of this discussion points to negative effects of organizing schools in a manner that implies a transition to large middle schools, there might also be effects going in the opposite direction. For example, large middle schools that serve many neighbourhoods typically have a more mixed pupil composition than local schools. Depending on the nature of peer effects, this may or may not have consequences for pupil performance. Furthermore, cohort size in itself might have implications for the efficiency of resource allocation. If economies of scale are important in education production, larger cohort sizes and/or larger schools should be more efficient.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides background to the reorganisation of Swedish schools; Section 3 introduces the data and descriptive statistics; Section 4 presents the empirical model and the main results; and Section 5 concludes.

Dutch administrative monthly data were used and analysed with a quasi-experimental design involving job displacement. The estimates show that displaced workers, relative to comparable non-displaced workers, experience besides substantial losses in employment and wages also large increases in the ","As in many other countries, the Dutch owner-occupied housing market and labour market suffered from strong negative developments during the Great Recession that started in 2008 (OECD, 2010).==== The large scale at which the transaction prices and home property values fell in the Dutch owner-occupied housing market is very rare – it previously occurred in the period 1978 to 1982. The central question we address is how workers adjust after job displacement, by focusing on margins of adjustment that are related to space and the importance of workers’ housing state.==== A better understanding of the use of margins of adjustment by displaced workers is relevant for government policies that aim to limit the impact of negative employment shocks (Crépon and Van den Berg, 2016) and policies that affect housing state choice through subsidising homeownership or stimulating mortgage debt (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999).====Our first aim is to examine whether the spatial structure of homes and jobs represents relevant margins of adjustment for displaced workers. The literature on job displacement argues, based on human capital theory, that displaced workers lose human capital and wage premiums, and consequently experience substantial losses in post-displacement employment and wage outcomes (Hamermesh, 1987, Topel, 1990, Jacobson, LaLonde, Sullivan, 1993). The focus on losses in human capital, however, ignores the way displaced workers could use margins of adjustment related to space such as commuting patterns and household relocations to different homes, which are key to employment outcomes and wage dispersion.==== Indeed, Huttunen et al. (2018) show that job displacement increases household relocations to different homes, and argue that the losses in employment and income are highest for displaced workers who change home. Hence, Huttunen et al. (2018) suggest that displaced workers change home for non-economic reasons such as family ties. We would argue that the commuting distance, compared to changing home, is a more relevant margin of labour adjustment for displaced workers, as displacement generates a negative income shock that lowers individuals’ ability to change home. To better understand the use of margins of adjustment by displaced workers, we assess the displacement effects on employment, wages, commuting distance and changing home.====Our second aim is to examine the importance of workers’ housing state for the displacement effects on employment, wages, commuting and changing home. The impact of workers’ housing state on employment is theoretically ambiguous. On the one hand, homeowners relative to tenants, and mortgage owners relative to outright owners (i.e. owners who have paid off their entire mortgage), are less able to change home because of higher transaction costs and a more severe equity constraint (Stein, 1995, Chan, 2001, Ferreira, Gyourko, Tracy, 2010, Andersson, Mayock, 2014).==== This geographic immobility could hinder employment prospects. On the other, homeowners, relative to tenants, may search more efficiently for jobs due to the use of more effective search methods (Goss, Phillips, 1997, Morescalchi, 2016). Moreover, mortgage owners, relative to outright owners, search more intensively for jobs due to differences in housing costs and payment obligations. In turn, the higher search efficiency or intensity could increase employment prospects. The difference in the exit rate into employment among displaced workers who differ in homeownership and home equity can thus be explained by differences in geographic mobility, search efficiency and search intensity. An alternative hypothesis is that unemployed workers who are highly leveraged and face a home equity constraint are more willing to accept a larger wage loss or a job that is further away. For example, Brown and Matsa (2017) show that unemployed workers who experience a home equity constraint are more willing to apply for positions that are closer in distance but pay lower wages. Ultimately, it is an empirical question how the worker’s housing state affects the use of the margins of adjustment following job displacement.====For our empirical analysis, we created a monthly panel of employees based on rich administrative data sets that contain Dutch data of firms, employees and households in the period from January 2006 to December 2014. This time period is particularly suited as it includes the Great Recession and thereby allows us to incorporate data on the declining property values of homes and increasing number of bankruptcies of firms. We used data on job displacement due to firm bankruptcies (hereafter: job displacement) as an exogenous negative shock to the employment status of workers. The data on job displacement set the stage for a quasi-experimental design. This empirical design is important, since we examine incentive effects of workers’ housing state in which endogenous selection into labour turnover should play no role. However, there could exist confounding factors that affect the probability of job displacement. The potential of selection into job displacement based on observables was minimised by exact matching on coarsened observables of treated (displaced) to similar control (non-displaced) workers (Iacus et al., 2011). We included individual-specific fixed effects and applied the double-differences (DD) and triple-differences (DDD) estimator to control for various sources of unobserved heterogeneity.====The displaced and matched non-displaced workers are followed for eighteen months prior until thirty-six months after job displacement. The framework of the DD estimator was applied to the coarsened exact matched sample to estimate the displacement effects. The displacement effects are inferred from reduced-form models on four margins of adjustment, i.e. changes in employment, hourly wage, commuting distance and changing home. The DDD estimator was applied to assess the role of workers’ housing state in the effects of job displacement. Workers’ housing state was categorised by tenancy and homeownership, where owners were classified in five groups based on their loan-to-value ratio (hereafter: LTV) that was expressed as a percentage.====Our analysis provides two sets of novel results. First, the estimates show that commuting and household relocations to a different home are significant margins of adjustment in response to job displacement. Specifically, the average displacement effects we estimated show that displaced workers during the post-displacement period of thirty-six months, on average, (i) are about 25 percentage points less employed, (ii) experience a loss in wage of 6 per cent, (iii) experience an increase in the commuting distance of 3 km and (iv) have a 0.06 percentage points lower probability of changing home. The displacement effects on employment and wage are consistent with those reported in the job displacement literature for European countries (e.g., see Schwerdt, 2011, Huttunen, Møen, Salvanes, 2011, Ichino, Schwerdt, Winter-Ebmer, Zweimüller, 2017). A novel finding of this paper is the increase in the commuting distance and decrease in changing home for workers who have been displaced, which represent compared to the mean value about a 20 per cent and 14 per cent change, respectively. This finding suggests that for displaced workers commuting is a more relevant margin of adjustment for economic reasons, whereas changing home might be more relevant for family reasons (Huttunen et al., 2018).==== Also, the results reveal an interesting pattern over time since job displacement: the negative displacement effect on wages becomes more pronounced, whereas the positive effect on commuting distance becomes smaller. The first contribution of this paper is to document the spatial response to job displacement, which suggests that commuting is a more relevant margin of labour adjustment than changing home and that workers who are longer unemployed prefer working closer to home over higher wages.====Second, we find that workers’ housing state plays a significant role in the displacement effects on employment, wages and the commuting distance, but not on the probability of changing home. We are not the first to examine the role of workers’ housing state in employment outcomes.==== However, the literature ignores various selection problems that arise due to the correlations among workers’ exit rate into unemployment, cause of unemployment and housing state choice.==== We contribute to this literature by exploiting a quasi-experimental design involving job displacement that eliminates the potential of endogenous selection into labour turnover. We find that displaced underwater owners (i.e. owners who face negative home equity), relative to displaced tenants, experience a 7 percentage points lower loss in employment. From the group of displaced homeowners, outright owners experience the highest loss in employment. Also, the results suggest that displaced tenants are more selective in post-displacement wages, and highly leveraged owners become employed relatively close to home. Displaced outright owners experience the highest increase in the commuting distance. The second contribution is to show that the effect of workers’ housing state on the post-displacement outcomes in employment, wages and commute is substantial, and comparable in magnitude to that of other relevant characteristics such as gender and sector.",The role of the housing market in workers′ resilience to job displacement after firm bankruptcy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119018300925,January 2019,2019,Research Article,165.0

Increasing returns were also key for the development of the new economic geography, the micro-foundations for urban agglomerations and the new trade theory with heterogeneous firms.==== Comparative advantage is back, however, and, possibly surprisingly, no one has articulated this more powerfully than Krugman (2009) whilst reflecting in his Nobel Prize Lecture on the increasing returns revolution in trade and geography. Empirically his judgement is impressively backed by the explosion of trade between advanced economies and much poorer low-wage economies, notably China, in the last 15 years (e.g. Autor et al., 2013). Comparative advantage has recently experienced very strong renewed interest also from a theoretical point of view.====This paper contributes to the theoretical research which explores the interface between comparative advantage and increasing returns. We show that their interaction yields new insights which transcend what one would expect from the sum of their parts. A simple stylized model is proposed which examines the two drivers and which highlights costly trade of both intermediate and final goods and Services.==== The key insight that we develop is that the interaction between comparative advantage and agglomeration economies involves a fundamental tension which is in different ways affected by trade costs. Both comparative advantage and agglomeration economies associated with increasing returns become more powerful when trade costs are lower. Yet, comparative advantage is a dispersive force whilst increasing returns are an agglomerative force. This insight has far-reaching implications for international trade and the location of economic activity as we now explain in turn.====A basic implication of the model for international trade is that the relative wage between large and small countries is shaped by the tension between the primitive parameters representing increasing returns and comparative advantage: agglomeration economies push up the relative wage of the larger economy, whilst comparative advantage works against this through the terms of trade. Although this first insight might quite naturally be expected from a model which combines the two ingredients, it has not yet been recognized how this tension is powerfully, and in a different way, affected by trade costs, a key contribution of our analysis. More specifically, a secular fall in these costs is more likely to raise the wage of a large economy vis-à-vis a smaller trading partner the less it occurs in sectors governed by comparative advantage and the more it takes place in increasing returns sectors.====Referring to the interaction of comparative advantage and increasing returns our analysis thus helps to rationalize why wages of advanced economies of considerably different size, yet similar technology levels, such as Germany and Belgium, are within the same range, a finding that can neither be explained by a purely traditional trade model nor a purely new trade model. Moreover, the interplay between comparative advantage and agglomeration economies also provides an explanation as to why it is empirically so difficult to identify the home market effect of new trade theory. Our analysis also speaks to issues in a North-South trade context where population differences (e.g. China, India versus OECD-countries) are particularly acute. Apart from the mentioned effects related with these size differences, our model allows us to highlight the implications of the flattening of comparative advantage induced by the rapid transmission of knowledge and the convergence of institutions that has been observed: ever smaller cost (wage) differences suffice for a relocation of industries and the pressure on the relative wage of large economies is reduced when comparative advantage thins out.====We also apply our model to the context of economic geography where labor is assumed to be mobile across locations. This yields further intriguing insights. One key novel result is that the impact of a reduction of trade costs on the location of industries is far more complex than implied by the new trade theory and the new economic geography. We show that it depends on the different effect that trade costs have in sectors governed by comparative advantage as compared with sectors governed by increasing returns. More specifically, partial agglomeration emerges endogenously when agglomeration economies are strong relative to comparative advantage and this is more likely the lower trade costs are in increasing returns industries and the higher trade costs are in industries governed by comparative advantage. Another intriguing prediction of our model is that a flattening of comparative advantage fosters agglomerative tendencies. To exemplify this, one can observe the case of the European Union where the integration process over the past decades led to a convergence of institutions. Our analysis suggests that the associated flattening of comparative advantage may have contributed to the concentration of economic activity that has taken place in Europe (e.g. Combes and Overman, 2004, Midelfart-Knarvik and Overman, 2002). This channel is novel, extant research has predominantly focused on the effect of reduced trade costs.====A further important implication of our model in the context of economic geography is that the endogenously emerging larger location is active in sectors governed by increasing returns as well as in sectors where comparative advantage prevails. The core exhibits more diversity in production than the emerging periphery, which is only active in the sector governed by comparative advantage. Hence, if we interpret the two locations as cities, our framework provides a theoretical foundation for an endogenously emerging urban system where large cities are more diversified than small ones, a key empirical fact which is well-documented in urban economics (Duranton and Puga, 2000).====In order to work out the interaction between comparative advantage and agglomeration economies and the differential effects of trade costs we integrate the Ricardian model of Dornbusch et al. (1977) with the input sharing mechanism of Ethier (1982). This yields a tractable framework with a small set of parameters. Specifically, we use a parameterized version of the Dornbusch et al. (1977) model which makes use of the probabilistic representation of technologies from Eaton and Kortum (2002). In the setting with two locations this implies a simple specification for the chain of comparative advantage in the production of final goods and services. The production of these final outputs is assumed to use both labor and a CES-bundle of intermediate goods and services. The latter are produced under increasing returns by monopolistically competitive firms as in Ethier (1982). This introduces agglomeration economies based on linkages between intermediate suppliers and final output producers as in a canonical model of urban and regional economics (Abdel-Rahman and Fujita, 1990, Duranton and Puga, 2014). Our two choices grant modeling ease but are also quite natural. First, comparative advantage and perfect competition are basically ‘twins’ in classical trade theory. Second, even though increasing returns could be captured by other mechanisms rather than input sharing, focusing on input-output linkages has the merit that it allows us to keep track of the increasing tradability of intermediates.==== Furthermore in practice, as argued by Ethier (1982), the sharing of intermediate inputs may be more important than love of variety on the part of consumers.====We should like to point out that, even though we use a specific framework to work out the interplay between comparative advantage and increasing returns, ==== that there is no reason to believe that it should not apply in any other model jointly exhibiting comparative advantage and increasing returns.","Comparative advantage, agglomeration economies and trade costs",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119018300901,January 2019,2019,Research Article,166.0

Within- and across-city decreasing returns to scale cause agents to perceive their city as being too large in the socially optimal allocation. As a consequence, in equilibrium the largest cities on the most amenable sites are undersized, whereas the smaller cities on less amenable sites are oversized. We propose a test for optimal city size with heterogeneous sites extending the Henry George Theorem.",None,The optimal distribution of population across cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009411901830069X,March 2019,2019,Research Article,167.0
