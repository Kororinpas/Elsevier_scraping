We assessed health using frailty, the vulnerability to poor recovery after a physiologic stressor. We created a frailty index with data from three health and retirement surveys: the Brazilian ","The number and proportion of older adults are increasing in populations across the globe. The number of people aged 65 years and older is expected to double from 700 million in 2020 to 1.5 billion by 2050. (United Nations, 2022) Proportionally, one in six individuals will be older adults, aged at least 65 years, by 2050. While population aging has long been recognized as a priority for high-income countries, it is now a growing concern for low- and middle-income countries. Indeed, the pace of population aging in these countries is faster than expected. Kinsella and Phillips (2005) In Brazil, India, and China, where around 38 % of the world’s population resides, the demographic transitions due to low fertility and mortality rates and increasing life expectancy have substantially changed population structures. (United Nations, 2022) In 2020, the proportions of the populations of Brazil, India, and China that were over the age of 65 were 10 %, 7 %, and 12 %, respectively, and are expected to more than double to 23 %, 14 %, and 26 % by 2050. United Nations (2022).====However, defining population aging based on chronological age alone is insufficient. Older individuals vary substantially in health, cognitive, and functional status; understanding how these domains differ across countries is important for comprehending the actual implications of their aging populations. Frailty, defined as the loss of the ability to recover from physiologic stress, provides one framework for comparing aging populations based on these domains. The two major frameworks for assessing frailty—as a discrete phenotype of loss of muscle mass and inactivity or as a continuous measure of accumulated health and functional deficits—are both associated with multiple adverse health outcomes and mortality. (Fried, 2001, Rockwood, 2004, Song et al., 2010) Clinically, frailty has been used to assess risks for medical procedures and treatment plans. At the population level, frailty assessments can inform policymakers of the wellbeing of older adults to craft targeted health and social welfare policies.====Most work to date on frailty and social determinants of health has focused on high-income countries. (Collard et al., 2012) A study using data from 15 European countries found macroeconomic gradients in frailty, with a lower mean frailty index in relatively higher-income countries in northern and western Europe than in countries in southern and eastern Europe. Theou et al., 2013 Using a frailty index, another analysis of this cohort found that lower education, wealth, and occupational class were associated with higher frailty and progression. (Stolz et al., 2017) Comparable results have been found in English and American cohorts. (Szanton et al., 2010, Niederstrasser et al., 2019).====However, similar research in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) populations has been limited. Previous studies and reviews that have looked at frailty and its association with socioeconomic variables in LMICs have been particularly limited by small sample sizes. (Nguyen et al., 2015, Hoogendijk et al., 2018, Chowdhary, 2020) Further, these studies were conducted in nonrepresentative samples, making it difficult to discuss implications for whole populations.====In this paper, we examine the burden of frailty using a frailty index in nationally representative cohorts from Brazil, India, and China. We also investigate the associations between individual socioeconomic measures and frailty in these populations.","Frailty and socioeconomic stratification in Brazil, India, and China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X23000178,15 April 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

We use variation in timing and presence of state-required personal finance coursework in high schools to estimate the effect of the financial education coursework on the likelihood of holding and amount in retirement accounts in adulthood (ages 25–40). Our results show no definitive increases in account ownership, non-retirement investment accounts, or homeownership. Since prior work finds required high school financial education improves credit and debt outcomes, we recommend that states and educators prioritize content that is more immediately relevant for 18-year-olds, such as budgeting, long-term debt, and credit.","The burden of planning and saving for retirement in the U.S. has shifted from largely being employer- and government-sponsored through a mix of Social Security and pensions to individuals’ own responsibility. Even though the responsibility has shifted to individuals, research suggests that financial literacy levels, particularly among the young, are extremely low (Lusardi et al., 2010). Individuals with higher levels of financial literacy are more likely to participate in the stock market (van Rooij et al., 2011a), plan for retirement (Alessie et al., 2011, Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007, van Rooij et al., 2011b, van Rooij et al., 2012), and possess the financial sophistication that leads to higher interest in savings account (Deuflhard et al., 2019, Lusardi et al., 2017). Since starting to save for retirement earlier has the potential to generate long-term gains, this begs the question: can financial literacy education during formative teenage years increase long-run retirement savings?====Research has documented that workplace financial education increases the likelihood and amount of retirement savings (e.g., Collins and Urban, 2016, Duflo and Saez, 2003, Kaiser et al., 2021).==== However, those workplace interventions happen once individuals are employed and are further into the lifecycle, and no previous research considers how required financial education in high school affects retirement planning.==== For younger adults, it is not clear that financial education will affect their long-run retirement savings, as they have conflicting priorities. A lifecycle model would predict that young adults should borrow to invest in their human capital and increase lifetime earnings. Young adults face many imminent financial challenges, such as borrowing for long-term expenses (e.g., higher education or an auto purchase), learning how to navigate the credit market, and managing a budget for the first time. If financial education covers retirement savings before addressing the basics, young people may end up saving early but then having to borrow from high-cost alternative financial services when a shock arises.====Regardless of the potential effects, policymakers often talk about improving retirement planning as one rationale for enacting these mandates. For example, in reference to the passage of Michigan’s 2022 financial literacy bill Anita Fox, the director of the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services, said in a statement: “You can’t start a family or start a business without thinking about financial services, including how to manage your money, how to take out a loan for a car or home, and how to save for retirement and the unexpected. This bill will help ensure our state gives students the foundation they need to achieve their personal and professional goals” (McCallen, 2022). Thus, it remains important to see if the policy has the intended effects.====Previous work shows that state-mandated financial education reduces non-student debt (Brown et al., 2016), improves credit scores (Brown et al., 2016, Urban et al., 2020, Urban, 2020), reduces delinquency (Brown et al., 2016, Urban et al., 2020, Urban, 2020), reduces alternative financial service use (Harvey, 2019), improves postsecondary financing behavior (Stoddard and Urban, 2020), increases liquid savings among those who never continue on to college (Harvey, 2020), and improves student loan repayment for first generation students (Mangrum, 2021). Thus, financial education may reduce the likelihood young adults get into financial trouble. This could then allow them to start retirement planning early, instead of being burdened with high-interest debt that necessitates immediate attention.====Required financial education in high school could also increase financial literacy, which then could result in additional retirement savings later in life. While research suggests that required financial education in high school improves outcomes related to debt and credit, research that estimates effects on financial literacy in adulthood fail to reject the null hypotheses of no effect (Burke et al., 2020, Mangrum, 2021).==== If financial education during teenage years does not affect measured financial literacy, it is not clear that the literature suggesting a link between financial literacy and retirement planning remains relevant (Alessie et al., 2011, Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007, van Rooij et al., 2011b, van Rooij et al., 2012). However, required financial education in high school could directly affect behaviors but does not affect measured financial literacy. This is consistent with findings in an experimental setting by Horn et al. (2020), as well as a financial education experiment that shows financial education improved inter-temporal decision-making among middle school students in Germany (Lührmann et al., 2018).====In this paper, we empirically test whether required high school financial education improves retirement savings for adults ages 25–40. Using variation in the timing and presence of state policies that require students to complete personal finance instruction prior to high school graduation, we estimate a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) difference-in-difference model to see if the education improves the likelihood of having a retirement account.====We use nationally representative data from the National Financial Capability Study’s (NFCS) 2012, 2015, and 2018 waves, as well as data that oversamples low-income individuals—the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). We consider how the financial education affects the likelihood of having a retirement account through an employer (e.g., a 401k), having a retirement account on their own (e.g., an IRA), and the likelihood of having other assets (e.g., a non-retirement investment account, owning a home). When using the NFCS, we will additionally consider outcomes that capture financial stress, financial hardship, and financial planning related to retirement savings. When using the SIPP, we additionally consider the specific amounts in retirement savings, as well as home equity, mortgage characteristics, and net worth.====Overall, we find that required financial education in high school has limited effects on downstream retirement accounts in the NFCS data. We find no evidence that the education improves the likelihood of having a retirement account, having a non-retirement savings account, or owning a home. We further see no clear evidence that financial education decreases stress around retirement savings, increases the likelihood of planning for retirement, or reduces the likelihood of borrowing from one’s retirement account. These results do not change much if we consider the important link between employment and retirement account ownership for the overall population.====In the SIPP—where, again, the survey over-samples low-income individuals—our results largely confirm the findings in from the NFCS: a lack of increase in account ownership or homeownership. We find some weak evidence that required financial education in high school increases the likelihood of having a retirement account outside of one’s employer, such as an IRA. While we also see some evidence that home equity values increase in an economically meaningful way, this result is not statistically different from zero. We explore mortgage borrowing as a plausible mechanism for the resultant home equity values and find that homeowners exposed to financial education in high school had lower monthly payments and lower principal balances owed, likely courtesy of lower interest rates or purchasing cheaper homes.====Taken together, our evidence from the NFCS and SIPP paired with the prior literature on mandates suggest that while early-life financial education has the potential to improve outcomes around credit and debt—two outcomes that have important long-term consequences—the gains to retirement savings are not as apparent. Thus, it might make more sense for time-constrained personal finance courses to focus more carefully on topics pertaining to budgeting, debt, and credit before moving to retirement savings. Additionally, a focus on researching financial topics may be more broadly used than something specific to retirement savings, particularly if the policies and tax structures around retirement savings vehicles are ripe to change for the future. Based on findings from prior literature, the workplace or tax time may be better suited to cover financial education related to retirement savings (Boyer et al., 2020, Collins and Urban, 2016, Duflo and Saez, 2003).",Does financial education affect retirement savings?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X23000063,13 February 2023,2023,Research Article,1.0

This study evaluates the influence of public pension entitlements on ==== ,"Household wealth is commonly defined as the total value of assets minus the total value of liabilities. Social security wealth is usually not included in the value of households’ assets. The first reason for the omission of social security wealth is usually the lack of data, and the second is its limited liquidity (OECD, 2013). Because for the majority of households public pension entitlements are the most valuable asset (Atkinson, 1983) researchers try to estimate their value and assess the impact of social security wealth on wealth distribution.====In this paper, we investigate the impact of social security wealth on wealth inequality in 19 EU member states. To achieve this aim, we use a novel dataset – the third wave of the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey, which provides internationally comparable data on household wealth. Our estimates of social security wealth are based on Eurostat's (2019) demographic forecast EUROPOP 2019. We also study the impact of social security wealth on cross-country wealth gaps.====Wolff & Marley (1989) investigate the evolution of wealth inequality in the US in the period 1922–1983 using various wealth concepts. They find that social security wealth significantly decreases wealth inequality. Social security wealth equalizes wealth distributions also in other countries (Dunn and Hoffman, 1983, Bönke et al., 2019; Shamsuddin, 2001; Mazzaferro & Toso, 2009; Roine and Waldenström, 2009, Maunu, 2010, Kuhn, 2020, Longmuir, 2021, Wroński, 2023, Wroński, 2021a, Jabłonowski, 2021, Jacobs et al., 2022, Knell and Koman, 2022). Sierminska and Wronski (2022) review literature on the impact of public pension entitlements on wealth inequality and conclude that the equalizing impact of the public pension system has been confirmed in 25 countries.====Although the equalizing impact of social security wealth on wealth distribution is commonly acknowledged, literature has two important limitations. Firstly, it covers almost exclusively developed economies, where social security systems are usually progressive. Secondly, the availability of cross-country studies is very low (e.g. Frick and Headey, 2009, Bönke et al., 2020, Cowell et al., 2017). Results of single-country studies are very difficult to compare because researchers use different data sources and adopt various methods to estimate the value of social security wealth. In this paper, we fill this gap by delivering comparable measures of social security wealth and its equalizing power in 19 EU economies.====The hypothesis that social security wealth may partly decrease cross-country wealth gaps and thus it should be taken into account in international wealth comparisons is widely accepted in literature (Cowell & Van Kerm, 2015; Cowell et al., 2017). However, because empirical evidence on the distribution of social security wealth is scarce, authors studying this issue mostly use macroeconomic indicators such as pension spending relative to GDP. Fessler & Schürz (2018) estimate multilevel cross-country regressions and find that the degree of welfare state spending across countries is negatively correlated with household net wealth. Their research is based on HFCS data for 13 countries. Skopek (2015) studies the impact of the public pension system in a sample of 40 countries and also the robust link between higher generosity of public pension systems and lower values of private wealth. Wroński (2021c) reviews literature on the substitution between social security wealth and private wealth.====We find that social security wealth significantly decreases wealth inequality in the European Union. However, there is great variation in the strength of the equalizing power of the public pension system. The impact of social security wealth on (augmented) wealth inequality is strongest in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Estonia, while it is lowest in Greece, Slovenia, and Luxembourg.====Countries where public pension systems mitigate wealth inequality to the greatest extent tend to have high private wealth inequality. Demography does not seem to significantly impact the equalizing power of public pension systems, at least in our case, in which the sample is composed only of those who already claim public pension benefits. The equalizing power of social security wealth is positively correlated with the social security wealth – private wealth ratio (which may be seen as a measure of the size of the public pension system) and the share of single households in the population. Higher homeownership and a stronger correlation between the position of the household in the distribution of private wealth and its position in the distribution of augmented wealth weaken the equalizing power of the public pension system.====Social security wealth does not invalidate the European wealth hierarchy. Western Europe is richer not only in private wealth terms, but also in social security wealth terms. Social security wealth lowers not only within-country wealth inequality but also wealth inequality in the whole European Union (19 countries in our sample taken together). On the other hand, however, Theil index decomposition shows that the augmented wealth inequality in the European Union is to a larger extent generated by between-country inequality than private wealth inequality.====The paper is structured as follows.

Once the difference-GMM addresses the potential endogeneity issue, we find no association between the shares of both young and older workers and firms’ wages and productivity.","The aging population is a challenge faced by many developed countries. The growing older population suggests not only an increase in the share of older adults who remain in the workforce but also a shift in the age distribution of the labor force. It raises the question of whether the productivity of older workers is the same as that of young or prime-age workers.====The level of productivity across individual workers may differ not solely based on their age but also based on other factors such as the accumulation of knowledge, skills, experience, and physical and technological capabilities. Yet, these factors do not always guarantee higher productivity. For instance, accumulated knowledge and experience may improve productivity (Disney, 1996) while advances in automation and artificial intelligence require some experienced workers to have new sets of skills that were not required in the past (OECD, 1998). Dated skills and technology often hinder innovation and negatively affect productivity (Dixon, 2003, Feyrer, 2008, Aksoy et al., 2019, Jones, 2010).====Korea is one of the countries that experience a rapidly aging population. Over the two decades, the share of older adults (50–64) among the working-age population (15–64) has significantly increased from 18.8 % in 2000 to 37.5 % in 2020 (KOSIS, 2021). The aging workforce is expected to accelerate even more due to a low birth rate and high life expectancy. Many firms are concerned that the aging workforce may cause high labor costs as older workers are likely to hold high occupational positions and receive high wages. Particularly in Korea, wages are often determined based on the level of education and years of employment. A large share of older workers with long years of employment may deteriorate the profitability of the business. There could be other problems related to the aging workforce such as promotion delays, lack of vitality and creativity within an organization, and low productivity of older workers. New knowledge and technology could make older workers less competitive compared to young and prime-age workers. Yet, despite the concerns about low productivity and high wages of older workers, no conclusive answer has been drawn on this matter.====An extensive body of literature has explored the relationship between age, productivity, and wages, and they provide mixed evidence. Many studies have examined an association between age and productivity using various measures of productivity. Several scholars have used total factor productivity (Aiyar et al., 2016, Poplawski-Ribeiro, 2020), GDP per labor input (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017, Maestas et al., 2016, Tang and MacLeod, 2006), sales per labor input (Bertschek and Meyer, 2009, Cardoso et al., 2011, Haltiwanger et al., 1999), wage per labor input (Burtless, 2013), and value-added per labor input (Aubert and Crépon, 2006, Bryson et al., 2020, Dostie, 2011, Hellerstein et al., 1999, Lallemand and Rycx, 2009, Mahlberg et al., 2013, Vandenberghe, 2011, Vandenberghe, 2013, van Ours and Stoeldraijer, 2011) as a measure of productivity. The direction and significance of the association that these studies have found vary not only by measures of productivity but also by sector and country.====To contribute to the literature on the relationship between the workforce age structure, wages, and labor productivity in the context of Korea, we investigate the effect of the workforce age structure on firms’ labor costs and productivity using wages and value-added per worker. As various factors may affect the age-productivity and age-wage patterns, we stratify the sample by sector, firm size, and region. Our analysis is based on the 2007–2019 Korea Workplace Panel Survey (WPS). The finding suggests that the shares of both young and older workers are negatively associated with wage per worker and value-added per worker of firms. After addressing the convergence effects related to wages and productivity, the results continue to show a negative association between the share of older workers and the labor costs and productivity of firms but no statistically significant association between the share of young workers and the labor costs and productivity of firms.====The disaggregation of the sample by sector, firm size, and region indicates no association between the share of young workers, wages, and productivity in the following areas: 1) all sectors; 2) all firm sizes; 3) the Capital Region (Seoul and surrounding areas including Incheon megacity and Gyeonggi province). Although the main results indicate a negative association between the share of older workers and firms’ wage per worker and labor productivity, the following areas suggest that older workers’ contribution to the productivity of firms is not statistically different from that of prime-age workers while their wages are lower than those of prime-age workers: 1) unstable and low-wage sectors; 2) small to medium-size firms with 30 to 299 employees; 3) the Capital Region and six other megacities.====The paper is structured as follows.

However, in 2020, the Government made otherwise illiquid plan balances temporarily liquid, offering emergency relief during the pandemic. The COVID-19 Early Release Scheme allowed participants in financial hardship easy access to up to $A20,000 of savings over two rounds. We use administrative and survey data from a large retirement plan to describe how and why participants withdrew savings under the scheme. A majority report that they needed the money immediately but around one quarter said they anticipated future needs. Most thought about the decision for less than a week, acted soon after each round opened, and withdrew as much as they could. Many people did not estimate, or appear to have mis-estimated, the impact the withdrawal could have on their retirement savings. Our findings offer insights into preferences for liquidity. They also raise questions about whether the features of the early release scheme, and their implied endorsement by the Government, influenced some withdrawers more than personal deliberations over financial welfare."," One of the first support measures relaxed tight limitations on early withdrawals of retirement savings. The COVID-19 Early Release Scheme (ERS) allowed people in financial hardship to withdraw up to $A20,000 of their retirement savings (‘superannuation’) in two rounds of up to $A10,000 each.==== After nearly-three decades of mandatory retirement contributions and strict controls over early withdrawals, founding principles of the Australian pension system were, temporarily, radically changed.====In this paper we examine the motivations and decision-processes of people who withdrew retirement savings using the ERS. We analyze administrative data on all participants (called ‘members’), and survey data from a sub-set of participants who withdrew money from their retirement account via the ERS, from a large Australian retirement plan. We also compare the surveyed plan withdrawers with a control sample who were eligible to withdraw, but chose not to, that we drew from the general population of plan participants. These three samples allow us to show: (i) who withdrew money from their retirement account under the ERS; (ii) how much they withdrew; (iii) why they took the money – specifically whether it was for immediate or future needs; and (iv) how they made the decision to withdraw, including how long it took them to decide and whether they estimated the impact of the withdrawal beforehand. We thus document the effect of a temporary rise in the liquidity of otherwise illiquid retirement balances during an economic crisis.====Before COVID-19, the Australian pension system tightly controlled withdrawals from retirement accounts. Australian workers who meet minimum age and income thresholds receive at least 10% of their earnings as employer contributions to individual defined contribution (DC) retirement accounts, similar to 401(k) accounts in the US.====).====Along with Australia, Chile, Peru, India, Spain and Portugal made early access to privately managed retirement savings easier during the COVID-19 downturn (====, ====). Countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, New Zealand and the United States have more lenient preservation rules in normal times. But pre-retirement access is rare where retirement saving is ====. Australia usually limits early withdrawals to cases of disability and terminal illness or severe financial hardship. And some restrictions apply to how early withdrawers can use the funds they access (====). Early access to retirement savings could affect retirement income adequacy in the future. Research into 401(k) and State pension plans in the US raise these concerns (====, ====). Similarly for Chile, where fund members could take up to 10% of their pension savings, in each of several rounds, as a response to COVID-19 (====, ====).==== calculate the current consumption that could be enabled by giving pandemic-affected US workers access to social security at actuarially fair rates. For Singapore’s mandatory DC plan, ==== found that access to some pension savings allowed liquidity constrained participants to better smooth consumption. Similar benefits have been confirmed in studies that evaluate shocks to income, health, and marital status (====, ====, ====). In addition to immediate consumption needs, people could access newly, and unexpectedly, liquid retirement savings as a precaution against possible future consumption needs (====, ====, ====).====Recent studies of socially optimal retirement system design propose that defined contribution systems serving participants with time-inconsistent preferences will be at least partially illiquid (====, ====, ====, ====). For example, ==== find evidence of ‘precautionary demand for liquidity’, where some participants forgo employer matches (i.e., accept a penalty) to meet anticipated needs.====Early-withdrawal penalties are a common measure of the liquidity of retirement balances. A completely liquid account applies no penalty for early withdrawals and a completely illiquid account applies an infinite penalty. In general, early-withdrawal penalties vary across developed country DC systems (====). The Australian ERS did not apply any explicit tax penalty (up to the $A20,000 limit) on withdrawals, which compares with a tax rate of up to 22% on standard early release funds.====, ====, ====). At the same time, plan returns are usually less than rates of interest on consumer debt. It follows that, although COVID ERS withdrawals were not taxed, the net outcome for participants depended on what they did with withdrawn funds and on their taxable income.====In our sample of ERS withdrawers, we found evidence of both consumption smoothing and a precautionary demand for liquidity: 58.7% of respondents reported that they withdrew from their retirement account to meet immediate expenses or to cover lost income; and 26.6% reported that they were motivated by future needs. Furthermore, conditional on eligibility, the estimated probability of withdrawal was significantly higher where respondents were concerned about future needs and were uncertain of future employment.====We also find considerable heterogeneity in the way people made their decisions. Around 50% of respondents thought about the decision for less than a week and a large minority under-estimated, or did not estimate, the impact on their retirement savings. Also, withdrawal patterns align with administrative features of the scheme. We observe that most people withdrew as much as they could – either the $A10,000 per round limit or (close to) their account balance. Withdrawals were bunched around the opening dates of each round and were made when other sources of financial support were available. While a rational participant could aim to smooth current or future consumption by choosing to withdraw the full amount immediately with little time spent thinking, the fact that so few participants deviated from this pattern suggests that the features of the scheme strongly impacted decisions.====Our research makes key contributions to several streams of research. First, we add to the literature on how people respond to economic shocks when given short-term access to previously illiquid retirement savings. We find evidence of both consumption smoothing (====, ====) and a precautionary demand for liquidity (====, ====). Second, we add to the growing literature on the apparent difficulty people have estimating the impact of lifetime saving and spending decisions (====). Finally, while several studies have examined how people have used COVID-19 stimulus payments and previously illiquid retirement savings (====, ==== and references therein; ====) and the impact of (lack of) trust in pension funds (====), we examine the decision-making process and behavioral influences that precede the decision to withdraw money.====The paper is set out as follows.

The number of retirees per worker in OECD Members is projected on average to increase by almost 40 % from 43.3 in 2022 to 59.3 in 2060, without changes to existing work and retirement patterns, or in the absence of significant changes to fertility patterns or higher immigration of working age people (OECD, 2019b). The pace of ageing will be particularly dramatic in Japan, Korea, and Germany. This could dampen the trend of rising living standards observed in previous decades and put enormous pressure on younger generations who will be financing social protection systems (Maestas and Zissimopoulos, 2010, Bloom et al., 2010, Aksoy et al., 2019).====Giving people better choice and employment opportunities at older ages will be key to help sharing the benefits of increased longevity more fairly and deliver inclusive labour markets in which skills and talents of different ages are put into use. The good news is that in recent decades employment rates for older workers aged 55–64 have increased significantly in many OECD countries. The employment rate for this group has risen from an average of 58 % across all OECD countries in 2015 to 61 % in 2021 (OECD, 2022a). This is largely due to reforms to pension systems including rising retirement ages as well as tightening of other working age benefits notably unemployment and disability to limit their use as alternative pathways to early retirement (OECD, 2019b).====However, while countries have been broadly successful in incentivising people to work longer, it has proven more difficult to increase new hiring of older workers and motivate employers to hire them. In 2021, on average, less than one in ten employees aged 55–64 were among new hires. This combined with relatively low mobility at older ages has also contributed to a high and growing share of all unemployed who are aged 55–64 ever since the global financial crisis in 2009 (Fig. 1). Moreover, in 2021, around 39 % of all older unemployed workers had been out of work for at least one year compared with 30 % of those aged 25–54.====The trend increase in the share of unemployed who are older people suggest that employment and skills policies need to focus more on this group to prevent long-term unemployment. Doing so is even more important in the current debate on ‘The Great Resignation’, which in some countries seems to be leading to older cohorts in particular being more likely to leave the labour force. It is too early to say whether this is a temporary or permanent phenomenon – there are some encouraging recent signs that it may be temporary – but it shows the importance of greater focus on job retention and job mobility for older workers. Promoting the hiring of, and helping older workers to stay in jobs, would also help ease some of the labour and skill shortages that have emerged in many countries during the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.====While there is a trade-off between job stability and job mobility at the aggregate level, for particular groups of workers and individual firms there may be welfare gains through either greater employment retention or greater mobility. From the employee perspective, some people may wish to leave a particular job to pursue a different career, others may be trapped in poor quality jobs which may eventually trigger early labour market exit. Improving job mobility for older workers who are displaced is also critical, as such workers face greater difficulties in finding new jobs and if they do, face large wage cuts (OECD, 2018).====Conversely, there are many sectors that are struggling to retain workers (see for example Sayli et al. (2022) and Moscelli et al. (2022) for the case of nurses and doctors in the United Kingdom’s National Health Service). More generally, retaining older workers is essential in response to the recruitment difficulties and unprecedented labour shortages that have occurred in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis. Overall, given the large costs of excessive employee turnover, improving employee retention by improving job quality can be mutually beneficial for workers and firms (OECD, 2023).",Time to change?

We argue that policies affecting work and policies affecting retirement are two sides of the same coin and must be considered together.","America – like many other highly industrialized countries with increased population longevity – is at a crossroads in its approach to work and retirement. In this piece, we focus on the challenges and policy options for Americans, but similar issues apply to the UK, many European countries, and other aging countries around the world. The findings summarized here are based on a new book we have edited, ==== (Berkman and Truesdale, 2022b), and many of our citations in this paper refer to its chapters.====As life expectancy has improved over the past half-century, societies have faced a critical question: how should these additional years of life be supported? In the U.S., as in other nations, the central policy response to population aging has been to cut pension benefits by raising retirement ages, based on the assumption that older adults can (and should) continue to work for pay. Many policymakers think it’s logical—almost inevitable—that Americans will delay retirement and spend more years in the paid labor force. It’s an intuitively appealing solution.====Working longer, it is argued, is a win–win–win solution for society, employers, and workers. It could cut the cost of pension benefits for an aging population; provide a bigger pool of experienced labor; and shore up individuals’ financial security. The idea that longer lives should translate into longer ==== lives has become mainstream policy.====When we started research in this area more than a decade ago with the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s initiative on Working Longer, that was our working assumption as well. But as it turns out, it’s an assumption that doesn't match the reality of a large and growing proportion of Americans. Precarious working conditions, family caregiving responsibilities, poor health, and age discrimination make it difficult or impossible for many==== ====to==== ====work into their late 60s and beyond. This is a problem: given America’s fragile retirement systems, many low- and middle-income workers cannot ever “afford” to retire (Gatta and Horning, 2022), and retirement security is often elusive even for those with more advantages.====Our concerns grew as we starting to identify who was working steadily throughout their 50s, because people can delay retirement only if they still have jobs to delay retiring ====. When we looked at these labor force statistics by education, the vulnerabilities among the less advantaged were huge; however, even among the best off, we discovered that fewer Americans were working steadily through their 50s than we had assumed. While working-longer policy conversations often focus on extending working lives beyond retirement ages such as 65, 67, or 70, we arguably need to pay more attention to those who leave the labor force or are working only intermittently in their 50s.====We realized it was time to rethink the working-longer policy framework. To deepen our collective understanding of the future of the American workforce and aging, we gathered researchers across economics, sociology, psychology, political science, and epidemiology. We charged them with examining how economic and social inequalities, coupled with changes across generations or birth cohorts, shape people’s capacity to work, the skills and resources they have, the discrimination and other challenges they face, and the benefits that may accrue to them from working longer.====The resulting book, ====, reveals that as we discuss opportunities for working longer, it is as important to understand the ==== of resources, abilities, and opportunities as it is to understand overall ====. We can’t understand the future of working longer without understanding social inequality. But even as marginalized social groups confront particular challenges, the consequences of fragile work and retirement systems are widespread.====New research in the book also reveals how the experiences of today’s middle-aged Americans differ from the experiences of today’s retirees. One consistent observation was that average changes across two or three decades are typically small compared to large and persistent inequalities between socioeconomic groups. Nonetheless, the trends are concerning: substantial sections of the generations now in middle age have faced more precarious jobs, greater caregiving responsibilities, no better health, and less responsive government than their counterparts at or beyond retirement age (Berkman and Truesdale, 2022a). Forecasts suggest that recent increases in employment rates at older ages are unlikely to be sustained (Hurd and Rohwedder, 2022).====We argue that if the United States wants to make working longer a healthy reality in the future, policymakers must level the social and economic playing field for young and middle-aged workers. Relatively small investments in better jobs today could lead to more secure retirements tomorrow. At the same time, we need a renovation of our retirement and disability systems to provide financial security for all Americans as they age.====In this paper, we focus on the evidence and policy options for the United States. Compared to most other developed nations, America has shorter life expectancies, higher poverty rates, and less generous public pensions (Hacker and Pierson, 2022), as well as less robust protections for workers (Berg and Piszczek, 2022). Trends in health and employment among middle-aged adults are not the same in Europe as in the United States (Börsch-Supan et al., 2022). Given the different contexts, the policies we suggest to improve the U.S. labor market and U.S. retirement security do not necessarily have direct parallels in other nations.====However, several of our fundamental premises are relevant internationally as governments respond to aging societies. First, policies affecting work and policies affecting retirement are two sides of the same coin and should be considered together. Second, working longer is set in motion long before one’s 60s; it is structured by one’s history of health, family, and work across the life course, suggesting that policies to encourage delayed retirement should address workers’ needs a decade or more before traditional pension eligibility ages. And finally, policy responses to population aging are more likely to be successful if they take into account multiple dimensions of inequality and heterogeneity as well as population averages. These insights should apply in all countries, although how they play out in policy terms will differ.",Working longer and population aging in the U.S.: Why delayed retirement isn’t a practical solution for many,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000706,15 December 2022,2022,Research Article,6.0

While most of the research has been devoted to decomposing the effects of age from influences related to cohort membership and time, the role of longevity is still not fully understood. Here, I provide some first evidence for the distinct effects of chronological age, of prospective age in terms of statistical life expectancy, and of subjective expectations about the length of life, for risk preferences and trust among the elderly.","Economic analysis of decision making is primarily related to describing how individuals solve trade-offs. These trade-offs involve, for instance, decisions about savings portfolios, or decisions about interactions with others, such as with whom to trade. On a more abstract level, individuals choose between alternatives with different exposure to risk regarding decision-related benefits, or make choices that involve social interactions and thus require elements of trust in other persons due to the lack of commitment. The usual way of modeling such decision problems is based on the interplay of preferences, constraints, and information, where preferences are typically assumed as stable determinants of decision-making that govern certain aspects, such as risk aversion. Explaining differences in outcomes by differences in preferences naturally entails the risk of tautological statements, which has led economists to view preferences as primitives and even disregard their heterogeneity for a long time (see, e.g., Stigler and Becker, 1977 on this point).====An increasing body of empirical research has developed measures of preference parameters that capture preferences in different dimensions, including, e.g., measures of risk aversion or social preferences. The parametric representation of preferences is rooted in the conventional way of economic modeling, where, e.g., risk aversion is conceptualized as the curvature of the utility function (Samuelson, 1937). Importantly, the empirical measures of these preference parameters have made it possible for researchers to study the distribution of preferences in the population, as well as their stability over the course of life. Variation in preferences over the life cycle does not necessarily pose conceptual problems as long as preferences remain external to decisions. As consequence, economists have not only acknowledged heterogeneity in preferences and variation over time or the life cycle. Some research has even modeled preferences as malleable, in the sense of a state variable, without leading to inconsistent decision making (for models with endogenous time preferences see, e.g., Becker and Mulligan, 1997, Strulik, 2012).====Yet, the empirical patterns of changes in preferences over the life course remain to be fully understood. The emerging evidence suggests that preferences vary with age and exhibit a life cycle profile (for a recent survey, see, e.g., Dohmen et al., 2023).====In the first part of this paper, I provide a brief overview of some of the aspects and recent findings concerning the age profile of preferences. In the second part of the paper, I turn to the role of life expectancy for preferences and attitudes. Recent work has documented that age affects preferences and attitudes, but little attention has been devoted to the distinction of chronological age and prospective age in terms of life expectancy. Especially among the elderly, this distinction becomes increasingly relevant, as statistical life expectancy declines, whereas subjectively perceived life expectancy might deviate substantially from the statistical life expectancy. Building on recent literature that has shown the importance of subjective life expectancy for decisions in various domains related to financial decisions or health, I construct a measure of subjective life expectancy for a sample of individuals above the age of 50 from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and contrast its influence on their risk aversion and trust from that of the expected remaining life years from of life tables.====The results document that the estimated age profile of risk preferences strongly depends on whether the influence of prospective age is accounted for. This is not the case for trust. Moreover, life expectancy correlates with proxy measures of preferences for risk and trust in different ways. The preliminary results also suggest that subjective life expectancy adds little above and beyond statistical life expectancy. The paper ends with an outlook to promising directions for future research.","Age, longevity, and preferences",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000597,5 December 2022,2022,Research Article,7.0

The paper concludes with suggestions for future research, including interindustry and international comparisons of microeconomic data on employment by age group and re-examining matched employee-employer data sets.","Across the world the labor force is getting older. This is resulting from a combination of demographic factors (increased longevity and lower birth rates) and changes in the labor market. More women in all age categories are working and a trend toward earlier retirement for men in the 1960 s through the early 1990 s reversed in the mid-1990 s.====This has created challenges for employers. They must strike a new balance between labor costs and productivity as the age mix of their organization changes. Firms with internal labor markets need to rethink how they manage flows of workers of different generations in and out of the organization and across positions within the organization. They must balance the risk of many older workers retiring at once, leaving gaps in critical positions and creating a loss of organizational knowledge, against the possibility they stay longer than expected, leading to blocked promotion opportunities of the next generation and turnover among younger workers. Workforce aging has a macroeconomic impact as well. The empirical evidence relating demographic change to productivity and GDP is mixed.====There is a hefty economics literature that digs deeply into the factors leading more older people to stay in the labor force longer. Improving health is no doubt one factor. Coile (2020) provides evidence that adjustments to Social Security and the replacement of defined benefit by defined contribution plans has encouraged longer careers in the US.====While there have been numerous studies of the labor supply and macroeconomic aspects of workforce aging, there has been relatively little research on the labor demand side. Employers have preferences regarding the age mix of their workers, depending on their customers, their production technology, and their need for business continuity. An increase in the labor supply of older workers will not be met by an equal increase in the quantity of labor demanded by each organization.====This paper summarizes key elements of the research literature in labor economics that address employer decisions about hiring and retaining older workers. Older workers are defined as those 55 and older. This group is of special interest because of three inevitable consequences of aging that differentiate them from younger individuals: (1) enhanced knowledge and skills accumulated over a career, (2) declines in cognitive and physical capabilities among some workers, and (3) a shorter time horizon for career-related decisions. Admittedly 55 and over is not a homogeneous group, as those 55–64 vary from those 65–69 or 70 and over in terms of labor cost, capability, time horizon and pension eligibility. This study also will not consider other sources of heterogeneity among older workers, including gender, ethnicity, and education.====The empirical literature examined here deals with the experience of the United States and other high-income countries. The employment-population ratio for older workers has risen across nearly all OECD nations since 2000, albeit with significant variation across those countries as will be shown later in the paper. The paper begins in Section 2 with an overview of the theoretical considerations driving employer choices. The primary consideration behind employer demand for older workers is the rate at which compensation costs and productivity change with age. In addition, there is the question of the best mix of employees by age group, which relates to (1) whether workers of different generations are substitutes or complements for each other and (2) how older workers interact with advanced technology. Empirical evidence regarding these matters is summarized in Section 3.====Another critical consideration is the transaction costs associated with the hiring of older workers. One possible concern is that firms do not believe older workers will stay with them very long, making them reluctant to invest in their human capital. Another is that older workers insist on work schedule and work environment accommodations that make them more costly or less productive. Even if these costs are negligible or nonexistent, some employers may believe otherwise and refuse to consider older workers for positions. There is a fine line between a transactions-cost argument for not hiring or retaining older workers versus pure and simple age discrimination. This paper examines the evidence associated with transactions costs and discrimination in Section 4.====Better understanding of these issues will inform decisions made by organizations about future staffing. It also will guide any innovations in public policy designed to encourage firms to hire or retain more older workers.==== The extent to which this would stimulate employer demand for older workers hinges on labor demand parameters. Section 5 discusses directions for future research that could yield deeper insight into how firms have responded to the aging labor force so far and might respond in the future.",Demand for older workers: What do we know?

Policies that aim to control the speed with which the virus propagates — mask mandates, lockdowns, and vaccine rollouts, for example — have been fiercely contested in the public arena. Additional policies to help households and businesses deal with the consequences of lockdowns and economic disruptions may not make headlines routinely, but they have also been bitterly disputed and have pushed political parties, legislators, and presidents to abandon or at least revise their platforms in an effort to promote the well-being of their constituents. One such policy concerns the rules that govern access to pension funds, which some policy-makers have sought to suspend temporarily in an effort to provide liquidity to cash-strapped households. Several countries have allowed early withdrawal of pension funds to support households dealing with adverse economic shocks as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.==== Early withdrawal of pension funds can be beneficial in contexts where individuals need to cope with financial shocks or have attractive investment opportunities. Prior research in the US shows that using pension assets to buffer economic shocks has limited erosion on retirement income (====, ====, ====, ====). However, early withdrawals can be harmful to individuals with present-biased preferences, especially if they are not aware of such biases.====In this paper, we examine the factors associated with support for a policy that allows early withdrawal of pension funds, such as the one implemented in Chile between July 2020 and April 2021. Specifically, the Chilean Congress approved three laws allowing early withdrawals of pension funds without any eligibility constraints or penalties in less than a year. According to the Chilean Bureau of Pensions, as of September 2021, 98% of affiliates had collectively withdrawn more than US$50 billion from their individual retirement accounts, and 3.9 million affiliates (34.9%) had depleted their pension savings after the third withdrawal. This is a remarkable case because, since the inception of the system in 1981, affiliates were not allowed to make withdrawals under any circumstances until they reached retirement age.==== will prefer to manage their savings themselves, in order to avoid the risk of being cheated. Regarding political ideology, those on the left of the political spectrum tend to distrust market-based economic solutions, including private pension funds, which would suggest that leftist respondents will be eager to obtain early access to their pension funds. The pandemic, its socio-economic consequences, and the current political context in Chile provide a unique setting to study individual preferences for policies over pension regulation.====We base our analysis on survey data collected during January 2021 from an online panel of 2,000+ respondents recruited to broadly resemble Chile’s adult population. The outcome of interest is a question that indicates the degree of agreement with the statement “Early withdrawal of pension funds should be allowed during the pandemic, without any type of penalty”. In line with our hypotheses, we observe that respondents that declare high levels of trust in Chile’s pension system, the financial system, and ==== and actors tend to oppose early withdrawal policies. In our baseline model, we find that a change from the lowest to the highest levels of trust in the pension system produces a drop of 21.4 percentage points in the probability of agreeing strongly with the early withdrawal policy. Similarly, respondents on the right of the political spectrum and those that voted for President Piñera during the 2017 general election also declare opposition to early withdrawals. Our estimates show that individuals on the right of the political spectrum are 15.8 percentage points less likely than leftists to strongly agree with such a policy. Our results are robust to the inclusion of variables that measure individuals’ perceived exposure to COVID, perceptions about the ability of authorities to respond to the pandemic and effects derived from tuning into specific sources of information (newspapers, radio, TV and social networks). Together, these findings suggest that assessments about the suitability of early withdrawal policies are not exclusively driven by respondents’ economic situations or by their perceived risks of exposure to COVID-19. To the contrary, trust and political attitudes and beliefs are strongly associated with policy views on changes to Chile’s pension-fund system.====Our study resonates with a large and growing literature showing that trust has a clear impact on financial decisions such as stock market participation (====), use of checks instead of cash (====), take-up of insurance products (====, ====), financial advice (====, ====), and use of savings and retirement accounts (====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Our study contributes to this literature by showing that trust is also associated with people’s support for policies that disallow unrestricted withdrawals of pension funds in a context of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.====, ====, ====). Closer to our concerns, “access to credit” appears to drive preferences for redistribution and for publicly-provided safety nets (====, ====, ====, ====). While these studies consider financial-market access as a driver of political attitudes, our study offers a useful counterpoint by documenting how political ideology can affect attitudes toward private pension fund access.====Our third contribution is to the study of ideological labels as cues that voters employ to assess alternative policy programs. Because policies that allow early withdrawal from defined-contribution plans are innovative and untested, it is not always obvious how individuals on the left and right of the political spectrum will evaluate such proposals. However, voters often act as “cognitive misers” that use heuristic processes to reduce the informational costs of forming opinions (====, ====). Party pronouncements and utterances from conspicuous politicians help citizens form opinions about unprecedented policies. Analyzing the Chilean early withdrawal policy gives us an opportunity to learn whether elite cues matter because President Piñera, the leader of a center-right coalition, took an early position against the policy. Though early withdrawal policies were implemented against a background of prolonged mobilization against pension fund administrators (====, ====), they were still drafted under a compressed timeframe. Hence, a finding that voters on the right of the political spectrum oppose them would resonate with the view that cue-taking is central to the process of belief formation. Beyond that, our study helps us understand how early withdrawal policies map on established ideological divides, regardless of the mechanism through which this mapping obtains.====In what follows, we first place Chile’s early-withdrawal proposals in context, emphasizing how these policies might impact the future solvency of the country’s pension system even as they provide short-term relief to those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We then draw on extant literature in ====In requesting that the joint distribution of age, socio-economic status, and gender in our online sample resembled the LAPOP distribution, our purpose was to obtain a balanced sample in terms of crucial social characteristics, rather than a truly representative sample of Chile’s voting age population. A truly representative sample would have been unattainable anyway in an online survey. By definition, Netquest’s panelists need to be able to connect to the internet, whether by ethernet or by phone, which means we are not sampling from the entire voting age population. However, Chile boasts one of Latin America's largest shares of internet penetration (internet users/population), at 82.3%, behind Argentina, Costa Rica, and Uruguay (====); admittedly, many individuals, especially older adults of lower socio-economic status are less likely to be adequately represented among panelists. Again, though, this specific challenge proved to be less consequential in Chile. When we submitted our request, Netquest had 145,697 verified panelists (Netquest follows the ISONorm 26362 to calculate the number of panelists); admittedly, the pool of panelists that engage with surveys may be smaller and “non-naïve”, though we judge this latter concern as less serious given that panelists tend to participate more in market/consumer studies than in academic research studies and that Netquest avoids repeatedly targeting panelists that have recently participated in other surveys.====We purported to sample about 2,100 respondents broken down by gender, age, and SEL score as in column (4) of ====. The survey obtained exempt status from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Washington University in St. Louis (study #202007185). Netquest circulated invitations to participate in the survey based on the quotas we requested (column (5), ====). Among those invited, 2,762 read our informed consent disclosure, 2,445 gave consent, and 2,091 finished the survey.

In this debate, the projections of the United Nations take a middle ground by assuming that life expectancy will continue to increase albeit at a slower pace and that all countries, at their individual adjustment speeds, converge to a rate of longevity improvement of 0.125 years per year (UN, 2019b).====An interesting question for health economics to address is how improving longevity affects (optimal) life cycle choices such as savings and retirement. Longevity, however, is itself endogenous and partly determined by life cycle behavior. In this paper, I resolve the endogeneity problem by focussing on medical progress. While medical technology is potentially endogenous at the macro level (see e.g. Böhm et al., 2021, it can safely be viewed as exogenous from an individual perspective. Specifically, I set up a health deficit model (Dalgaard and Strulik, 2014), calibrate it for an average U.S. American in the year 2010, and investigate how medical progress, conceptualized as increasing effectiveness of health spending in reducing health deficits, affects optimal lifetime health behavior and health outcomes.====The health deficit model is particularly useful to address this research question because its measure for health can be observed as the frailty index (in contrast to latent health capital, Grossman, 1972). The frailty index simply records the fraction of a large list of aging-related health conditions (deficits) that is present in an individual (Mitnitski et al., 2001, Searle et al., 2008). Biological aging defined as the intrinsic, cumulative, progressive, and deleterious loss of function (Arking, 2006) is expressed as gradual increase of the frailty index. The index is a measure of morbidity with very high predictive power for mortality (Mitnitski et al., 2002a, Mitnitski et al., 2002b, Dalgaard et al., 2022). It has been validated and used by countless studies in gerontology and, more recently, also in economics (see Strulik, 2022a, for a survey). Studies of different populations around the world have documented that, on average, individuals accumulate health deficits exponentially with age at a rate of 2 to 5 percent per year (Mitnitski et al., 2002a, Mitnitski et al., 2002b, Mitnitski and Rockwood, 2016, Harttgen et al., 2013, Abeliansky and Strulik, 2018, Abeliansky et al., 2020). The health deficit model predicts this outcome as a self-productive process of aging, in which the presence of health deficits leads to the development of new deficits. In contrast to chronological aging, biological aging is malleable. It can be accelerated or slowed down by health behavior. The efficacy of health investments in reducing health deficits is conceptualized as medical technology and improvements in efficacy as medical progress.====Longitudinal analyses of the frailty index have shown that, on average, later born individuals display fewer health deficits at given age. For cohorts from 14 European countries and Caucasian U.S. Americans born between 1908 and 1964 it has been estimated that the frailty index at any given age declined by 1.3–1.4 percent per year of later birth (Abeliansky and Strulik, 2019, Abeliansky et al., 2020). The long-run trend in longevity, cited at the beginning, can thus be conceptualized as an expression of the long-run trend of improving health.====Acknowledging that health improvements could have multiple causes, including rising incomes and an expanding public health sector, the estimated trend of the frailty index can be regarded as an upper bound on the ==== rate of medical progress. Here, we explore with counterfactual analyses how health behavior and health outcomes of the calibrated American change when medical technology changes. The model predicts that, taking behavioral responses into account, a 50 percent increase of medical technology leads to an about 20 percent decline of the frailty index (at age 65). Considering, for example, that the increase of technology was accomplished over a period of 20 years, the model’s prediction implies that a gross rate of progress of about 2 percent per year causes an effective rate of medical progress (decline in frailty) of about 1 percent per year.",Medical progress and life cycle choices,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000470,17 October 2022,2022,Research Article,13.0

While its potential negative economic effects have been discussed in both academic and policy forums, the fundamental question remains as how we should define the old-age population.==== Given ever-increasing life expectancy, one may wonder whether we can redefine the old-age population to understand better the economic effects of aging.==== Fig. 1 shows the median life expectancy (unit on the left axis) and the median share of people aged 65 or above (unit on the right axis) in 21 OECD countries from 1970 to 2018. Life expectancy has been consistently increasing over time, and so does the share of people aged 65 or above. In 1970, the median life expectancy was 71.7 years and the median share of the population aged 65 or above was 10.7%. However, in 2018 they jumped to 82 years and 19.1%, respectively, confirming that the population is aging in OECD countries.====Normally, the old-age population is defined as people aged 65 or above. In this paper, I first ask whether people categorized in this standard old-age group would have a homogeneous consumption-saving behavior, given ever-expanding life horizon. The standard fixed definition of old does not adjust to changes in potentially important factors such as retirement and remaining years to life expectancy. When one considers people aged 65 or above as a homogeneous group, one may not fully identify age-specific behaviors within this elderly group as the expected lifespan extends. If much longer time in retirement is expected, the consumption-saving behavior of the elderly can change such that agents save for a longer period of time to finance the rest of their lives.====This paper focuses on the relationship between population aging and real house prices. Since Modigliani and Brumberg (1954) pioneered the theory of life-cycle income and consumption, studies on the effect of demographic changes on asset markets have been based on the life-cycle hypothesis. The hypothesis predicts that agents save when they are in middle age and dissave when they are old to smooth consumption over their lifetimes.====Housing has a unique characteristic when analyzed in the framework of the life-cycle hypothesis because, on the one hand, it is an asset that should be dissolved or used as collateral to finance consumption in the later stage of life. On the other hand, it is an essential durable good as a living space that generates utility. For this dual role of housing, it is worth investigating if there are any heterogeneous relationships between different old-age groups and real house prices. For example, even if people are retired, as long as the remaining years to life expectancy are long enough, they should have no less demand for housing as a living space. This could generate heterogeneity between relatively younger old-age population and older old-age population when it comes to their consumption-saving behavior. Thus, studying this relationship among different subgroups of the old-age population and real house prices can be useful to understand the aging society and prepare relevant economic policies.====This paper empirically studies the relationship between different old-age dependency ratios and real house prices using data for 21 OECD countries from 1977 to 2018. To incorporate changes in retirement age and life expectancy in the definition of old, I redefine the old-age dependency ratio based on the effective retirement age and remaining years to life expectancy.====I find that an increase in the dependency ratio of people who are maximum 15 years away from life expectancy implies a decrease in real house prices. However, the dependency ratio of the effectively retired population is not significantly associated with real house prices. Given that the effectively retired population can include those who are younger than 65, the results indicate that the main driver of the negative association between population aging and real house prices is the short expected remaining life of elderly people rather than their exit from labor market per se. When I distinguish the old-age populations into the young–old and the old–old groups, the negative relation with real house prices is only significant with the old–old group, confirming the previous result in the literature. Also, the analysis between the price-to-rent ratio and old-age dependency ratios suggest that moving to a rented house (an increase in the rent prices) is a potential mechanism through which population aging is associated with a decrease in real house prices.====This study is related to two strands of the literature. In terms of the demographic effect on house prices, Mankiw and Weil (1989) famously analyzed age-specific housing demand using the U.S. census data and argued that future real house prices would drop significantly as baby boomers retire. Since then demographic effect on the housing market has been a topic that provides mixed empirical evidence in the literature. Studies find that population aging implies a significant decrease in real house prices in a cross-country setting (Takáts, 2012) or in a single country setting (Saita et al., 2013 for Japan and the U.S.; Hiller and Lerbs, 2016 for Germany). Some other studies report that the aging effect is negligible on house prices (Green and Hendershott, 1996 for the case of the U.S.; Hort, 1998 for Sweden; Chen et al., 2012 for Scotland; Eichholtz and Lindenthal, 2014 for England).====In the meantime, the literature of demographic effect on asset markets discusses various measures of population aging. Studies generally use five- or ten-year age groups (Goyal, 2004; Poterba, 2004), the size of working-age population (Nishimura and Takáts, 2012), the standard old-age dependency ratio (Krueger and Ludwig, 2007; Takáts, 2012), or the age of household member (Andrews and Sanchez, 2011; Eichholtz and Lindenthal, 2014). In this paper, I use the old-age dependency ratio, altering the threshold age for old in a way to reflect the change in effective retirement age and remaining years to life expectancy. These dependency ratios are similar to the economic dependency ratio and the prospective old-age dependency ratio discussed in Sanderson and Scherbov (2015) in the sense that the participation in the labor market and expected remaining life are considered to define old.====This paper contributes to the literature in the following three ways. First, it employs new measures of population aging in examining the aging effect on real house prices. Although the different old-age dependency ratios have been studied in the fields of demographic studies (Loichinger et al., 2017; Lau and Tsui, 2020), it has been rarely considered in the literature on house prices. Second, it provides supporting empirical evidence that the aging effect on real house prices is unlikely to be large even if life expectancy keeps increasing because the negative relationship is limited to a certain old-age group who has a short expected remaining life. Third, this paper reflects a high degree of heterogeneity in population aging among 21 OECD countries, including Japan and Korea, which are the fastest-aging countries in the world.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section “Data and measurement” describes data and introduces alternative definitions of old-age dependency ratios.

Using 2016 as the base year, we construct four scenarios for the year 2025 and use a ==== estimation approach to arrive at a complete and consistent framework of estimates for each of these scenarios. We find that the lifecycle deficit of the Dutch household sector worsens for all age groups. For the young this is partly covered by additional transfers received, but all households become more dependent on their assets and savings. To maintain the current level of disposable income wages must rise in all scenarios.","The Netherlands is faced with an ageing population, because of decreasing fertility numbers, and increasing longevity. This demographic pattern is reflected in many economic flows: wages paid to individuals in the working age, pensions received by the retired individuals, educational expenses mainly benefiting the young, and health expenses of the elderly. When demographic patterns of a country change, this impacts on these economic flows as well. In particular, labour-force participation is expected to fall because of ageing, and therefore also saving might decrease. Many fear that therefore, economic growth might fall back as well, with Japan’s economy as the ultimate example.====From the macro perspective the System of National Accounts (SNA) offers a tool for economic policy analysis, but this framework does not cover the age dimension and its distributions within the household sector. The methodology of national accounting as reflected in the System of National Accounts (UN, 2009), has been mainly used to analyse economic performance through Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As a measure of welfare, GDP is widely considered to be insufficient, and several authors, among which Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi in their influential Report by the commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress (2009), have recommended to focus instead on household income, and the distribution thereof. When distributions within the SNA are considered, often the focus is on income inequality, led by the work of Thomas Piketty (Piketty et al., 2018) and the World Inequality Lab (Alvaredo et al., 2020). To fully understand the implications of the ageing society, there is also a need for a clear understanding of the age patterns of the economic variables in the SNA.====The concepts of the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) (UN, 2013) were based on those of the SNA (UN, 2008). It was built around the concept of the economic lifecycle, initially addressed by Modigliani and Brumberg (1954). The NTA furthermore shows the different age structures in consumption needs and other economic transactions, allowing for an analysis of well-being benefitting different age groups and different generations.====The goal of the NTA is to better understand the generational economy. Much of the research in the field focuses on (the direction of) transfer flows and asset reallocations, and the effect that demographic changes had on the magnitudes of those transaction flows (Lee and Mason, 2011). Forward looking analysis within the NTA research mostly focuses on the benefits that societies can achieve from structural population changes. The effects of demographic changes on the lifecycle are often analysed in isolation, and not as part of the NTA framework, as described in Van Tongeren Jan, 2013, as part of the NTA Manual. Furthermore, much of the research focuses on countries in an early phase of development, i.e., those countries that can still benefit from an increasing labour force because of increasing population with many in the young ages (Oosthuizen, 2015, Dramani and Oga, 2017).====An application of the NTA as an analytical tool, is found in a study of the savings behaviour in anticipation of prolonged retirement. Projecting to as far as 2300, Mason and Lee (2007) found an increase in income from assets relative to labour income, using simulations of consumption, savings, and asset development. However, in support of this, there is a task for policy makers, because the demand for wealth in the late years of life can be met in different ways and could take out the incentive to save (Lee and Mason, 2010). Reforms help to relieve the stress ageing puts on the government expenses, but generates impacts on household income, and savings behaviour. The effect on savings is not clear cut though; individuals who expect to live longer might anticipate their longer period of inactivity in retirement through higher savings. But they also might choose to remain in the labour force longer and draw down on their savings at a later point in their lifecycle (Wong and Tang, 2013, Pascual-Saez et al., 2020).====The goal of this paper is to present a methodology that can be used to study the effects of demographic changes in the short-term. We analyse how population ageing affects the household sector and the distribution of Household (HH) Disposable Income==== by age groups. We do this by combining age-specific information based on micro data and demographic data for 2016 with projections of National Accounts data to 2025. By choosing the distribution of HH disposable income ====, instead of traditional GDP and its growth, it also follows the recommendations by Stiglitz et al. (2009).====To achieve this, we create an extended National Transfer Accounts (NTA) framework, including not only the traditional SNA tables, but also age profiles for the household sector and the NTA framework with lifecycle and other balances for the analysis of the data. We construct four scenarios for the year 2025 and use a Bayesian estimation approach to arrive at a complete and consistent framework of estimates for each of these scenarios. The four scenarios are to be considered as different consistent views of how the economic variables in our framework might develop in the medium-term. The impact of these scenarios is based on projected fixed values for 2025 of exogenous variables. The exogenous variables included are the values of GDP, total HH disposable income, all GOV sector variables, exports, and population and employment by age groups.====We find that the lifecycle deficit, as defined by the difference between age specific labour income and consumption, of the Dutch household sector worsens for all age groups. For the young this is partly covered by additional transfers received, but all households become more dependent on their assets and savings. To maintain the current level of HH disposable income, wages must rise strongly in all scenarios, and in some cases, part of the tax burden needs to shift to the corporate sector. Our approach differs from most NTA analyses, because we do not project the NTA in isolation, but incorporate the effects in the larger NTA framework, which includes the SNA accounts of production, employment, supply and use and sector accounts of the SNA. This increases, in our opinion, the usefulness of these estimates. Demographic changes will affect the household sector, but through framework links (identities and ratio’s) other economic activities and sectors will be affected too, and choices made by other actors in the economy, will change the economic effects of demographic changes as well.====The study is described in subsequent sections of this article. In Section 2 the methods and materials used in this study are discussed. These include the frameworks, the Bayesian estimation approach, the scenarios used in the analysis, and the data sources and their reliabilities of the macro and micro HH sector accounts. Section 3 presents the analysis of the projections to 2025, based on the four different scenarios. We focus there on the results for the distributions within the household sector, using the alternative format of the National Transfer Accounts framework. Section 4 summarizes and concludes.

Poor health limits the ability of individuals to engage in income-generating activities, and it affects labour force participation, hours of work, and consequently income (Currie and Madrian, 1999, Leivea and Xub, 2008). This issue is of particular importance among the elderly in sub-Saharan Africa because elderly individuals are the key source of labour in the agricultural sector. They therefore contribute immensely to Africa’s economy, which largely depends on agricultural outputs, but they are less likely to receive proper healthcare (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2014, Aboderin and Beard, 2015).====One major factor contributing to poor health in developing countries is the high cost of health care treatment and out-of-pocket health expenditures. High medical costs reduce access to health care and this in turn affects health outcomes. Many elderly individuals in developing countries work in the informal sector and are without formal health insurance coverage. Hence, they face difficulties in affording to pay for their health care expenses when they fall ill. This often results in deferment of medical treatment, which can have serious health consequences (Xu et al., 2006, Leivea and Xub, 2008).====The paper studies how health insurance affects economic and health care outcomes of the elderly in Ghana. The paper focuses on the elderly as health expenditure is shown to increase with age, with a significant proportion of lifetime health care expenditures occur- ring after the age of 65 years (Alemayehu and Warner, 2004). The ability to meet medical expenses is therefore a challenge for many elderly individuals in low-income countries. To this end, universal health insurance has been advocated as a means to improve access to health services without exposing individuals to financial hardship (World Health Organization, 2010). Studies have shown how subsiding health care through health insurance has improved healthcare access and health outcomes of the elderly in both developed and developing countries (Card et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2009, Cheng et al., 2015, Duku et al., 2015). However, studies on labour market of the elderly are limited.====There are theoretical predictions of having free health insurance. One of these predictions is the moral hazard behaviour which normally leads to over utilisation of health care services (Einav and Finkelstein, 2018, Dave and Kaestner, 2009, Sapelli and Vial, 2003). In addition, moving to a system of free health insurance results in income effect which leads to less labour supply. Besides, a standard static labor supply model also predicts that health insurance reduce the incentive to remain in the workforce and likely reduce the incentive to increase work hours (Boyle and Lahey, 2010, Dague et al., 2017). It also has productivity effect thus; healthy workers can work more which in turn affects earnings. The prediction is that the availability of health insurance improve health which reduces the disutility of work and increasing labor supply and earnings (Gruber and Hanratty, 1995, Dizioli and Pinheiro, 2016, Devaraj et al., 2017).====The study therefore seeks to understand whether having free health insurance affects healthcare utilisation, hours worked and earnings by the elderly. The study sample comprises of elderly Ghanaians who are over the age of 55 years and who remain physically able to engage in agricultural work. The empirical strategy exploits a policy change in 2003 when Ghana introduced a National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) that exempts elderly individuals age 70 years and over from having to pay for NHIS premiums. Using individual-level data from the Ghana Living Standard Survey and a propensity score matching difference-in-differences (PSMDID) framework, the study finds that having health insurance increases the elderly visits to a health facility and the probability of being treated by health professionals. In terms of labour market outcomes, the findings show that insurance increases the number of hours worked and earnings. The study used difference-in-difference (DID) strategy as robustness check and the results are similar to the PSMDID estimates. The results are consistent with labour productivity effect of health insurance theoretical model prediction.====The study contributes to the literature in two main ways. Firstly, the study focuses on elderly individuals working in the informal sector, which forms the basis of the labour force in the agriculture sector in developing countries. Most of the existing studies focus on formal sector workers (Gruber and Madrian, 2002, Boyle and Lahey, 2010, Dague et al., 2017). Understanding the effect health insurance has on elderly people working in the informal sector is important as these individuals play a significant role in the economic development of many developing countries. Secondly, existing studies that look at the effects of health insurance on the labour market outcomes are largely from developed countries, and there is limited rigorous evidence from developing countries, especially countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The study of this relationship contributes to the evidence base of health policy design in Ghana and more broadly the sub-Saharan Africa region.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows.

And it seems equally odd to focus on the limits to central banks’ ability to ease monetary policy. In the post-pandemic economy, fiscal expansions, an energy crisis and unusually tight labour markets have pushed central banks away from their effective lower bound on interest rates.====This paper is about what happens after that, some years hence, once inflation has been tamed. I argue that there is a significant risk that we will return to a low interest rate environment, in which case the limits to monetary policy would again be tested.====I argue that we are only about two thirds of the way through a multi-decade demographic transition that is pushing down interest rates.

Changes in family structure and the death of spouses, relatives, and friends often make it difficult for older people to find help. Long-term care is paid care for people who need any form of support. It is not intended to solve medical problems but to help cope with functional limitations or chronic health conditions and maintain a good quality of life (OECD, 2020). As older people may experience economic challenges while utilizing long-term care services, many countries publicly finance long-term care services through government funding or compulsory insurance schemes (OECD, 2020).====In 2008, Korea implemented a public Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) program to provide better access to quality long-term care services at low prices and contribute to the economic wellbeing of older people by alleviating the financial burden of long-term care and healthcare services. This paper studies the health and economic effects of LTCI on beneficiary households who have received long-term care benefits for at least one year during the post-intervention period using the 2006–2019 Korean Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS).====The KOWEPS dataset has rich information on the economic and health situations of individuals, including on LTCI beneficiary status. KOWEPS makes it possible to identify LTCI beneficiary status at the household level but it makes it impossible to distinguish between LTCI beneficiaries and other individuals within the household. Given that more than 95 % of LTCI beneficiaries are older adults aged 65 and above (MOHW, 2019), we select households living with at least one older adult as our study sample. We measure the impact of LTCI on household economic outcomes (expenditures and savings), and individual health outcomes (healthcare utilization and self-rated health) for older adults aged 65 and above. Households who report receiving LTCI benefits at least one year during the post-intervention period are the treatment group. We compare them with non-beneficiary households who have never received the LTCI benefits during the same period.====This study uses a difference-in-differences (DID) model combined with propensity score matching (PSM). The DID model allows us to compare the differences in outcomes of the beneficiary and non-beneficiary households before and after the intervention while controlling for heterogeneous biases and time-specific unobservable factors (Stuart et al. 2014). PSM makes it possible to identify non-beneficiary households whose observed attributes are similar to those of beneficiary households and thus aims to address potential selection biases that may rise due to the LTCI application process. We use an event study specification to assess the validity of the parallel pre-trend assumption. We stratify the results by family structure and gender, income level, and health insurance type.====The findings of the study suggest that beneficiary households are likely to save less but spend more on healthcare services compared to non-beneficiary households. Beneficiary households tend to receive fewer health check-ups while those with inpatient visits stay longer in the hospital. Longer days of hospitalization might have contributed to the beneficiaries’ higher level of out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures and lower level of savings. Older people in beneficiary households tend to maintain better self-rated health than those in non-beneficiary households. These results hold among the non-poor, national health insurance users, and single families.====This paper is structured as follows.

Faced with enormous challenges in supporting older population, disease prevention and control are of crucial importance for individuals, families, and society. However, the performance of chronic disease management is far from satisfactory. The overall diagnosis, treatment and control rates of hypertension, for instance, are low in some developed countries; and the rates are even worse in developing countries, including China (World Health Organization, 2019). Moreover, as the population ages, a growing size of population is living with cognitive impairment (CI) including dementia, which makes disease management even more difficult and demanding (Livingston et al., 2020, Winblad et al., 2016). Declining cognitive function may interfere with patients’ ability to detect health changes and adhere to disease management strategies, engendering new barriers for effective disease management and control, thereby increasing the risk of CI and leading to a vicious cycle (Feil et al., 2012).====The challenges are particularly acute in China, where a huge number of older adults are living with NCDs, and cognitive impairment with or without dementia (Chan et al., 2013, Jia et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2013, Zhou et al., 2019, Zhou et al., 2016). Amid the escalating long-term care needs and the rapid aging trend, long-term services and supports (LTSS) are expected to play pivotal roles in China, especially given its potential for disease management (Disler et al., 2012, Tan et al., 2019). However, there is limited evidence assessing the impacts of LTSS in developing contexts. In China, the long-term care for older adults relies primarily on family members and informal caregivers, with increasing demands for formal LTSS including home-based and community-based services (Feng et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the capacity of the long-term care system is still concerning and the effectiveness of the LTSS remains to be examined. Notably, with reduced fertility in the past decades coupled with rapid urbanization and increased labor mobility, informal caregiving and support provided by family members and relatives is being increasingly strained (Feng et al., 2020, Feng et al., 2012). Meanwhile, despite recent efforts to reform long-term care system, formal LTSS, such as home and community-based services, are still underdeveloped (Feng et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2018). Facing the marked demographic shifts and system changes, it is very important to evaluate the availability of informal and formal LTSS in China, as well as their effectiveness in facilitating disease prevention and control. The assessment is particularly critical among people with cognitive impairment, who have special needs in long-term care but face increased difficulties in obtaining services and supports (Wang et al., 2018).====Using nationally representative physical examination and survey data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), this paper assesses the availability of LTSS among Chinese older adults and evaluates their impacts on preventive care utilization, hypertension awareness and management. In particular, we investigate the heterogeneity across older adults in different stages of CI.====We find that, LTSS are generally inadequate among Chinese older adults, particularly for those with CI. The overall utilization rates of home- and community-based services are quite low among all older adults; and older adults with more severe stages of CI are less likely to have access to spousal supports. Besides, the performance of disease management is consistently poorer among cognitive impaired older adults. Specifically, we find older adults with mild CI or severe CI have lower chance of receiving physical examination, become less aware of own hypertension status, and tend not to monitor blood pressure (BP) regularly or even annually as compared to those without CI. Severe CI, for example, leads to 42 % lower odds of annual physical examination, 51 % lower odds of hypertension awareness, 49 % lower odds of annual BP examination, and 52 % lower odds of regular BP examination relative to no CI.====We show that overall, access to LTSS can benefit older adults’ disease management, with informal supports being more impactful than formal services. In particular, the effects of spousal supports are large and significant for disease prevention, hypertension awareness and monitoring; whereas formal home-based services only have significant positive effect on regular and annual BP examination. Moreover, the effects of LTSS seem to differ between older adults with and without CI. Some LTSS, such as spousal and home-based services, only have strong and significant impact for cognitively normal individuals. By contrast, no significant effect of LTSS on disease management are found for cognitively impaired individuals, despite some modest evidence suggesting the potential role of community-based services in equalizing the gaps of health education between individuals with and without CI.====These findings may contribute to the existing literature in several ways. First of all, we are one of the first to document the cognitive gradients in a broad range of disease management outcomes, both in preventive care utilization and hypertension management. We also show differences in access to LTSS across older adults in different stages of CI. Previous studies largely focus on the relationship between cognitive ability and self-management of a particular disease, usually with small sample size (Feil et al., 2012, Hajduk et al., 2013, Kiza and Cong, 2021, Lovell et al., 2019, Sinclair et al., 2000), while less attention is paid to disease prevention. Studies in China, on the other hand, mostly focus on the socioeconomic differences in disease management, neglecting the potential heterogeneity by cognitive ability (Feng et al., 2014, Li and Lumey, 2019, Lu et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2016). Our study thus fills the gap by highlighting the high vulnerability of cognitively impaired individuals in utilizing preventive care and managing chronic diseases.====Second, we provide novel evidence on the impacts of informal and formal LTSS on the performance of disease management. While there is a growing body of studies showing the health impacts of LTSS, such as their impacts on physical function, mental health, harms, and mortality, evidence on disease prevention or chronic disease management is limited, especially in developing contexts (Disler et al., 2012, Sohn et al., 2020, Tan et al., 2019, Wysocki et al., 2015). This study enriches our understanding of the effects of access to LTSS on both preventive care utilization and the management of hypertension among Chinese older adults. Our results suggest that informal care still plays a critical role, while formal care only has modest impact on disease management. Continuous efforts, therefore, should be devoted to developing accessible, high-quality, and well-targeted home- and community-based services.====Finally, we reveal the differential effects of LTSS on disease management among older adults in different stages of CI. To our best knowledge, no study to date has shown the heterogenous effect of LTSS on disease management by stage of CI. In our study, we demonstrate that cognitively impaired older adults in China tend to benefit less from LTSS compared to those without CI. Our findings thus emphasize the increased vulnerability of older adults with CI in disease management, especially with weakening informal care; and point to the importance of promoting targeted interventions to reduce their barriers of receiving and utilizing LTSS.",Long-term services and supports and disease management among older Chinese adults in different stages of cognitive impairment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000378,8 August 2022,2022,Research Article,19.0

We exploit a sizable cohort-specific pension reform for women using a Difference-in-Differences approach. The analysis is based on official records covering all individuals insured by the public health system in Germany and including all certified diagnoses by practitioners. This enables us to gain a detailed understanding of the multi-dimensionality in these health effects. The empirical findings reflect the multi-dimensionality but allow for deriving two broader conclusions. We provide evidence that the increase in the retirement age negatively affects health outcomes as the prevalence of several diagnoses, e.g., mental health, musculoskeletal diseases, and obesity, increases. In contrast, we do not find support for an improvement in health related to a prolonged working life. These findings are robust to sensitivity checks, and do not change when correcting for multiple hypothesis testing.","Aging populations present immense challenges for public pension systems due to growing numbers of beneficiaries and declining numbers of contributors. To sustain the systems’ financial stability, policy makers across the OECD have introduced pension reforms which raised retirement ages. While postponing retirement has the potential to increase pension contributions and to reduce the share of pension benefit recipients, a prolonged working life might also have consequences for the health of individuals. Thus, to understand and to assess the overall impact of changes to the pension system, it is crucial to quantify and fully understand the health implications of pension reforms.====In this paper, we study the health effects of an increase in the retirement age using official data on certified diagnoses by practitioners based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for the period from 2009 to 2018. The detailed information on specific diagnoses and groups of diseases allows us to analyze the implications for health outcomes in a multi-dimensional way. This detailed analysis is important since broader health measures which have been used in most of the previous studies, might disguise potentially negative or positive implications for different health dimensions.====To identify the causal effect of an increase in the retirement age on diagnoses, we exploit a sizable and cohort-specific pension reform which was implemented in 1999. The reform abolished an early retirement program for women born in 1952 and after==== and thereby effectively increased the early retirement age (ERA) for women from age 60 to at least 63. It provides a clean quasi-experimental setting as it induces a substantial discontinuity in retirement ages for two adjacent cohorts (women born in 1951 versus women born in 1952). Using the same variation, Geyer and Welteke (2021) and Geyer et al. (2020), analyze the employment effects as well as distributional consequences of the pension reform and show that the reform led to substantial individual labor market responses, including increased employment between age 60 and 62. Moreover, Etgeton et al. (2021) show that the reform had negative effects on private savings.====Using data covering 2009 through 2018, we can consistently analyze the health effects for women aged 59, i.e. before the reform had a direct effect on employment (age-59-effects), for women aged 60–62 (main effects) and for women aged 63–65, which we define as post employment period.====In the main analysis we use a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design. The medical and demographic literature documents that health outcomes are correlated with month of birth as well as with cohort effects (e.g., Boland et al., 2015, Doblhammer and Vaupel, 2001). Therefore, it is crucial to account for cohort and seasonality (month of birth) effects to isolate the causal effect of the pension reform on health. Similar to Schönberg and Ludsteck (2014), we define a treatment group (women born between October 1951 and March 1952) and a control group (women born between October 1950 and March 1951) which captures cohort and seasonality effects.====In the analysis, we focus on three dimensions of health: mental health, physical health, and health care consumption. Within these dimensions, we concentrate on groups of diseases that are most likely affected by lifestyle choices and that have been used in existing studies on the link between health and retirement. Within these groups, we select the diagnoses most frequently causing rehabilitation treatments prescribed by the pension insurance in the application process of invalidity benefits (“Erwerbsminderungsrente”). More precisely, we analyze the impact of the increase in the retirement age on mood (affective) disorders and on neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (hereafter: stress-related diseases) to assess the effects on mental health. For the physical health dimension, we consider the group of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertensive diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases (strokes)) as well as the group of musculoskeletal diseases (arthrosis and other dorsopathies). In addition, we study hypertension since this is the most common physical disease within our sample, but is not captured using the rehabilitation criterion. To estimate the impact on health care consumption, we examine the annual number of treatment cases.====Our empirical findings provide evidence that the increase in the retirement age has a negative effect on health outcomes as the prevalence of several diagnoses, e.g. mental health, musculoskeletal diseases, and obesity, increases. In contrast, we do not find support for an improvement in health related to a prolonged working life since there is no significant evidence for a reduction in the prevalence of any health outcome we consider. These findings are robust to sensitivity checks, and do not change when correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. Further, placebo tests provide empirical support for the identification assumptions of the DID.====In particular, we find that the pension reform increased the prevalence of both mental diseases in 60–62 year old women. The effect amounts to 3.6 percent for stress-related diseases and to 4.8 percent for mood disorders relative to the respective pre-treatment means. The effects for 59 year old women are of similar significance and about twice as large. Within the physical health dimension, our results suggest that raising the retirement age increases the prevalence of dorsopathies, arthrosis and obesity at ages 60–62 years as well as 59 years. For other physical health outcomes, our results are less clear but, as mentioned above, we do not find significant evidence of an improvement in physical health in response to the reform. Furthermore, we find significant effects of the reform on healthcare consumption for 59 year olds. Overall, our findings reflect the multi-dimensionality of health but allow us to conclude that the reform had negative and significant effects on some health outcomes and did not have positive and significant effects on any of the considered health outcomes. Additional analyses on post-employment effects suggest that the majority of the effects persist into retirement (at age 63–65), but effect sizes are smaller compared to the direct effects on 60–62 year old women.",The effects of an increase in the retirement age on health — Evidence from administrative data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000354,1 August 2022,2022,Research Article,20.0

We study the implications of own and partner’s retirement on measures of ==== associated with their own or their partner’s retirement.,"Retirement is a major event in the lives of individuals. Undoubtedly, this important life change not only affects the individual who has retired from the labour force, but also those around them – particularly their partner. There is an obvious degree of interdependence in retirement outcomes between individuals in a couple relationship. Yet ironically, economics studies have tended to neglect this, often analysing the effects of retirement on wellbeing in a way which has implicitly assumed independence of retirement experiences between men and women in couple relationships. Failing to consider the spill-over effects of individuals’ retirement on the wellbeing of partners may have caused the overall effects of retirement to be understated. This study addresses this important gap in the literature by providing a gendered intra-household analysis of the effects of individuals’ retirement on their own and their partner’s wellbeing. Drawing on a longitudinal panel dataset from Australia, the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, this study disentangles both the contemporaneous and intertemporal intra-household spill-over aspects of own retirement and partner’s retirement on three domains of subjective wellbeing (SWB) including, overall life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, and satisfaction with free time.====Contributing to the lack of attention to the intra-household impacts of retirement, early household economics models assumed that households have a single utility function and, accordingly, resources of household members are presumed to be used jointly in a way which maximises household utility as decided by the (usually male) head of the household (Becker, 1981). Applied to retirement, these models suggest that individuals in a couple relationship would benefit from household wealth (including retirement savings) in a way that would not depend on who made the contributions to this wealth. In turn, this would imply some level of symmetry in the cross-partner effects of retirement on wellbeing. Yet, the unitary model fails to address meaningful questions on how resources are actually redistributed between individuals within the household, and how a skew in income can imply consumption differentials and economic dependency of one partner with implications on wellbeing (see Folbre, 1986, Strassmann, 1993, Woolley, 1993, Bergmann, 1995). It does not allow for differing preferences between marital partners, nor conflicts in decision-making between them.====Acknowledging that a process of bargaining takes place within the household, collective models of the household focus on the distribution of power within the household, and its consequences for the intra-household allocation of resources and wellbeing. The models often link partners’ bargaining power with factors such as relative incomes earned by each spouse (Browning et al., 2014). For couples approaching retirement, each partner’s bargaining power is likely to be influenced by their labour-market opportunities and their accumulated wealth. In many households, women may find themselves in a relatively weak bargaining position, as individuals’ wealth position at retirement is likely to closely reflect their employment history. Employment experiences themselves are gendered, with women commonly earning lower wages and facing more career interruptions than men when child rearing (Austen and Mavisakalyan, 2018). Yet conversely, with retirement and the loss of labour-market earnings that this entails, bargaining power in the household may become more equal, with consequences for the allocation of resources (Lundberg, 2000). Either way, retirement is likely to lead to a change in the bargaining environment between older couples, with likely repercussions for each partner’s wellbeing.====This study explores how changes in overall life satisfaction are associated with individuals’ own retirement and that of their partner. As noted, the collective models of the household imply that the partner with greater control over household resources will be more likely to achieve allocation of resources that best reflects their interests. In turn, this perspective suggests that at retirement, as at other points in the life course, the intra-household distribution of the benefits and costs associated with changing circumstances will favour the partner with greatest access to resources, and this is likely to have implications for the pattern of change in overall life satisfaction between men and women in couple relationships.====In addition to analysing the changes in overall life satisfaction, this study examines two other domains of subjective wellbeing – financial satisfaction and satisfaction with free time – and how these are affected by retirement. These domains are important components of overall life satisfaction and measures of how they change with one’s own and/or one’s partner’s retirement offer a more comprehensive view into the effects of retirement on wellbeing (Bonsang and Klein, 2012). Financial satisfaction has been shown to have important influences on overall life satisfaction (Van Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2004, Easterlin, 2006). Furthermore, for men and women in couple relationships, retirement may have an important impact on each partner not only through changes in household income and the perceived benefits from it, but also through changes in free time.====This study also examines the intertemporal effects of retirement through an analysis of changes in overall life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, and satisfaction with free time before and after one’s own and one’s partner’s retirement. This accounts for the anticipation and adaptation effects of retirement, whereby the prospect of retirement is likely to affect wellbeing in the lead up to the event, and post-retirement individuals are likely to adapt to their new circumstances. It could be expected that changes in wellbeing effects vis-à-vis anticipation and adaptation to retirement may be different for men and women depending on each partner’s access to resources.",Retirement and the distribution of intra-household wellbeing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000366,29 July 2022,2022,Research Article,21.0

For the identification we use plant closures as a source of exogenous variation and combine difference-in-differences with matching based on entropy balancing. The analysis is based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). We find that there is a time conflict between employment and informal care provision. Unemployment increases the probability of providing care by 2.9 percentage points while the daily hours of care provision rise by around 0.05 h per week-day. Both men and women react with significant increases in care provision. We find the largest effects for women with low education.,"Population aging creates excess demand for long-term elder care (LTC). Therefore, one of the most pressing challenges for social policy is to increase the supply of formal and informal care (Gusmano and Okma, 2018, van Groenou and De Boer, 2016, Geerts et al., 2012). The extension of informal care is of particular importance since both the care dependent and policy makers prefer care provided by family and friends in the elder person’s home (Lipszyc et al., 2012, Blaise, 2018, Mentzakis et al., 2009, Hajek et al., 2018). The majority of care providers is younger than 60 years old and is still in the work force. This suggests that informal care providers face a time conflict between care provision and gainful employment which might be an important restriction to further increase informal care. It is therefore important to document and understand the time conflict between employment and informal care provision. However, this is challenging as the identification of the effect of employment on the decision to provide informal care requires exogenous variation in employment.====In this paper we follow e.g. Halla et al. (2020) or Marcus (2013) and use plant closures as a source of exogenous variation for employment. This allow us to estimate the effect of unemployment on informal care provision. In more detail, for the empirical analysis we combine difference-in-differences with entropy balancing, similar to Everding and Marcus (2020). In addition, we analyze the effect of unemployment using an event study design. The analyses are based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) which contains information on employment, informal care provision and other socio-economic variables such as income, heath and education.====Our results provide evidence for a time conflict between employment and informal care provision. In the main specification we find that after entering unemployment the probability of providing care increases on average by 2.9 percentage points while the daily hours of care provision rise by around 0.047 h per weekday. The results are robust to various robustness checks including placebo tests. We further show that while the effect is present for both men and women, it is larger in absolute terms for women but larger in relative terms for men. When focusing on heterogeneous effects we can show that effects are largest for women with low education.====This study is related to several strands of the literature. A large number of previous studies focuses on the link between employment and informal long-term care provision. Heitmueller, 2007, Jacobs et al., 2017, Van Houtven et al., 2013, Carr et al., 2018, Niimi, 2017, among others, find negative short term effects of providing informal care on labor market outcomes.==== Other papers analyze the implications of employment on care provision. For example, He and McHenry (2016) find that working 10% more hours per week reduces the provision of informal care among US American women by around 2 percentage points; Mentzakis et al., 2009, Michaud et al., 2010, Moscarola, 2010, Nizalova, 2012, Stern, 1995, Golberstein, 2008, Fischer and Müller, 2020, Bergeot and Fontaine, 2020, Carrino et al., 2019, come to similar results but study different margins of labor supply.====Our study is also linked to the analyses by Mommaerts and Truskinovsky (2020) and Costa-Font et al. (2015). They show that informal care provision is affected by the business cycle. Interestingly, Mommaerts and Truskinovsky (2020) discover that informal care provision among adult sons reacts counter-cyclically to the business cycle. This suggests that higher unemployment rates and lower opportunity costs matter in son’s choice to provide informal care. In contrast, adult daughters do not seem to react to unemployment rates. Costa-Font et al. (2015) find an increase in the availability of informal care following the Great Recession in Europe, suggesting that rising unemployment rates could increase informal care provision. While these papers point to a relevant link between the business cycle and informal care provision, a variety of possible channels can explain these results. Our approach focuses specifically on the effects of unemployment on informal care provision and can therefore shed more light on this important margin. Our paper is to the best of our knowledge the first to study the impact of isolated unemployment events on individuals’ informal caregiving.====The remainder of this study is structured as follows: Section “Institutional background” describes the institutional setting of the long term insurance and unemployment insurance in Germany. Section “Methodology” explains the identification strategy. Section “Data” describes the data and variables used in the estimation.

Using the geocoded Health and Retirement Study, we statistically estimate the importance of adult child proximity on older adult moves after controlling for a host of other factors. We find that having adult children nearby is associated with a lower propensity to move, with closer proximity generally having a stronger negative relationship, up to a distance of 50 miles. These results are more pronounced if we define mobility as having moved at least 30 miles, or across ====. We also show that the relationship is stronger for those with care needs, and for renters compared with homeowners. Results for the baby boomer cohort suggest that the proximity of children continues to have an important influence on older adult mobility among more recent cohorts of older adults.","Older adults are experiencing a period of life changes, one where planning for future needs becomes salient and where moving homes or communities may offer benefits across multiple dimensions. As households’ incomes decline during retirement and as they become empty nesters, moving can be a way to reduce housing expenditures, a way for homeowners to tap home equity, and an opportunity to live in destinations with better climate or other desirable amenities since commuting distance to jobs and the quality of local public schools are less relevant considerations. Current or anticipated declines in health should also motivate moves to accessible housing with low maintenance requirements and neighborhoods with suitable aging-friendly supports and services. At the same time, the literature finds strong preferences for proximity to family and friends in location and mobility decisions (Koşar et al., 2020, Büchel et al., 2020).====For older adults in particular, already having children living close by means that any potential benefits of moving have to be weighed against the potential loss of social support and practical assistance from their adult children. Prior research shows that support from nearby family members is associated with a variety of positive outcomes, including formal caregiving and assistance, social bonds, labor market outcomes, and delayed nursing home entry (Choi et al., 2021, van der Pers et al., 2015, Compton and Pollak, 2014). Given the substantial influence of social networks, local services, housing, and neighborhood characteristics on the well-being of older adults (Kan et al., 2020), it is important that we have a good understanding of the role of children in older adult mobility decisions, both to assess future caregiving needs and to facilitate effective targeting of resources and amenities in locations where older adults and their children want to live.====Our goal is to further the understanding of residential mobility decisions for older adults using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a large U.S. nationally-representative biennial panel dataset that follows households aged 50 + over time, and that provides geocoded family linkages. We focus on the influence of adult child proximity on the propensity to move, controlling for other factors that are known to influence residential mobility; including age, income, and personal life events such as retirement, declines in health, and partnership changes (Lee and Painter, 2014, Banks et al., 2012, Bradley and Longino, 2009, Calvo et al., 2009, Choi, 1996, Zhang et al., 2013; and many others).====We build on the existing literature in several ways. First, we exploit the rich information available in the HRS to focus on adult child proximity, while incorporating an extensive set of controls that have been shown in prior research to affect mobility. The family linkages and geocodes allow us to examine the relationship between child proximity or coresidence on the propensity to move of a broadly defined set of households spanning the 50 to 84 age range. While the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) has been more commonly used to study the general relationship between mobility and child proximity in the U.S. (e.g., Lee and Painter, 2014, Banks et al., 2012), the HRS has a larger, more nationally representative sample of older households, and offers the advantage of information specifically relevant to older households that we can use as controls in our analyses.==== Other studies that have used the HRS to study the influence of adult children on residential mobility have tended to focus on more narrowly defined samples. For example, Choi et al. (2014) and (2015) examine the mobility of older individuals with new onset of ADLs and cardiovascular events in 2004, and Zhang et al. (2013) limit their analysis to households aged 69 and above in 2000.====Second, with the long time period and span of birth years in the HRS, we can explore whether there has been a shift in behavior by cohorts over time. As demographers have noted, the baby boomer cohort is markedly differently from earlier generations in their higher rates of college completion and female labor force participation; lower rates of marriage, more divorce, and fewer children; as well as greater racial and ethnic diversity (Frey, 2010). It would therefore not be surprising if baby boomers behaved differently than earlier generations. Their greater independence compared with earlier generations may mean that they are less tied to the location of family members; on the other hand, their fewer numbers of children and higher shares of single households may mean stronger ties to each child so that proximity makes them less likely to move. Indeed, a recent review of research on predicting baby boomer care needs suggests not only a potential ‘care gap’ due to fewer members of younger generations, but also substantial uncertainty in future baby boomer outcomes due to these new ‘demographic and societal trends’ (Spillman et al., 2021). The large HRS sample size allows us to focus on this relatively younger group whose behavior will likely be more relevant for predicting the actions of older households to come.====Third, unlike much of the existing economics literature on the residential mobility of older households, we include renters as well as homeowners in our analyses. U.S. Census Bureau data show that homeownership rates have been falling since 1990, and not just among younger households. Goodman and Zhu (2021) argue that this downward trend is likely to continue as prime-aged households affected by the foreclosure crisis—in terms of losing their homes or failing the new, more stringent mortgage qualification requirements—age into retirement. Their housing tenure projections for 2020 to 2040 show a 21% increase in the number of renter households, with the increase predominantly consisting of older renters. Including renters is particularly important for understanding the behavior of Black and Hispanic households given their lower homeownership rates. Additionally, renters generally have lower levels of wealth and income compared with owners and thus may be more reliant on their adult children for current or anticipated caregiving needs.====We find that, after controlling for a host of other factors, having adult children nearby (up to a distance of 50 miles) is associated with a lower propensity to move, with the negative relationship being more pronounced if we define mobility as having moved at least 30 miles, or across metropolitan areas. We also find that the negative relationship is stronger for households with greater care needs, as captured by having existing or new ADL difficulties, and for households receiving help from an adult child. Renters are more sensitive to the location of adult children than homeowners in absolute terms, though not in percentage terms given their higher overall mobility rate. We also find that adult child proximity continues to be important for the baby boomer generation. While their sensitivity to very close proximity is less pronounced than earlier cohorts, a larger share of them have coresident adult children compared with earlier generations.====These results highlight the importance of adult child proximity in older adult mobility decisions, and suggest that communities need to plan for younger and older generations in tandem. Younger households tend to be more mobile, and may also choose to move to be closer to parents, reinforcing local social connections for older adults (Choi et al., 2021). These dynamics should put pressure on policymakers to ensure adequate local caregiving resources and to promote the creation of age-friendly infrastructure, housing, and local amenities.====The paper is organized as follows: in the next section we summarize the related literature and use that to inform our conceptual framework and empirical strategy in Section 3.

Older adults are generally more likely than younger ones to have a private health plan in Brazil, despite having lower income on average. In this study, we investigate the effects of having a private health plan on health expenditures, utilization and quality of care among Brazilian adults aged 50 and over who participate in the Brazilian ","Healthcare represents an important part of most households’ budget. A stylized fact is that older individuals in most countries tend to have greater healthcare needs and, depending on the level of health insurance and other social protections, are likely to have higher healthcare expenditures than households with younger members, all else equal (de Meijer et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2003, Zweifel et al., 2004).====In countries with a mix of public and private healthcare provision, understanding healthcare expenditures and utilization can be challenging. The members of the bloc of BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have all committed to achieving universal health coverage for their rapidly growing and aging populations (Jakovljevic, 2016, Marten et al., 2014, Rao et al., 2014). In comparison to other BRICS countries, Brazil had the highest total (9.6% of GDP in 2019) healthcare expenditures. It also had the second lowest share of public funding (40.7% of total healthcare expenditures), the second highest share of voluntary private insurance (28.7%) and the second lowest share of out-of-pocket spending (OOP) (24.9%) per capita (Jakovljevic et al., 2017). Brazil is also the only country in the bloc that constitutionally guarantees all citizens access to healthcare through a national health service (Sistema Único de Saúde or SUS in Portuguese), that provides comprehensive healthcare and most common medications free of charge at the point of service (Mendes, 2013, de Oliveira et al., 2022, Pinto Junior et al., 2014). In comparison, the Russian Federation spends 5.6% of GDP on healthcare, 61% of which is public, and only 5% of the population has voluntary private health insurance (Rao et al., 2014). Healthcare access is guaranteed through the Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund (Khalfin et al., 2019). In India, only 3% of GDP goes to health, one third of which is public. Over 60% of healthcare is financed out of pocket with only 6.6% of the population covered by voluntary private insurance (Khan et al., 2021). China spends about 5.6% of GDP on healthcare, 56% of which is public and a third of which is out-of-pocket (World Health Organization, 2021). About 12% of older adults had voluntary private health insurance (Jin et al., 2016). At 9% of GDP, South Africa has levels of overall healthcare expenditures similar to those of Brazil, with a slightly higher public share (59%). South Africa also has the lowest rate of out-of-pocket expenditures (5.7%) among BRICS countries (World Health Organization, 2021). About one-third of the South African population has voluntary private insurance (Day et al., 2021).====Despite access to a well-developed healthcare network provided by the SUS, many Brazilians elect to purchase voluntary private health plans. We intentionally use the term “private health plan” because there is no indemnity-type insurance in Brazil. Instead, private sector healthcare organizations (akin to U.S. Health Maintenance Organizations or HMOs) enroll individuals through monthly payments (premiums) and are required by law to provide all necessary health services to their enrolled population (Paim et al., 2011). In 2019, nearly 30% of Brazilians were covered by some type of private dental or health plan, representing approximately 60 million people (Souza Júnior et al., 2021). For some individuals, private health plans are a benefit obtained through their employer, but the majority purchase private health plans individually through monthly premiums paid out of pocket. Among workers in the formal labor market (47.4% of the total workforce), 30.7% pay premiums directly to private health plans (Souza Júnior et al., 2021). Health plans are highly concentrated among wealthier, more educated individuals living primarily in the capitals of the South and Southeast regions of the country (da Costa Filho et al., 2020, Malta et al., 2017, Pinto and Soranz, 2004). In 2019, the average health plan premium per capita was R$495, while the national monthly minimum wage was R$998, representing approximately US$100 and US$200, respectively (Souza Júnior et al., 2021). No other country with a universal healthcare system has such a low rate of public financing and such a high percentage of private spending (Castro et al., 2019).====Experts in the field of healthcare financing have pointed that out that economic growth will not be sufficient to ensure universal health coverage in the BRICS countries, especially given the rapid acceleration of aging in each country. (Chou et al., 2015, Rao et al., 2014, Tediosi et al., 2016). For these reasons, it is essential to understand the relationship between public and private sector healthcare financing and service provision among older adults in these different national contexts.====This paper explores differences in healthcare expenditures, utilization, and quality among older adults (defined as those aged 50 and over) who use the public and private sectors in Brazil. It is intended to stimulate discussion about the use of supplemental private health insurance within the context of a middle-income country with universal health coverage.","Private health insurance, healthcare spending and utilization among older adults: Results from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000305,24 June 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

We interview a representative sample of 801 Italian working women to assess their knowledge about pensions, financial issues and their own savings. The responses show that their knowledge and awareness of retirement planning is limited. We then run a randomized experiment to evaluate the effect of increased information regarding pensions on women’s awareness, knowledge, and behaviors. Women in the treated group are provided information in the form of three short online tutorials. A follow-up survey shows that these women become more interested and aware of pension schemes and retirement options after completing the tutorials and are more likely to be better informed and keener to obtain further information. When looking at changes in behavior, we find that treated women who are closer to retirement are more likely to believe that they would make different work-life decisions if they received specific pension information in a timely fashion. Middle-aged women are also more likely to have a supplementary pension fund if they are concerned about their ==== after retirement.","The world is rapidly ageing. Ageing poses serious financial pressures to the PAYG pension systems. To deal with them, in recent decades, many countries have switched from defined-benefit to defined-contribution pension schemes. In the new pension schemes, pension information becomes a crucial factor for workers in order to make rational retirement decisions. The ability to make optimal choices for work, savings and consumption may be hindered by a lack of knowledge, leading many workers to retire earlier and with lower pensions than if they had received better pension information. Since public pensions make up a large part of the total retirement income for many workers, it is important for governments to provide individuals with information about their public retirement benefits.====Gender differences are important in this ageing scenario. Women tend to live longer than men,==== meaning they need to save more, and they are likely to spend a larger part of their retirement in widowhood. Moreover, women tend to have less attachment to the labor market than men, with interrupted careers because of childbearing and potentially relatively lower earnings over their life cycle. With fewer available resources and higher life expectancies, women’s financial security after retirement is potentially more at risk than men’s one. As reported in Bettio et al., 2013, Tinios et al., 2015, Lis and Bonthuis, 2019, “pensions of women are substantially lower than those of men, by 27% on average across the EU but by >40% in a few European countries. This average gap is higher than the one for hourly earnings at 14%.” Fig. 1 reports the gender difference in pension coverage. At the same time, women appear to be less informed than men (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2008). In the absence of adequate information, gender differences risk being exacerbated by recent pension system reforms.====Italy represents a relevant case in this context. The gender pension gap at 35% is higher than the European average. Under the pressure of a very pronounced ageing process, the country has introduced a continuous series of reforms of the pension system. One of these was the country’s introduction in 1995 of a Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) scheme within the PAYG system, which tightly links pension entitlements to pension contributions. Within this new scheme, gender wage gaps over the worker’s career translate into gender pension gaps. The country’s 2011 pension reform sharply raised the retirement age to 67; this was a significant change for women, whose retirement age used to be five years lower than men’s. Such reforms have increased both individual responsibility and the complexity of the formulae that determine benefits (Fornero, Oggero, and Puglisi, 2019). Women, in particular, seem to be ill-informed when it comes to retirement planning. In this increasingly complex environment, basic financial knowledge has become a requisite for avoiding major mistakes and improving choices both in terms of labor supply and savings. In the current system, an employee’s future pension is determined by the individual’s labor history, as well as general economic (GDP growth) and demographic (general life expectancy) factors. Clear and transparent information is essential in this new framework, where the risk has shifted from the state to the worker. The gender divide could widen if women are not correctly informed (Elinder et al. 2020).====In this context, the European Commission has encouraged governments to develop a clear communication system to assist individuals with retirement planning. The Italian Social Security Institute (INPS) now sends workers annual statements of their estimated pension benefits. Since 2016, private-sector employees and the self-employed can go to the INPS website to get information about the date of retirement and predicted replacement rate, or to map out the various scenarios for different career patterns.====This paper fills an important gap in the literature on the role of financial and pension information. We analyze whether pension information channeled through tutorials==== can increase women’s knowledge and awareness about their future pensions and change their actual planning behavior for retirement.====To carry out our analysis we run a randomized experiment, specifically we interview a sample of 801 Italian working women representative of Italian working woman aged 25–64. In the initial questionnaire, we ask them to provide information about their personal characteristics, their family, working conditions, savings, and retirement. The data show a general lack of awareness among women about pensions and retirement planning. Then, to assess the role of information, we randomize our sample into two sub-groups. The first group (control group consisted of 388 women) receives no treatment, while the second group (treated group consisted of 413 women) completes three short tutorials providing information about the functioning of the pension system, the relationship between labor market dynamics and pensions, and basic elements of wealth accumulation and savings patterns. We then ask both groups to respond to a second questionnaire. By comparing the answers of the control and the treated group, we should be able to evaluate the impact of the information provided on women’s awareness, knowledge and savings plans. The results indicate that women in the treated group are more likely to have better knowledge of the pension system and to be interested in obtaining further information about pensions. Furthermore, pension information has an impact on the actual behavior, by making women in their accumulation life phase (middle age) save more specifically for retirement purposes. Our analysis shows to what extent pension information programs has an impact on women’s pension knowledge, their willingness to increase information on the subject and their active retirement planning behavior.====The paper is organized as follows: the next section reviews the literature, section 3 presents the main features of the Italian pension system, section 4 introduces data and descriptive statistics from our first wave of the questionnaire, section 5 describes the randomized experiment, section 6 presents the results of the experiment and empirical analysis and section 7 concludes.",Pension information and women’s awareness,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000299,24 June 2022,2022,Research Article,25.0

An important at-risk group comprises older employees who have worked in demanding jobs for many years. This group may be particularly negatively affected by the abolition of early retirement options. To measure differences in labor market reactions of employees in low- and high-demand jobs, we exploit the quasi-natural experiment of a cohort-specific pension reform that increased the early retirement age for women from 60 to 63 years. Based on a large administrative dataset, we use a regression-discontinuity approach to estimate the labor market reactions. Surprisingly, we find the same relative employment increase of about 25% for treated women who were exposed to low and to high job demand. For older women in demanding jobs, we also do not find substitution effects into unemployment, partial retirement, disability pension, or inactivity. Eligibility for the abolished early retirement option required high labor market attachment. Thus, we argue that this eligibility rule induced a positive selection of healthy workers into early retirement. We propose alternative policies that protect workers exposed to high job demand better against the negative consequences of being unable to reach their statutory retirement age in employment.","Early retirement options offer partial insurance for sub-groups of workers against negative consequences of being unable to continue working until the normal retirement age (NRA)==== (Börsch-Supan et al., 2022). An important group at risk of exiting employment early is employees exposed to high job demand==== for an extended time during their working life (Bundestag, 2006, Bundestag, 2014, Vermeer et al., 2016, Oecd, 2018). To target employees with high job demand, eligibility criteria for early retirement programs include a minimum number of contribution years (i.e., years in employment) or a high labor market attachment in the second half of the career.==== In addition to a long labor market history, eligibility for some early retirement options is tied to criteria that are related to potential job demand, such as being female==== or working in a demanding occupation.==== Finally, there are specific early retirement options for some demanding and hazardous occupations in most countries.==== For example, in many countries, pilots, flight controllers, police officers, miners, and judicial officers, as well as employees in fire departments or the military services have the option to, or in some instances must, retire earlier without deductions. These regulations are also indirectly tied to specific tenure thresholds because there are maximum age requirements (usually up to age 30) for these occupations.==== Workers in demanding jobs who are not able to reach the minimum work years for early retirement or have to quit employment earlier than the early retirement age (ERA) have to resort to social support programs. These programs typically have lower requirements with respect to previous work duration but offer lower transfers than early retirement programs. Examples are disability pensions or unemployment benefits, compare for example the international survey of programs for ill and disabled people by the OECD (2010).====Workers in more demanding jobs are more likely to retire early from employment (Blekesaune and Solem, 2005). Therefore, abolishing early retirement options may particularly negatively affect employees who are exposed to high job demand (Vermeer et al., 2016).==== Instead of extending employment, they may substitute early retirement with social support programs or inactivity that bridges the time until retirement benefits can be drawn (Chirikos and Nestel, 1991). These substitutes for early retirement usually incur large financial disadvantages (Mazzonna and Peracchi, 2017).====In this work, we test empirically whether employees in demanding jobs extend old-age employment less than employees in less demanding jobs when an early retirement option is abolished. We use a pension reform in Germany that abolished an early retirement option for women, the pension for women. This retirement option granted the earliest possible pension access at age 60 for women with at least 15 employment years. Its abolition increased the ERA by 3 years to age 63. We exploit the sharp discontinuity in the ERA between cohorts using a regression discontinuity framework.==== We select the sub-group of women born 1 year before and after the reform cut off (January 1, 1952) who fulfilled the eligibility requirements for the pension for women. We estimate the causal impact of the pension reform on old-age employment or partial retirement, unemployment, marginal employment, and inactivity. We differentiate the labor market reactions to the pension reform by levels of job demand. We measure physical and psychosocial job demands in occupations using the Job Exposure Matrices (JEM) suggested by Kroll, 2011, Kroll, 2015 matched to the three-digit Classification of Occupations (KldB-2010) in the last job before retirement (see Brussig, 2016, Mazzonna and Peracchi, 2017, Rijs et al., 2014 for similar empirical approaches). Occupation-level indicators of job demand are less likely to be influenced by preferences for work and leisure than subjective information about job demand reported by individual workers (Blekesaune and Solem, 2005).====The reform had the same employment effects for women in occupations with high and low job demand. Employment between 60 and 63 years increased by about 25% in the 1952 treatment birth cohort compared with the 1951 control birth cohort, irrespective of the level of physical or psychosocial job demand. There was no increased program substitution of affected women in both job demand groups. Consequently, there was no stronger effect on unemployment, partial retirement, disability pension, or higher inactivity for women with higher job demand after the reform.====Contrary to its intention, the pension for women did not offer an early retirement option for older workers with high job demand who were unable to work until their NRA. One explanation for this finding is the strong attachment to the labor market required for this early retirement option. As a result, the group of women eligible for early retirement comprised healthy workers who self-selected into jobs with high job demand (Modrek and Cullen, 2012). We present several indicators for our healthy worker hypothesis in the discussion section. One indication is that about double the share of women in less demanding jobs were eligible for the pension for women compared with women in demanding jobs. Many employees in demanding jobs who were not eligible for early retirement had to take the disability pension as a bridge option into retirement (Börsch-Supan et al., 2022).====We contribute to the large and growing literature on the labor market effects of pension reforms that increase the ERA of the affected employee groups (Ardito and d’Errico, 2018, Atalay and Barrett, 2015, Cribb and Emmerson, 2018, Geyer and Welteke, 2021, Geyer et al., 2020, Manoli and Weber, 2016, Oguzoglu et al., 2020, Staubli and Zweimüller, 2013). These studies exploit the quasi-experimental design of reforms, which allows causal effects to be identified using evaluation methods. In general, these studies find that increasing the ERA has large employment effects and small substitution effects into unemployment benefits or other social support systems. Our paper shows that these results also extend to the group of older employees in demanding jobs who were expected to suffer particularly from the abolition of early retirement options.====Our study also contributes to the literature focusing on heterogeneity in retirement entries by occupational characteristics (Blekesaune and Solem, 2005, Chirikos and Nestel, 1991, Giesecke, 2018, Hayward et al., 1998, Hurd and McGarry, 1993, Plomp et al., 2019). Most papers found no or small associations between work demand and retirement behavior (for example, see the literature review in van den Berg et al., 2010).==== Studies have mainly estimated structural models of the relationship between work demand and retirement. Job demand influences retirement, but it also may itself depend on the planned retirement age. Thus, previous papers must assume that all factors related to job choice and labor market behavior in old age could be controlled for (Henseke, 2011). This paper is one of the first contributions to use quasi-experimental variation for identification. We can control for otherwise unobserved heterogeneity between labor demand groups and the endogeneity of the choice of labor demand. We also differentiate between retirement via early retirement programs for a selected group of employees and retirement via social support programs that are open to all employees who are unable to work until the NRA.====The paper is organized as follows.

After controlling for time-invariant heterogeneity using panel time diaries, we find that older caregivers reported reduced time allocated to each domain fairly evenly overall. However, women showed a stronger associated decline in personal care and labor supply while men showed stronger declines in time devoted to home production. Gendered differences are more pronounced with intensive and non-spousal care. Results highlight time–cost differentials that could be driving observed gender gaps in health and labor market outcomes among unpaid caregivers. The study also underscores the serious endogeneity concerns between caregiving and broader time allocation patterns and highlights the need for additional research to establish the causal effects of caregiving.","A majority of Americans will provide unpaid care at older ages. Between 2017 and 2018 alone, over 22% of women and 18% of men aged 55 or older provided unpaid eldercare to a relative, friend, or neighbor (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). While receiving less attention in the literature, grandchild care has also grown substantially over the past few decades (Meyer et al., 2017). With the continued aging of the U.S. population, demand for unpaid adult and child care services will likely continue to rise.==== While caregivers provide a socially valuable service, caregiving is a time intensive task and must be met by other time allocation adjustments on the part of the care provider. These time trade-offs have significant implications for the health and well-being of caregivers. Understanding time allocation decisions is therefore critical for maintaining adequate supply of care services and promoting social welfare more broadly.====In this study, we use panel time-diaries to better understand how older women and men reallocate their time in response to providing unpaid care to adults and/or children. Until recently, research has focused on estimating cross-sectional correlations between unpaid care, labor supply, health, and time allocated to household chores and leisure (Henz, 2004, Trukeschitz et al., 2013, Bauer and Sousa-Poza, 2015, Kalenkoski, 2017, Moussa, 2019, Burch et al., 2019, Stanfors et al., 2019). However, it is widely argued that cross-sectional estimates are strongly confounded by endogeneity (Heitmueller, 2007, Kalenkoski, 2017, Fischer and Müller, 2020). For example, if those already spending more time on household chores select into caregiving, there may a spurious correlation between caregiving and time spent in wider home production. Importantly, use of panel data allows us to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity across individuals and estimate a more robust association between unpaid care and broader time allocations.====Due to the lack of readily available panel time-diaries, studies that have used longitudinal data-sets to capture unobserved heterogeneity with caregiving have focused on labor market outcomes (Heitmueller, 2007, Van Houtven et al., 2013, Truskinovsky and Maestas, 2018, Fahle and McGarry, 2018). These studies have generally pointed to a negative relationship between caregiving and labor supply, with some evidence of stronger labor market trade-offs for women than men. However, to our knowledge, there are no longitudinal studies that estimate the association of caregiving with time use outside of labor market activity or in terms of the trade-offs between caregiving, leisure, and home production. Moreover, little is understood of how the reallocation of time differs between men and women who take up care responsibilities. Therefore, a broader understanding of opportunity costs of caregiving and gender differences has been missing.====Our time-diary data come from the Disability and Use of Time Survey (DUST) collected in 2009 and 2013. Controlling for permanent unobserved heterogeneity, we estimate the association between caregiving and work, home production, personal care, and leisure activities overall and by gender. We first analyze the time trade-offs in daily activities with a continuous measure of caregiving collected over two 24-hour periods. We then classify high and low care intensities to assess non-linear associations and examine care for a spouse separately from child or parental care. Our research makes two primary contributions to the existing literature: (i) we use longitudinal data to estimate the association between care provision and the allocation of time between work, home production, leisure, and personal care, thus broadening our understanding of the opportunity costs of caregiving, (ii) we present results by gender to illuminate the mechanisms driving gender gaps in health and employment outcomes among unpaid carers.====Most of the research on caregiving by older adults has focused on labor market and/or health outcomes (see reviews by Pinquart and Sörensen, 2003, Pinquart and Sörensen, 2007, Bauer and Sousa-Poza, 2015, Kim et al., 2017, Spann et al., 2020). Only a few studies have explicitly examined the differential impact of caregiving on men and women. The evidence on gendered labor market effects are mixed. For the U.S., Van Houtven et al. (2013) estimate wage penalties, early retirement, and reduced hours only for women, but significant participation effects only for men providing personal care. In Britain, Carmichael and Charles (2003) found larger participation effects on females among those caring at least 10 h a week. Other studies have generally found labor market effects to be similar across genders (Lilly et al., 2010, Nguyen and Connelly, 2014, Stanfors et al., 2019). Grandparenthood has also been shown to be negatively related to employment in the U.S., again with mixed evidence of differential impact on women and men (Rupert and Zanella, 2018, Asquith, 2018, Lumsdaine and Vermeer, 2015). In contrast to the mixed evidence on labor market outcomes, most studies identify stronger negative effects on women’s mental health, including stress, depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction (Yee and Schulz, 2000, Raschick and Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004, Bookwala, 2009). Pinquart and Sörensen (2006) find that these gender differences can be partly explained by women providing longer and more intense adult care.====Women are far more likely overall to provide care and to spend time in home production than men (Ferrant and Thim, 2019). At the same time, evidence on the effect of caregiving on home production is sparse. Stanfors et al. (2019) find a positive correlation between time spent in caregiving and home production in Canada, Sweden, and the UK, with no significant gender differences. However, the study is based on cross-sectional observation which raises endogeneity concerns. By exploiting longitudinal data, we provide a more robust estimate of the effect of caregiving on time devoted to home production. In an attempt to better understand the effect of caregiving on caregiver’s health and productivity, we also differentiate personal care (e.g. sleep) from all other forms of leisure in all our analyses. We anticipate personal care could have strong ‘respite’ effects, thus improving the quality of care along with the well-being and health of the caregiver.====Finally, there is some evidence that the effects of caregiving differ by type of care recipient. For example, health burdens appear to be higher when providing care to a spouse than to a parent (Pinquart and Sörensen, 2003, Raschick and Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004). Hypothesized explanations include spousal caregivers being older themselves and facing more intensive responsibilities than parental caregivers. We complement these proposed mechanisms by examining the differential association of spousal, parental, and child caregiving on overall time allocation by gender.====While DUST data provide a unique chance to analyze these important trade-offs, it warrants mentioning at the outset that there are important limitations to our study. First, the sample size is small—946 total observations. With this in mind, we attempt to provide statistical test results where appropriate, and are transparent on what general conclusions can (and cannot) be drawn from our analyses. Second, we do not control for time-varying selection into caregiving. This could result in bias in interpretation of our estimates as causal effects. As this is a particular concern for work hours given the timing of retirement in the DUST sample, we also conduct analyses conditioning on labor supply. This serves to minimize any residual bias due to retirement for time allocated to home production, leisure, and personal care. However, we cannot fully control for unobserved time-varying characteristics. Thus, we view our findings as pointing towards the direction of bias in cross-sectional estimates, but we call for additional research into the robust causal effects of caregiving on time-use as additional data sources become available.",Opportunity costs of unpaid caregiving: Evidence from panel time diaries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000196,4 May 2022,2022,Research Article,27.0

To isolate exogenous variation in health over time, the analysis exploits the sharp decline in cardiovascular disease mortality across states that originated from medical advances in the treatment and prevention of these diseases after 1960. The results demonstrate that health improvements contributed to rising income inequality through mechanisms related to education.","Over the twentieth century medical advances led to a substantial increase in life expectancy in the United States. This rise created an opportunity for increasing human capital investment, higher savings, and thus economic growth (Bloom et al., 2003, Cervellati et al., 2017, Hansen and Strulik, 2017, Kotschy, 2021). While there is ample empirical work on the long-run effects of health dynamics on economic development, little research concentrates on the potential consequences of these dynamics for economic inequality.====A link between health and inequality is conceivable through education. Health improvements increase an individual’s survival probability at a given age of the life cycle, which raises the expected benefits of education relative to its costs and thus promotes educational attainment and lifetime wealth (Ben-Porath, 1967, Cervellati and Sunde, 2013, Sánchez-Romero et al., 2016, Strulik and Werner, 2016). Higher educational attainment, in turn, widens the income dispersion if technical change is skill-biased (Acemoglu, 1998, Acemoglu and Autor, 2011), if earnings differentials between skilled and unskilled work grow (Eckstein and Nagypal, 2004, Heathcote et al., 2010), or if earnings become an increasingly convex function of educational attainment (Lemieux, 2006). Population aging thanks to increased longevity further reinforces the inequalities in education, employment, and earnings, which tend to accumulate over the life cycle (Ashenfelter and Rouse, 1999, OECD, 2017).====This paper empirically examines whether and to what extent improvements in population health impacted income inequality in the United States over the period 1960–2000. The analysis exploits variation in health improvements that originated from medical advances in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases starting in the 1960s. These advances contributed two-thirds of the substantial decline in cardiovascular disease mortality between 1960 and 2000, which accounted for 70 percent of the rise in life expectancy over this period (Cutler, 2004, p. 53; Cutler et al. 2006, p. 104). Because cardiovascular diseases are much more common among adults than among children, the medical advances predominantly boosted adult health. To isolate exogenous variation in health over time, the analysis extends the identification strategies used by Hansen and Strulik (2017) and Kotschy (2021) to the consideration of income inequality. Specifically, the empirical model combines state-level variation in cardiovascular disease mortality in 1960 with the unanticipated medical advances in the treatment and prevention of these diseases thereafter to predict the mortality decline for each state. The model then uses the predicted mortality decline as an instrument for changes in adult life expectancy to estimate the effect of health on income inequality in a long-difference specification.====The results show that health improvements impacted income inequality: A 1-year increase in life expectancy at 30 raised the Gini coefficient of pre-tax incomes by 1.8 points. In total, the health improvements between 1960 and 2000 accounted for an increase of 5.3 points in the income Gini coefficient. For comparison, this coefficient varied between 38 and 53 points over this period, with increases of about 10 points in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York. The results suggest that increased college education, an increased ratio of white-collar to blue-collar work, and, to a lesser extent, changes in labor supply were mechanisms through which health affected inequality.====These results provide novel evidence that population health can be an important determinant of economic inequality through mechanisms related to education. This evidence extends descriptive work by Deaton and Paxson, 1994, Deaton and Paxson, 1998 on the link between health and inequality. Moreover, it provides support for theoretical predictions that rising college education has fueled income inequality through skill-biased technical change (Acemoglu, 1998, Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). Finally, the evidence confirms widening earnings differentials between white-collar and blue-collar work (Eckstein and Nagypal, 2004, Heathcote et al., 2010).",Health improvements impact income inequality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000184,26 April 2022,2022,Research Article,28.0

However, there is little research exploring the potentially important interactions between the two. This paper addresses this gap in the literature and provides a more robust understanding of retirement behavior by examining the transition from full-time work to fully retired among dual earning couples, which we call joint retirement trajectories. We analyze 12 waves of the Health and Retirement Study to map out the distribution of potential pathways that couples undertake when retiring. We aimed to present the fullest picture possible of joint retirement trajectories under the hypothesis that if there were a common, dominant, or typical path, it would emerge. Instead, the consistent finding is variation across couples in the length, sequence, leader, concordance, and labor supply in the move from full-time work to fully retired. Using simple heuristics to classify joint retirement trajectories allows us to gain perspective in the rarity of full simultaneous retirement and motivates future research into the joint use of partial retirement by couples.","Research into retirement behavior has established two contemporary features. First, that retirement is not a discrete, one-time change in status but often a transition that includes partial (also called phased or gradual) retirement (Maestas 2010). Second, that for couples, retirement is often a joint decision, rather than two individual decisions (Coile, 2004a, Banks et al., 2010). In this paper, we investigate the interaction of these two features and map out the joint retirement trajectories of dual-earning couples in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We are the first paper to concurrently document these two established retirement features.====Mapping the sequence of retirement transitions of two workers has challenges. Primarily, the state space of the trajectory—two workers each with a retirement status over numerous waves of observation—has the potential to become very large, rendering the number of potential paths so numerous that patterns in the data are difficult to detect. To place bounds on the analysis and to narrow the scope given the available sample size, we balance precision with informativeness by simplifying the number of states. Further, since our work is the first to explore these joint work-to-retirement trajectories, we consider retirement as broadly and objectively as possible.====We use hours worked to create three mutually exclusive and exhaustive work states for each spouse at each point in time: working full-time, partially retired, and fully retired. An individual retirement trajectory is defined as the path from full-time work to full-time retirement. A joint retirement trajectory is defined as the path from both partners working full-time to both partners retired full-time.====It is important to note that our three states could span both intentional reductions in work, such as reducing hours at a current employer or a new, part-time job, as well as unplanned reduced attachment to the labor force, such as job loss, poor health, or caregiving that move workers to part-time or not working. While more detailed states could be considered, this schema allows us to simplify the set of states so that our trajectories can capture the breadth of all the joint trajectories while still being interpretable. In addition, the goal of this paper is to map the joint retirement process, not necessarily explain it.====Indeed, our primary contribution is to show the extent to which the joint retirement trajectories of couples vary. While our definitions are designed to reduce the number of possible states, we find no single path common enough to earn the moniker of “typical” joint retirement patterns. We use three primary methods to explore if there is a typical joint retirement path or pattern.====First, we show the progression of the joint retirement trajectories through our defined states. A pattern here would show similarities in timing ==== sequence of joint retirement, such as both partners reducing to partial retirement in the same wave; we do not find one. Second, we use heuristics to classify the trajectories into mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories based on commonalities that are not necessarily timed or sequenced in unison. We used four heuristic schemas, each focusing on a different aspect of the joint sequence: concordance (if the partners are in the same retirement state); first mover (who reduces work first, the husband or wife); initial status (if the move away from full-time work is partial retirement or full-time retirement); and backtracking (if there are increases in work). Again, we find that there is variation in retirement patterns and no primary path among any of the heuristics.====Finally, we regress the heuristic categorization on observable characteristics of the couple in multinomial logit models, allowing us to characterize which types of trajectories are most commonly associated with different characteristics. Our results cannot point to causal explanations for the differences in joint retirement patterns but provide intuition and motivation for future work.====Next, we discuss our research in the context of the retirement literature. We then describe our data, and the retirement trajectories observed in our data, with a focus on the simple researcher defined heuristics that we use to classify trajectories. We then use multinomial logit models to predict the researcher defined categories. We end with a discussion of the effects of truncation of retirement trajectories.",Pathways to Retirement Among Dual Earning Couples,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X22000172,8 April 2022,2022,Research Article,29.0

We also extend the basic model to account for countries at all income levels and present a demography opportunity set that describes all the combinations of fertility rates, ====, and parental time shares.","The period from 1960 to 2018 witnesses a decline in the fertility rates of high-income countries.==== As shown in Fig. 1, the average fertility rate of high-income countries was about 3 in 1960 but dropped below the replacement level in 1976. Although the decline had become modest since 1990, the trend continued. In 2018, the average fertility rate was about 1.6 children per woman.====The fertility rate below the replacement level indicates a lasting population shrinkage in the long run and fundamentally impacts the economy. Although the governments of high-income countries have been encouraging the young to increase the fertility rate, the effects are insignificant (Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017). For now, after leaving the Malthus trap of low income and high fertility rate, the high-income countries enter the opposite featuring high income and low fertility rate (Gori and Sodini, 2021). How to explain the current low fertility rate in high-income countries as well as the historical dynamics?====In this paper, we propose that the rising parental time is a key factor in shaping the stylized fact. Here, parental time is the time actively spent by parents on accompanying children. The importance of parental time is noticed by Becker (1992) and Galor and Weil (2000). Parental time comes into modeling as a fraction of time, which is recognized as an important but fixed child-rearing cost both in the Barro–Becker modeling framework (Becker and Barro, 1988, Barro and Becker, 1989, Becker et al., 1990) and in the following unified growth theory (Galor and Weil, 2000, Galor and Moav, 2002, Moav, 2005).====However, we argue that the fixed-parameter setting is not consistent with the empirical data. The data from the Multinational Time Use Survey [MTUS, Fisher et al. (2019)] show that parental time has been increasing since the 1960s (see Fig. 2), and this fact is documented in the literature (Aguiar and Hurst, 2007, Guryan et al., 2008). To this end, we construct an indicator named the parental time share to denote the fraction of time spent on child-rearing rather than on working (see Section “Parental time” for a detailed explanation). With the data from the MTUS, we show that the parental time share is not fixed but is increasing over time. Therefore, this study suggests that this fixed parameter should be endogenized as a choice variable, and the parental time share that we construct can serve to link the household time use data with the modeling.====In particular, we follow the Barro–Becker modeling framework and adopt a modified quantitative model from de Silva and Tenreyro (2020) to illustrate the role of the parental time share increase in shaping the demographic changes. The modification is twofold. First, the family planning mechanism in de Silva and Tenreyro (2020) is omitted to match the case of high-income countries. Second, the parental time share, which is assumed to provide psychic satisfaction for adults (Becker, 1960), is introduced in the model as an endogenous variable. Then, the utility-maximizing behavior of households delivers the interactions of three important demographic variables: the fertility rate, the human capital investment (measured by schooling years), and the parental time share.====This paper derives both analytical and quantitative results from the model. The analytical results show that the fertility rate declines and the human capital investment increases with the parental time share. The increasing parental time share converges to a steady state determined by structural parameters, which also determines the declining fertility rate. Then, with the calibrated parameters for high-income countries, the quantitative results match the demographic dynamics revealed by the empirical data, including the fertility rate, the human capital investment, and the parental time share. Therefore, both the theoretical and numerical results confirm the essential role of the parental time share in affecting the decline in the fertility rate and the rise of the human capital investment.====The intuition of our primary results can be explained as follows. The accumulation of human capital triggers the well-known quantity–quality tradeoff, enhancing the human capital investment and reducing the number of children. The reduced number of children allows parents to increase the parental time share, so as to establish a close parent–child relationship and maximize parents’ utility. The increased parental time share on one hand substitutes for the number of children from the perspective of parents’ utility and on the other hand implies a rise in child-rearing cost per child, which in turn lowers the fertility rate below the replacement level as observed in high-income countries. The entire process reinforces itself as human capital continuously accumulates. When human capital approaches infinity, the fertility rate and the parental time share are determined by household preference parameters only, whereas the human capital investment is determined by both household preference parameters and the cost of schooling.====Further, we extend the basic model to account for all income levels. To this end, we adopt a general human capital production function [modified from Galor and Weil (2000) and de Silva and Tenreyro (2020)] and assume that caring for multiple children causes tiredness and reduces marginal utility. The general human capital production function allows for the inclusion of each income group as proper subsets, and the assumption of caring for multiple children leading to disutility captures the case of low-income countries with high fertility rates. The extended model exhibits all the possible combinations of three demographic variables: the fertility rate, the human capital investment, and the parental time share. These combinations can be viewed as a demography opportunity set to guide policy making across different income groups.==== We also conduct a numerical exercise with the calibrated parameters, and the results roughly fit the data of all income levels. Thus, our work provides a simple but unified modeling framework to analyze the demographic changes for countries at any income level.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Assessment of the health care needs of the aged is problematic due to the ordered categorical nature of self-reported health status, since results based upon arbitrary attribution of cardinal measure to ordinal categories are ambiguous due to scale and weighting issues. Here scale independent methods, particularly useful in multilateral, multidimensional analysis with ordered outcomes for measurement and comparison of treatment group ==== are proposed and exemplified in a study of poor health–loneliness and ageing relationships in China. Substantial differences in health and loneliness experiences across age, gender, urban–rural, and partner status divides are revealed, highlighting the exceptional health care needs of the aged in particular areas.","The relationship between health and loneliness, and the ageing process is a major factor in the wellbeing of the elderly (Gerst-Emerson and Jayawardhana, 2015, Ong et al., 2016, World Health Organization, 2015). A synthesis of the literature (Pinquart and Sörensen, 2003) identified some other factors, including gender, marital status and location which impinge on the relationship, all of which have been substantiated in more recent large-scale studies of older adults (Nicolaisen and Thorsen, 2014). Privately provided health care places a significant economic burden on the aged which, under state provision is assumed by government. In either case, the extent of the exceptional health care needs confronting an ageing population requires quantification in terms of the levels and variation in health and loneliness in the context of these other factors. However, the subjective nature of self reported health and loneliness outcomes, presents some empirical challenges.====Since (Likert, 1932), subjective wellbeing measurement using ordered categorical response outcomes has frequently relied upon assignment of cardinal scales to ordinal categories (De Jong Gierveld and Van Tilburg, 2006, Russell, 1996). Allison and Foster (2004) critiqued the practice, and introduced a spread around the median measure as a compromise, which in turn fostered a number of univariate bipolarization-type inequality measures (Apouey, 2007, Apouey et al., 2020, Cowell and Flachaire, 2017, Jenkins, 2021). More generally, Kahneman and Krueger (2006) highlighted the arbitrariness and ambiguity of such assignments, Schröder and Yitzhaki (2017) derived conditions under which the ambiguity imparted by the scale dependency of most summarizing statistics==== would not prevail and conjectured that they would seldom obtain in practice, which was confirmed in a variety of examples in Bond and Lang (2019).==== The issue is pertinent whenever ordered categorical information is used as a proxy for a latent continuous variate and is exacerbated in multidimensional environments involving arbitrarily assigned dimension weights for aggregation purposes (Klugman et al., 2011). Moreover, Carneiro et al. (2003) question the use of subgroup conditional means as comparison instruments in treatment effects models, since they can cast a veil of ignorance over more substantive distributional differences, a concern that is amplified in the face of distributions whose variates have no real cardinal measure.====Responses to questions like “====” are fundamentally ordinal (Ware and Gandek, 1998). While each successive state is to be preferred to its predecessor, numbers attached to each such as ==== for the purpose of analysis confer an unwarranted and arbitrary constant marginal benefit to a one category improvement. There is no reason to think that “====” has twice the hedonic value of “====”, the number allocation ==== conferring a diminishing marginal benefit to a one category improvement, constitute an equally valid, but nonetheless arbitrary, monotonic increasing ordering.====Numbers assigned to categories have the status of assumptions about relative values with different assumptions usually resulting in materially different and ambiguous results. Hence, frequently employed location and scale measures, and the weighted sums thereof, employed in multidimensional analyses in artificially cardinalized ordinal environments are equally arbitrary in nature, and not necessarily robust to any other arbitrarily chosen, but equally valid, cardinalizing assumptions. Measures that reflect subjective wellbeing differences between groups in many dimensions which are not scale dependent, can mitigate the problem. While they will not completely avoid the ambiguity issues that are intrinsic to the data, they take the arbitrariness of scaling choice out of the analysis, provide orderings that are independent of any chosen scale and facilitate quantification of the potential for ambiguity.====Here measures reflecting subjective differences between groups in many dimensions that are not scale dependent are introduced and exemplified in a study of health, loneliness, and ageing in 21st century China. In the following, Section “Comparison instruments and their extensions” outlines some basic multilateral comparison instruments required for the analysis of ordered categorical data, and considers their extension to multivariate and higher order measurement environments. The proposed techniques are applied to survey data drawn from the 2013 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in Section “Empirical results”. (The artificial scaling problems associated with this data set are illustrated in Appendix “Problems with cardinalising ordinal categories”.)

Using a nationally representative sample from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), we compare mortality risks in ","This paper studies the association between alcohol consumption and mortality and disability at older ages, using nationally representative Chinese data. This issue has been especially controversial since the very influential study by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD). The study of GBD 2016 Alcohol Collaborators (2018) concluded that the level of alcohol consumption that minimized harm was zero. This finding stands in contrast to many studies that distinguish between heavy and light drinking, and find that light drinking is not associated with poor health. In an era in which increasing longevity globally brings policy challenges that might be mitigated by improvements in healthy life expectancy, new evidence on the links between drinking and health has special relevance. It is given additional significance by the current UN sanctioned “Decade of Healthy Aging”, in which behavior plays an important role (World Health Organization, 2020).====There is little agreement in the literature about the health implications of moderate alcohol consumption.==== In contrast to the landmark GBD study, numerous studies have found that drinking in moderation is associated with lower mortality. Light to moderate drinkers have been found to have lower all-cause mortality than non-drinkers (for example, Di Castelnuovo et al., 2006, Jayasekara et al., 2014, Poikolainen, 1995). Similar findings emerge when specific disease categories are examined. Ronksley et al. (2011) found light alcoholic intake was associated with lower mortality from cardiovascular disease, and some studies documented negative relations between moderate alcohol intake and many adverse health outcomes, such as stroke (Reynolds et al., 2003), coronary heart disease (Corrao et al., 2000), and myocardial infarction (Leong et al., 2014). Combining these findings with the damaging impacts of alcohol abuse generates a J-shaped curve between alcohol consumption and mortality (Costanzo et al., 2019). Other studies have found insignificant associations between low-volume alcohol intake and mortality (Goulden, 2016, Stockwell et al., 2016, Wood et al., 2018). Our research adds to this line of literature, suggesting generally reduced risks of mortality among older current drinkers relative to lifelong abstainers.====Turning to China specifically, the literature linking alcohol and mortality is surprisingly sparse. This is notable given the wide and longstanding acceptance of alcohol consumption there (Cochrane et al., 2003), and the studies which have been carried out mostly focus on single cities. Yuan et al. (1997) conducted a prospective cohort study of middle-aged Chinese males in Shanghai. They found reductions in overall mortality and mortality from ischaemic heart disease among light-to-moderate ever-drinkers compared with never-drinkers. They also noted the damages of heavy drinking, which was associated with increased risks of death from cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, hepatic cirrhosis, and stroke.====Xu et al. (2007) reached similar results for Chinese males in Shanghai. Former drinkers in their study had a higher risk of overall mortality than lifelong abstainers, while current drinkers had a significantly lower risk. Light drinkers had a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular diseases, whereas heavy drinkers had increased mortality, particularly cancer-related deaths. Compared to non-drinkers and heavy drinkers, Zhang et al. (2021) showed light-to-moderate drinkers in the city of Tangshan had lower risks of all-cause, cardiovascular disease attributed, and cancer-attributed mortality. The comparison between non-drinkers and heavy drinkers was generally inconclusive.====The only national China-based study of which we are aware found an elevated risk of all-cause mortality among current drinkers than non-drinkers (Yang et al., 2012). The mortality difference between light drinkers and non-drinkers was insignificant, while the risk among heavy drinkers was significantly higher. However, their analysis sample excluded those with prior diseases at baseline, which might bias the estimated relation if non-drinkers were excluded disproportionately.====The scanty evidence available for China and the lack of consensus on the issue more generally, as noted above, suggest an urgent need for further investigation into the association between alcohol intake and mortality. Estimated life expectancies in total and in various health states at retirement ages by drinking status could be critical inputs into the estimation of medical expenditure, long-term care requirements, and pension provision.====With the primary focus of the paper on the relationship between alcohol consumption and life expectancies, our findings also contribute to our understanding of the significance of alcohol consumption for population health. In the existing literature, there are only a few studies estimating healthy life expectancies by drinking status (Brønnum-Hansen et al., 2007, Klijs et al., 2011, Li et al., 2020, Mehta and Myrskylä, 2017, O’Doherty et al., 2016). Most of these studies examined a set of lifestyle factors using data from western countries, while we focus specifically on alcohol consumption. This narrowed focus enables us to provide more details. Analyzing data from a nationally representative sample in China, our estimation results also extend the current literature to a low-resource setting with rapid population aging.====Finally, we add to the burgeoning research interest on healthy life expectancies in developing countries. Compared with the prevalence-based and widely used Sullivan method, the multi-state model employed here describes health changes in the population with fewer restrictive assumptions (Laditka and Hayward, 2002). Previous studies in China mostly documented states and trends in healthy life expectancies (Gu et al., 2009, Hanewald et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2019, Luo et al., 2016, Zimmer et al., 2015) or emphasized the role of socioeconomic factors (Hou et al., 2019, Huang et al., 2019, Jiao, 2019, Zeng et al., 2001). Among the most closely related studies using data from China, Tian et al. (2011) noted a longer disability-free life expectancy among never smokers; and Hou et al. (2020) identified dietary patterns, mental activities, and social activities as critical predictors of cognitively healthy life expectancy.====With this background in mind, this study estimates all-cause mortality, total life expectancy, and disability-free life expectancy by age and drinking status for older Chinese males. We use a nationally representative sample from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Using Cox regression analyses, we are among the first to estimate age-specific mortality hazards associated with alcohol consumption. Compared with lifelong abstainers, we find generally reduced mortality among current male drinkers. Hazard ratios of currently drinking relative to abstinence were found to be significantly smaller than one among those aged between 68 and 87 years.====We then apply the interpolated Markov chain (IMaCh) approach to calculate total and disability-free life expectancies. Describing age-specific transition probabilities between disability-free, disabled, and death for each drinking status, we provide some first evidence on the dynamic forces underlying the relationship between drinking and mortality. Current drinkers were found to have reduced mortality conditional on being disability-free and increased incidence of recovery from disability relative to lifelong abstainers.====After accounting for socioeconomic factors, our estimated total life expectancy at age 65 was 18.0 (95% CI: 17.4–18.6) years among current male drinkers, significantly longer than the 16.3 (95% CI: 15.6–17.0) years for lifelong abstainers. Current male drinkers at age 65 could expect to live about 16.1 (95% CI: 15.6–16.7) years without disability, whereas the estimated disability-free life expectancy was 14.2 (95% CI: 13.6–14.9) years among lifelong abstainers.

The proposed approach helps to explain differing findings on the relationship between age and subjective well-being reported in a series of studies based on cross-sectional and/or longitudinal panel data. We find empirical support for a wave-like pattern of subjective well-being over the life course. In contrast to the existing literature, our results point to significantly different life cycle patterns for the within- and between-person results. While the between-person results show robust turning points of age around the mid-40s and 90s, the within-person findings indicate that subjective well-being is rather stable between age 16 and 23 and then approaches a local maximum at age 75.

Moreover, we do not find support of a U-shape association between subjective well-being and age. This finding holds even if we restrict the sample to those survey respondents aged 18–65 years, indicating that the age-well-being relationship is more complex than a U-shape would predict. A series of additional robustness tests corroborate our main findings.","Over the last few decades, the relationship between age and individual well-being==== has been the subject of intense discussion in various research fields, including economics, gerontology, psychology, and sociology. Researchers from the different fields have provided a range of theoretical explanations for this relationship and have tested them empirically. The functional relationships found between well-being and age in empirical studies are manifold. The findings range from U-shaped and inverted U-shaped relationships to linear or cubic relationships or no relationship at all. Moreover, theoretical explanations can be found for virtually any empirical relationship. The numerous theoretical explanations arise from the multidimensionality of channels by which age might affect subjective well-being (SWB). Theoretical models range from consumption-smoothing (Fisher, 1930, Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954) and hyperbolic discounting (Frederick et al., 2002) models in economics to models of set point theory (Diener and Lucas, 1999, Lucas, 2007) and the hedonic treadmill (Kahneman, 1999) in psychology, to the satisfaction paradox (Mroczek and Kolarz, 1998) and socio-emotional selectivity theory (Munsey, 2007, Charles and Carstensen, 2009) in gerontology.====A striking characteristic of the empirical literature is the persistence of differing findings on the functional form found. Most studies using====cross-sectional data and analyzing the between-person variation of age find a U-shaped relationship, with a low in middle adulthood (Blanchflower, 2021, Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004, Blanchflower and Oswald, 2008, Graham and Ruiz Pozuelo, 2017, Hayo and Seifert, 2003, Lang et al., 2011). Studies by Mroczek and Spiro (2005) and Easterlin (2006) report an inverted U-shape based on unique datasets such as the US Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Normative Aging Study (NAS) and the synthetic panel of the US General Social Survey (GSS).==== The studies by Frijters and Beatton (2012) and Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew (2012) show that the U-shaped effect is persistent in a cross-sectional framework, while it disappears when the empirical analysis includes panel fixed effects to control for unobserved individual-level heterogeneity. Meanwhile, Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew (2012) found that age has no effect on subjective well-being if the regression model accounts for the number of years the respondent has been part of the survey. Finally, in an empirical analysis of British and German representative household surveys, Wunder et al. (2013) report that SWB follows a wave-like pattern over the life course: Life satisfaction declines up to middle adulthood, then starts to increase, and eventually seems to decline again among the oldest old. The methodology used is quite different from previous approaches on the topic, as it implements a semi-parametric regression model with penalized splines (P-splines) to model the non-linear pattern of well-being across the life span. Overall, while theoretical explanations of the lifetime pattern of well-being vary widely across the scientific disciplines, the empirical evidence remains mixed even within the disciplines and especially in the literature on economics.====In our review of the relevant literature, we identified three key methodological issues that can be used to differentiate the empirical studies on lifetime patterns of well-being into groups. The first and most important methodological issue is the use of cross-sectional and/or longitudinal panel data. While in the first case, variation between survey respondents is used to identify the effect of age on well-being over the life span, in the second case, it is the time variation within survey respondents. In contrast to cross-sectional and/or repeated cross-sectional data, longitudinal panel data enable the inclusion of panel fixed effects in the regression model. The latter methodological approach provides coefficient estimates that are robust to individual-level heterogeneity due to the omission of key time-constant unobserved factors (for example, specific personality and/or genetic traits that might be correlated with both reported life satisfaction and longevity).====The second crucial difference between the empirical studies pertains to the specification of the age variable. Studies either employ indicator variables for each individual age category or pool individual observations into different age groups (defined for 10-, 5-, or 3-year intervals). Despite the functional flexibility of such an approach, it introduces the well-known identification problem regarding the simultaneous inclusion of birth cohort, time, and age effects in the regression model (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2008, Baetschmann, 2014). The majority of studies use higher-order polynomials of the age variable to examine the life-cycle pattern of well-being. For example, the U-shaped and/or inverted U-shaped relationship between well-being and age is typically tested using a quadratic specification of the age variable. Despite the functional simplicity of this approach, the use of higher-order polynomials predetermines the results to some extent. Specifically, the use of a quadratic function in age explicitly rules out more complicated relationships (e.g., a cubic association) between well-being and age.====The third important methodological difference between the studies is the selection of sociological, demographic, and economic individual-level controls that might confound the empirical relationship between well-being and age. There are a large number of control variables used in the literature. The most common are: household income, education, employment, health, marital status, gender, immigration status, number of children, birth cohort effects, panel attrition controls, survey-mode fixed effects, and individual fixed effects (depending on the type of data employed, i.e., cross-sectional and/or longitudinal panel data). Less often, empirical studies account for time effects, the respondent’s survey experience, and the possible confounding influence of the interviewer (e.g., interviewer gender and/or experience).====Overall, the plethora of associations between well-being and age (e.g., U-shape, flat, or wave-like pattern) is obviously caused by study-level methodological differences in the type of datasets used, the econometric methods applied, the functional forms tested, and the set of control variables included. Although some of these study-level methodological variations are based on different theoretical assumptions on the relationship between SWB and age, the impact of these differences on the econometric results must be identified to obtain a complete picture on the relationship between well-being and age.====In this paper, we propose a unified empirical framework to examine the impact of the aforementioned methodological issues on the relationship between well-being and age based on individual-level panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the period 1992 to 2016. To address the first methodological issue, we use a hybrid version of the correlated random effects (CRE) framework first proposed by Mundlak (1978) to examine the within and between effect of age on individual well-being simultaneously. This estimation framework has proven particularly useful to relax the zero correlation assumption between variables that vary across time and the individual-level unobserved heterogeneity in a standard random effects (RE) estimation approach. Extending the regression model through the inclusion of individual-level group means of the time-variant explanatory variables and estimating this augmented model under the RE assumption effectively controls for individual-level heterogeneity. In contrast to the standard fixed effects regression model, the CRE framework is capable of disentangling the within and between effects of time-variant controls. It is worth mentioning that this estimation framework even allows for the inclusion of individual-level controls that do not vary over time (e.g., gender) and that would otherwise be excluded when using the fixed effects estimator. We address the second methodological issue regarding the specification of the age variable by using higher-order polynomials for age. This allow us to test competing theoretical explanations of the life-cycle pattern of well-being (i.e., linear, flat, U-shaped, inverted U-shaped, or wave-like patterns). We examine the last methodological issue by including a large battery of individual-level controls that have been used in the literature to control for heterogeneity in individual life satisfaction both across time and across individuals. Beyond the aforementioned standard sociological, demographic, and economic factors, we also examine the robustness in the association between well-being and age to survey-specific conditions such as the respondent’s experience answering survey questions, the survey mode (e.g., telephone or face-to-face interview), whether the interview was conducted by a male, and whether the interviewer had extensive experience surveying respondents.====The results suggest that a cubic-type functional specification in the age variable leads to consistent within and between effects of age on SWB over the entire life span. This finding is consistent with a wave-like pattern in SWB over the life span. Furthermore, this specification is highly robust to the inclusion of a broad range of individual-level controls. This is in stark contrast to the regression results either using a linear and/or quadratic specification of the age variable, in which the corresponding within and between effects of age on well-being are contradictory and extremely sensitive to the inclusion of additional individual-level controls. It is worth mentioning that for the quadratic model specification, the U-shaped pattern in well-being is only present for the between-person dimension, whereas the within-person results would predict that the association is ==== U-shaped. Since this finding is based on the same number of observations and/or individuals observed at different points in time, we conclude that the U-shaped pattern is not empirically supported by our data over a longer age range, particularly for the German SOEP.====Even when using a sub-sample of those survey respondents aged 18–65 – a conventional model specification usually employed in the economics literature – we do not find support for a U-shape association between SWB and age for the within-person dimension. In contrast, our results show that the cubic polynomial specification of the age variable is statistically significant and highly robust in the 18–65 years old sub-sample, which would lead to a rejection of the U-shape association. We interpret this result as evidence that the age-well-being relationship is more complex than a U-shape relationship would predict even when we exclude a disproportional share of the human life cycle from the empirical analysis.====Regarding the estimated turning points of the wave-like pattern of SWB over the life cycle, the within- and between-person results reveal quite interesting and different findings. While the between-person results show consistent turning points at around mid-40s and 90s throughout the different model specifications, the within-person results indicate that SWB is stable between age 16 and 23 and then approaches a local maximum around age 75 if the same individual is followed over time. This finding indicates two distinct life cycle patterns for the between- and within person dimension regardless of whether we apply the cubic-type functional relationship to both dimensions.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the relevant literature on the empirical association between well-being and age, followed by a discussion of the key methodological differences across studies and their implications for the revealed association between well-being and age.

Data came from two years (2013 and 2015) of the Korea Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS) (N = 3615 households). Applying the ==== (PSM), ==== (DiD), and triple difference (DDD) approach, we used linear regression models with the fixed-effect model to estimate the effects of BPS. We found a significant increase in the expenditure ratio in absolute and relative ","The older population aged 60 and above has been rapidly increasing in Korea, reaching a super-aged society where the old age population will take up more than 20 % of the entire population in 2025. 38.2% of Korea’s population is projected to be aged 65 or older (Ministry of Health and Welfare [MOHW], 2012). As the population ages, poverty among older adults has urgent policy implications for older adults’ economic well-being, and also for promoting social cohesion in society. According to Statistics Korea (2020), the relative poverty rate (with median income of 50%) for disposable income among the old age population is 41.4 %, which is more than 3 times higher than that for the entire population (13.8%). Accordingly, consumption poverty is still much higher among the elderly (34.1%) than the entire population (10.0%). In fact, poverty rate among 66 year-olds or more in 2018 is the highest among the OECD countries, reaching 0.434. This is ten times higher than Norway, two times higher than Japan, and 0.15% higher than Mexico (OECD, 2021).====The slow expansion of contributory pension programs, combined with the rapid growth of aging populations, has led to a significant expansion of the role of social insurance or public transfers (i.e., non-contributory cash payments to older people) (Koh and Yang, 2019). Basic Pension, a non-contributory pension called social pension, was introduced in 2014 in Korea. In fact, this is an expansion of the benefit level in the previous program, Basic old age pension (BOAP). By substantially increasing the previous benefit level of the BOAP, the BPS has a dual policy goal of reducing the poverty rate among older adults and improving living standards of lower-income older adults, thereby enhancing their economic well-being.====We examined the BPS’ effect on consumption outcomes, specifically expenditures on essential items, health care, or consumption poverty. Using a quasi-experimental design and data from a nationally representative panel survey of South Korean adult households, we also examined the differential effects of BPS on consumption outcomes according to living arrangements and poverty status. We sought to understand the relative size of BPS effects by household size or composition and poverty level.====This study makes the following contributions. First, to date, investigations of social pensions in Korean and international settings have focused predominantly on income increase and poverty reduction (Amuedo-Dorantes and Juarez, 2015, Gasparini et al., 2010, Jensen, 2004, Kakwani and Subbarao, 2007, Lee et al., 2017). Few researchers have examined the effect of social pension programs on older households’ consumption. The outcomes of welfare policy programs can be evaluated with indirect indicators, such as income or resources, or direct measures, such as expenditure or quality-of-life indicators (Ringen, 1988). Consumption is a better measure of the resources available to a family than annual income, as income measures fail to capture differences in accumulating assets or access to credit between families and over time (Meyer and Sullivan, 2011).====Second, a detailed examination of policy effects on consumption reveals the degree to which the BPS benefit can meet the needs of economically disadvantaged old-age households (Kang and Kwon, 2006). Understanding the extent to which the BPS affects item-specific consumption reveals how older adults direct the BPS benefits. The BPS may help poor older households meet their basic needs and possibly pay for non-essential items like leisure activities or future investments. Furthermore, empirical evidence regarding the differential effect on more disadvantaged older adults is particularly important for noncontributory pension programs, considering the policy factors (budgetary constraints, public support, and un/intended dis/incentives) that determine whether and how to allocate resources to people with the greatest need (Barrientos, 2015).====Finally, this study contributes to the growing body of literature on social pensions for older adults in the context of an Asian country facing persistent old-age poverty and immature public pensions. As an industrialized nation, Korea is a member of the OECD; however, because of its concurrent phenomena of compressed economic growth, the lack of political and policy investment in social policy, and rapidly aging population aging, older adults have become Korea’s most vulnerable population subgroup (author citation).",The effect of social pension on consumption among older adults in Korea,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000578,10 January 2022,2022,Research Article,35.0

It is a secondary database analysis based on the Mexican Health and Ageing Study 2015 and the National Survey of Household Income and Expenditure 2016. The component costs included were: loss of labor income among unpaid caregivers, paid caregiver expenses, avoidable hospitalizations for primary care conditions, expenses on nursing homes, lost educational opportunities among underage caregivers and retired individuals providing care. Results indicate that the lack of a long-term care system for older adults in Mexico causes an annual cost of 2.430 billion dollars. This study aims to be an input to elaborate public policies by showing several major expenses that are mainly carried out by Mexican families.","Currently, both proportion and absolute number of older people in populations around the world are growing dramatically. This is mainly due to an increasing life expectancy and falling fertility rates (WHO, 2015). Since healthy life expectancy has not equally raised as life expectancy at birth, the number of years lived with functional dependence increased. Consequently, the number of dependent older adults increased (García-Peña et al., 2014). This process has developed faster in Mexico and the rest of Latin America than in developed countries (Castillo & Vela, 2005). For example, data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) indicate that people over 60 years old represented 6.2% of the total of Mexican population in 1990, while this number increased to 9.1% in 2010. According to projections from the National Population Council (CONAPO), 21.5% of total population will be older adults in 2050 (Agudelo & Medina, 2014).====Population aging added to other determinants results in increased disability and functional dependence. This is reflected in the inability of a person to perform regular and necessary day-to-day activities. Functional dependence has implications at the individual level and consequences that impact other areas, causing structural changes within the household and its members. It also has economic effects at the older adult, family and health system levels (Manrique-Espinoza et al., 2011, Salinas-Rodriguez et al., 2020).====Long-term care (LTC) has been defined by the World Health Organization as “the activities undertaken by others to ensure that people with, or at risk of, a significant ongoing loss of intrinsic capacity can maintain a level of functional ability consistent with their basic rights, fundamental freedoms and human dignity” (WHO, 2015). Although Mexico has one of the most accelerated population aging processes in the world, it currently has no public program to provide long-term care (LTC) for dependent older adults. By contrast, other countries such as United Kingdom, Canada, Spain and Sweden have systems explicitly aimed at dependent older populations. Although Mexico has programs designed to meet the economic and health needs of older adults, none of them involve long-term care. These programs fail to address financial needs resulting from a loss of autonomy nor provide suitable care in a permanent dependency situation. Furthermore, the government efforts to implement a long-term care system are still scarce and fragmented (CONEVAL, 2020). Approximately 21% of Mexican older adults have ADL limitations and 5% are considered dependent and require permanent care at home (Instituo Nacional de Salud Pública, 2012). In the absence of an established LTC system, the family is mainly responsible for this care. Hence, the family must provide, in addition to instrumental assistance, financial support that includes expenses related to health and care issues (García-Peña et al., 2014). This situation has direct impact on the well-being and quality of life of both older adults and their caregivers (Aguila et al., 2019, López and Jiménez, 2014).====Informal care is rarely taken into account for cost estimates, but the costs of unpaid work and the loss of opportunities are relevant to consider (ADI, 2015). For instance, several studies show that unpaid caregivers have to reduce hours from their formal paid working. In worst-case scenarios, they have to quit their jobs (Lilly et al., 2007). At the macro level, this translates into a significant economic impact on an aggregate basis. In such case, the consequence of neglecting this type of care will be the underinvestment in benefits for dependent people and their caregivers (Goodrich et al., 2012).====The proper quantification of expenses incurred by the public and private sectors (non-profit or profit) to provide long-term care is a very difficult task. It differs by the scheme of caring (home-based or institutions), by the severity of functional dependence, by the scheme for payments, co-payments, insurance, etc. In addition, there is no national data available to determine the amount of monetary cost and evaluate the figures (Joël et al., 2010).====We based our selection of component costs in the theoretical framework given by previous studies. First, we acknowledge that informal care has hidden costs that are not considered in the social and health policy agenda, which are relevant to estimate the real amount of caregiving expenses. As evaluated by Fast, Williamson, and Keating (Fast et al., 1999), the cost of informal care for older people include categories such as: out-of-pocket expenses, lost employment opportunities, unpaid work and emotional, physical, and social well-being costs. This approach was extended by Keating, Fast, Lero, Lucas, and Eales (Keating et al., 2014). They identified three broad fields of economic costs for informal caregiving: consequences on employment, out-of-pocket expenses and care work. Based on that, we simulated some of the main component costs assumed by society and the public sector, considering the Mexican specific context. The components of lost labor income, expense on paid caregivers and retired caregivers are based on the categories of lost employment opportunities, out-of-pocket expenses and unpaid work, respectively. Besides, the component of lost educational opportunities among underage caregivers contributes with different elements to be considered in the categories of lost employment opportunities, unpaid work and emotional, physical, and social well-being costs suggested by Fast, Williamson, and Keating (Fast et al., 1999). On the other hand, avoidable hospitalizations for primary care conditions and expenses on nursing homes were included as a result of the poor level of primary healthcare and the lack of a Mexican long-term care system. Both components were included as out-of- pocket expenses. The monetary figures presented in this study are expressed as constant 2019 dollars.====This study deepens the understanding on how monetary cost of caregiving for functionally dependent older adults in Mexico is a relevant topic for the implementation of a long-term care system. The foregoing is because monetary cost is one of the most relevant drivers for reform upon any sign of crisis in long-term-care systems (Bihan and Martin, 2013, Feder et al., 2000, Tsutsui and Muramatsu, 2007). Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate the main monetary costs due to caregiving for functionally dependent older adults, in the absence of a LTC system. To achieve this, the following was calculated: opportunity cost of loss of caregiver labor income, expense on paid caregivers, expense on avoidable hospitalizations due to primary care conditions, expense on nursing homes, opportunity cost of underage caregivers dropping out from school and cost of retired individuals providing care.",Monetary cost estimation of care for functionally dependent older adults in Mexico,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X2100058X,16 December 2021,2021,Research Article,36.0

We argue that the ineffectiveness of the German pension reform resulted from a change in employer behavior that was mainly induced by a recession during the implementation period of the pension reform. Employers seem to have nudged their employees to use a bridge option that was introduced with the pension reform (partial retirement) or a traditional bridge option (unemployment). These bridge options allowed an early retirement age (ERA) of 60 instead of the only alternative early retirement option with an ERA of 63. Bridge options therefore offered employers an opportunity to terminate employment considerably earlier and exert more influence over the employment exit age. We argue that without a change in employer behavior, neither using one of the bridge options nor the earlier employment exit would have been utility maximizing for the individuals affected by the reform.","In response to rising life expectancy, low fertility rates, and a shrinking labor force, most OECD countries have revised their retirement policies and introduced a series of pension reforms since the 1990s (OECD, 2007, OECD, 2015). For example, countries have increased the normal retirement age (NRA)==== and the early retirement age (ERA),==== tightened eligibility rules for early pension claims, or introduced actuarial deductions from pension entitlements for employees who retired before the NRA. The main goal of these reforms was to increase labor supply of older individuals and extend their working lives (see the overview presented by Börsch-Supan and Coile, 2018).==== All of these legislative efforts focused on labor supply, whereas the role of employers in the labor market of old employees was hardly addressed in these pension reforms.==== Accordingly, most papers evaluating the labor market consequences of pension reforms have focused exclusively on labor supply (Albanese and Cockx, 2019). Therefore, these papers explicitly or implicitly assume that employees can react autonomously to the labor supply incentives set by pension reforms and that labor demand is infinitely elastic (Dorn and Sousa-Poza, 2010, Peichl and Siegloch, 2012, Rabaté, 2019). In this paper, we show that the employment changes of older men after a pension reform in Germany cannot be explained by utility-maximizing employee reactions. We argue instead that a selected group of employers induced employees to leave employment earlier and thereby thwarted the success of the pension reform.====We focus on the earliest pension reform in Germany==== with the aim to increase old-age employment (Schmähl, 2003, Geyer and Steiner, 2014, Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund, 2015, Bönke et al., 2018). The pension reform increased the NRA to 65 years in monthly steps for almost all pension forms that granted access to early retirement. More precisely, for older male employees, the pension reform increased the NRA for early retirement options “pension for the long-term insured” from 63 to 65 years and “pension after unemployment” from 60 to 65 years. The ERA was unchanged and employees were still allowed to enter the pension after unemployment at age 60 and the pension for the long-term insured at age 63. The reform introduced actuarial deductions in pension entitlements for the difference between retirement age and the NRA instead. Finally, the reform introduced partial retirement with eligibility rules comparable to the pension after unemployment (Berg et al., 2020, Huber et al., 2016). Partial retirement and the pension after unemployment both can be characterized as bridge options that offered employees the option to exit employment already before exiting the labor market at the ERA (age 60) at the earliest.====We show that the goal of the reform to prolong old-age employment was not met for employees affected by the pension reform. Employment after the ERA actually decreased with increasing NRA and the associated pension deductions. We argue that the main reason for the ineffectiveness of the pension reform was a large shift of employees from the pension for the long-term insured to the bridge options partial retirement and pension after unemployment. The shift into the bridge options and the reductions in employment after the ERA are not consistent with the predictions of a standard option value model that assumes utility maximizing behavior of older employees and no change in employer behavior. The shift is also not consistent with the predictions of ex ante evaluations of the effects of the pension reform and international evidence on the employment effects of similar pension reforms. The labor market pattern however fits with the interpretation that both bridge options allowed employers to nudge their employees into an earlier exit from employment. Employers were interested in achieving a mutual agreement with their employees before dismissing them into unemployment or using partial retirement. Bridge options allowed them to determine an exit age from employment several years before the earliest alternative option (pension for the long-term insured). Employers were mainly interested in an earlier employment exit during the implementation phase of the pension reform because a depression decreased labor demand in general.====Older employees were strongly protected against dismissals based on social regulations in the dismissal protection law and they had a high chance to obtain compensation payments or win a lawsuit before a labor court when they contested a unilateral dismissal. Employers accordingly could avoid the reputation loss and financial uncertainties induced by unilateral dismissals of older employees by seeking a mutual agreement including compensation payments for the financial losses induced by earlier retirement via unemployment or partial retirement. Thus, most employers seemed to be willing to offer high transfer payments to compensate their employees for using one of the two bridge options. Consequently, we find that firms with high employment adaptation costs in particular were responsible for the large influx of older employees into the bridge options during the implementation phase of the pension reform.====We use representative administrative social security data from the Institute for Employment Research (Sample of Integrated Labor Market Biographies, SIAB7514) that cover labor market history since 1975. The data include selected employer information for more than 24,000 men eligible for early retirement. We calculate the reform effects by comparing the labor market outcomes of birth cohorts not affected (1935 and 1936) with the labor market outcomes of birth cohorts affected by the reform (1937–1941) for the entire implementation phase of the reform (1997–2006). To identify potential pension reform effects, our diff-in-diff approach exploits the cohort-specific variation of the actuarial deductions based on labor market exit. In addition to the cohort-specific labor market effect of financial incentives, we also calculate the full effects of the reform by comparing labor market outcomes between the last birth cohort not affected by the reform and the cohorts affected.====This paper contributes in several ways to the literature on labor market effects of pension reforms. It presents the first integral ==== analysis of the effects of the first German pension reform on employment, unemployment, and partial retirement for men. To the best of our knowledge, we in addition are the first to document a pension reform that provided financial incentives for employees to prolong employment but did not lead to a prolongation of employment in old age. An extensive literature consistently shows across countries and nature of pension reforms positive employment effects of retirement policies which restrict access to (early) retirement or reduce financial incentives for earlier retirement, Frimmel (2021). We argue that the failure of the reform mainly was a result of a change in employer behavior that was mainly induced by the business cycle and not a reaction to the reform. Models based on individual utility maximization theory therefore cannot fully capture the effects of pension reforms if they do not integrate employer behavior. We also show that in particular employees who work for employers with high employment adaptation costs may be nudged into earlier employment exit. Taking into account transfers such as compensation and severance payments offered by employers for accepting a bridge option extends the notion of “involuntary early retirement” used in the literature so far (Dorn and Sousa-Poza, 2010). Finally, we discuss the policy implications of the insight that employers may have the power to thwart the intended positive employment effects of a pension reform.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the institutional background of the pension system in Germany and the pension reform. We also derive theoretical predictions of the reform effect on the labor market based on arguments derived from the classic option value model and discuss the relevant empirical literature. In Section 3, we introduce our dataset and provide descriptive statistics of the labor market of older men. Section 4 explains our estimation approach and presents the estimation results.

A downwards time trend is evident with notable year-to-year variation. In contrast, the average age of initial receipt of Social Security retirement benefits has varied less over time, ranging from 63.5 in 1995 to 64.6 in 2017, masking the substantial variation in the percentage older adults claiming benefits when first eligible.====Understanding the factors associated with early claiming is important for public policy, as claiming early reduces an individual’s future monthly benefits. The reduction in benefits depends on the Social Security program’s full retirement age (FRA) and the age when benefits are claimed.==== The total reduction in monthly benefit if the claim is at age 62 rather than 67 (the FRA) is substantial, equaling 30%.==== Further, this reduction persists after the individual’s death if there is a survivor that claims the survivor benefit (Sass et al., 2007).====The literature on the timing of claiming has developed numerous hypotheses; however, previous empirical work has found few factors are statistically significant explanators of early claims. We offer a new test; specifically, that the likelihood of claiming Social Security early is associated with the level of financial stress reported by older adults, controlling for individuals’ economic and socio-demographic characteristics. Our focus is on the idiosyncratic component of financial stress that cannot be fully explained by financial variables typically included in estimates of early claiming.====The association of stress and early claiming could be in either direction. A negative association occurs when individuals who are financially stressed defer claiming Social Security. Financially stressed individuals may seek alternatives to an early claim of benefits such as drawing on their assets, increasing debt, or continuing full or part-time work. However, individuals with low earnings or who are unable to work may have less or no incentive to delay claiming than those with higher earnings as they may have fewer alternative resources. A positive association of financial stress and early claiming also is feasible. For example, consider an individual who has a health problem that is worsening and is concerned about the future cost. This health issue may lead to a positive association of early claiming and financial stress.====We recognize that the financial stress measures reflect many aspects of the economic situation of an individual (Keese, 2012). We do not claim to estimate the underlying causal mechanism of the stress-claiming relationship; rather, we describe the direction of relationship. Thereafter, we conduct a series of tests to determine possible mechanisms that are related to this relationship.====We use data from the biennial U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 2006 to 2014. The HRS reports whether the respondent received any income from the Social Security retirement program in the past month. This information is used to identify whether or not the respondent received Social Security retirement benefits in the year they were first eligible, when they turned age 62.==== Thus, our sample is a cross-section of individuals who turn age 62 in the sample period. Justifications for this focus on early claims include understanding the sizeable percentage of claims by newly eligible individuals despite the significant reduction in monthly benefit, and the sizeable intertemporal variation in this percentage. Another justification is that claiming Social Security benefits is essentially irreversible and thus the starting age is a key characteristic of this retirement benefit.====Our primary explanatory variables are two self-reported measures of an individual’s financial stress, lagged one survey wave (reported at age 60). The first measures the extent that a respondent has “difficulty paying their bills,” a common and widely used subjective measure in the material deprivation literature (Levy, 2015, Lusardi, 2010, Marshall et al., 2015). The other reports the extent of “ongoing financial strain” that lasted 12 months or longer, a subjective indicator of the emotional burden of prolonged financial stress (Smith et al., 2017).====An individual’s appraisal of their level of financial stress is influenced by the financial situation that they experience (Dunn and Mirzaie, 2016) and by their idiosyncratic response to this situation (Brown et al., 2020). A person’s genetics, coping strategies, psychosocial resources, and social resources may influence the idiosyncratic response. It has also been argued that older adults’ history of exposure to stressful experiences influences their appraisal of currently stressful circumstances (Thomas, 2016, Brown et al., 2020). Given that we control for the financial situation of the respondent and the household (assets, debts, income), our financial stress variables capture the association between the likelihood of an early Social Security benefits claim and this idiosyncratic stress response to their particular economic situation. Our use of lagged stress response variables breaks the obvious endogeneity that would occur if we used contemporaneous indictors of claim status and stress level.====We find that both measures of financial stress are negatively associated with early claims of Social Security retirement benefits. Those who report that it is difficult to pay bills at age 60 are about 5 percentage points less likely to claim Social Security benefits at age 62, as are those individuals who report a high level of financial strain. Thus, holding constant an individual’s financial and socio-demographic situation, those reporting greater financial stress are more likely to delay claiming Social Security retirement benefits. We also find that the relationship of the timing of claiming with financial stress is moderated by the level of an individual’s earnings.====The next section of the paper reviews the relevant literature on claiming Social Security retirement benefits. We then discuss our sample and the set of focal and control variables. Next, we present the results, followed by our conclusions.",The relationship of financial stress with the timing of the initial claim of U.S. Social Security retirement income,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000554,3 December 2021,2021,Research Article,38.0

Much of the literature on health and employment consists of studies using data on young or working-age adults for the United States and European countries. This study focuses on Korean middle-aged and older adults (ages 45 to 74 years) and uses ,"Health and labor income are central to economic security and social welfare (OECD, 2013a). The relationship between health and socioeconomic status, including labor income, has long been a topic of intense research. A positive relationship has been well documented in the literature using static models (e. g., Ettner, 1996, van Doorslaer et al., 1997; van Doorslaer & Koolman, 2004). However, static models have several limitations including autocorrelation and endogeneity problems. Health status in the past may determine current socioeconomic status. Similarly, previous socioeconomic status may influence current health status. Path dependency in and between health and socioeconomic status may cause serial correlation in residuals and endogeneity between past and current health and socioeconomic status, and make the static estimators inconsistent.====Dynamic panel data models with lagged predetermined variables (e.g., current socioeconomic status is affected only by lagged health, not contemporaneous health) can overcome some of the limitations of static models and address reverse causality while assessing underlying two-way causal links (Adams et al., 2003, Smith, 1999, Smith, 2004). With increasingly available longitudinal data, a growing number of studies have begun to use dynamic panel data models to investigate the dynamics of health (Contoyannis et al., 2004, Hauck and Rice, 2004, Jones et al., 2006, Ohrnberger et al., 2017) and the causal links between health and socioeconomic status including wealth, income, and educational attainment (Adams et al., 2003, Contoyannis et al., 2004, Hurd and Kapteyn, 2003, Smith, 1999, Smith, 2004). The existing literature suggests that the causal links may vary by the measures of health and socioeconomic status used in models and demographic characteristics. Results may also be context-specific given varying socioeconomic and health policies and environments. Yet, studies have so far been focused on young and prime-age populations (Halliday, 2017, Meraya et al., 2018) and confined to the U.S. and European contexts (Halliday, 2017, Economou and Theodossiou, 2011, Meraya et al., 2018, Michaud and van Soest, 2008).====This paper contributes to the literature by examining the two-way causal links between health and labor market outcomes among middle-aged and older adults in Korea, a context that has yet to be considered in this literature. We employ the system-Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), a well-established dynamic panel data model that addresses unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality. As a robustness check, we use the Maximum Likelihood Structural Equation Model (ML-SEM), a method that has been recently developed and relaxes some of the assumptions built in the Arellano-Bond model (Allison et al., 2017, Moral-Benito, 2013, Moral-Benito et al., 2019). We use labor income as our main economic outcome as a sizeable proportion of middle-aged and older Koreans are economically active. With 12 waves of the Korea Welfare Panel Study, we stratify the sample based on age, gender, region, income level, and marital status. It enables us to estimate the dynamic causal relationship that may run differently across demographic and socioeconomic groups.====Although international research on employment at older ages, retirement, and health is growing (Banks et al., 2020, Motegi et al., 2020), the case of Korea has rarely been studied. Korea is of particular interest to assess the bidirectional causal relationship between health and labor market outcomes of middle-aged and older people. First, Korea has been through an epidemiological transition in terms of declining mortality and increasing morbidity more recently than many other high-income countries (Jang & Kim, 2010). With a decrease in the old-age support ratio and an increase in the old-age dependency ratio, Korea has experienced rapid aging since 1975. Even faster growth in the aging population is expected in the next 35 years (OECD, 2013b, OECD, 2017). Chronic health conditions and prolonged working years with health problems become more prevalent with longer lives. Yet, the evidence on the economic consequences of health problems with causal interpretation remains limited in general and for Korea in particular. Second, more than a third of the people aged 65 and older remain in the workforce (Statistics Korea, 2018). The average retirement age from a primary occupation is 51.4 for men and 47.1 for women, but the mean exit age from the workforce is approximately 20 years higher: 72.9 for men and 70.6 for women (OECD, 2015). Although the mandatory retirement age was set to 60 in 2016, workers aged 45 to 54 are frequently recommended to retire earlier than 60 through the voluntary early retirement program. Third, in Korea, few individuals and households are fully insured against health shocks through existing social insurance programs. Although Korea has universal health coverage, many age-related diseases increase older people’s out-of-pocket expenditures (Kim, 2016). Lastly, despite the existence of several pension systems for older people, about half of older Koreans suffer from poverty (OECD, 2017). Various demographic, socioeconomic, and policy-related changes in Korea make it critical to examine the causal links between health and labor market outcomes of middle-aged and older people in the context of Korea.====We use a sample of Koreans aged 45 to 74 from the 2006–2017 Korea Welfare Panel Study. We find that both men and women are likely to earn higher income or do paid employment due to good health whereas only men may become healthier due to higher earned income or paid employment. The impact of labor income on health is larger than the impact of health on labor income for men.====Section 2 provides a brief overview of studies in which the relationship between health and socioeconomic status of older populations has been analyzed. Sections 3 and 4 present the data and the empirical strategy, respectively. Section 5 presents the results.

This study investigates the nature and extent of ,"West Africa sub-region is one of the very few sub-regions that has experienced increase in population growth up to around 1980, became cyclical till about 2015 when it started declining (ADB, 2018). Nonetheless, the projection indicates that the sub-region will account for a substantial proportion of the global increase of the youthful and working age population in the coming decades. Except this large proportion of the young population is harnessed, it will limit the potential opportunity provided by the African Agenda 2063 and the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These Agenda offer a unique opportunity for Africa to achieve inclusive, transformative and sustainable development, aspirations that are urgent in order to put the continent on a sustainable development path.====The existence of a heavy concentration of the population in the high-producing ages, who are also engaged in decent jobs implies more effective producers. While the effective producer is computed as the population that earn labour income at any age, effective consumer is calculated as the entire population (Mason et al., 2017). However, a large unemployed youthful population will be unable to generate adequate surplus because they earn little labour income. This results in reduction in the effective producers despite large effective consumers, thus leading to a low support ratio (ratio of the effective producers to the effective consumers), because dependency has increased. The support ratio, therefore, describes the relationship between people who are supporting the whole economy (through their involvement in productive activities) and the consumption needs of all the people in the economy (Olaniyan et al., 2018). It is computed as the inverse of the dependency ratio. In order to have a high support ratio, then few non-workers should be supported by workers. This increasing support ratio created overtime is what creates the first demographic dividend (Mason and Lee, 2015).====The demographic dividend is the economic growth potential that is created by favourable shifts in the age distribution of the population (Bloom et al, 2013). This dividend largely reflects the nature of demographic transition which influences the age structure as mortality and fertility rate adjusts. Creating and harnessing demographic dividend largely depends on the proportion of youth in a typical economy but the quality of this population plays a bigger role in the nature of the dividend as well as how long it can be enjoyed (Baerlocher et al., 2019, Bloom et al., 2017). Thus, the level of human capital development and access to decent employment may be critical in determining whether or not the dividend would remain a mirage and difficult to achieve. In West Africa, average growth rate of population stood at 2.7 percent between 2011 and 2016 with exponential growth being projected beyond this period, though disparities exist among the countries with Cape Verde having the lowest rate as low as 1.2 percent (ADB, 2018). According to UNFPA (2018), young people (10–24 years) constitute about 32 percent of the population of West in 2017, lying above the world average of 24 percent. However, educating these group of people still remained a serious challenge in the sub-region as only 38 percent male and 31 percent female enrolled in secondary school, while rural youth are presented with fewer opportunities than those in the urban areas (UNFPA, 2018). In the same vein, labour force participation rate for youth (15–24 years) stood at 43 percent while unemployment rate among the youth remains at 12 percent. These characteristics have serious implication on the nature of demographic dividend created and the number of years such dividend is expected to last.====The large proportion of the jobless youths can become an impediment to harnessing demographic dividend and sustainability of economic growth. In addition, it can weaken social cohesion, threaten peace and security, and create social and political instability in the coming decades. Sustainable development requires an optimal quantity and quality population to drive it. This is why it is imperative to understand the demographic dynamics in West Africa in order to assess the contribution of these demographic trends to how it will shape sustainable development as well as how it can assist the different countries to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030.====The study becomes pertinent given the need for West African countries to look inward for potential drivers of sustainable development, given the abundance of human resources and youth population with which the sub-region is endowed. Broadly, the sub-region has often been divided across its monetary zones into Francophone and Anglophone countries, thereby promoting wide disparity in the areas of policy, trade and human capital development. However, the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which is a key driver of the African Union Agenda 2063 is a right step on the path of integration in the region, necessitating the need for further regional integration especially in its demography. However, existing studies conducted for the region are country specific focusing on Senegal (Dramani and Ndiaye, 2012) and Nigeria (Bloom et al, 2013) and are limited in terms of policy implication for the region and ECOWAS.====This study therefore extends the literature by conducting regional study of West Africa as a whole, and further disaggregates the region across monetary zones into WAMZ and UEMOA. This is pertinent so as to align with the potential opportunity provided by the African Agenda 2063, there is need to align development plans, build strong institutions, harmonize policies options and ensure human capital development across the region. In addition, the application of the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) methodology for assessing demographic dividend for African countries is still limited to country specific analysis (Dramani and Ndiaye, 2012, Oosthuizen, 2015, Olaniyan et al., 2018). Consequently, this study focuses on West African sub-region using the NTA methodology in an attempt to fill the identified gaps. This regional analytical approach is particularly pertinent given the policy of free movement of people within the region. The resulting high level of migration requires strong policy coordination among the states as individual efforts to harness demographic dividend may be undermined. In fact, 84% of migration movements are directed towards another country in the region, which is seven times greater than migration flows from countries in West African to other parts of the world (ICMPD, 2015). Although these movements contribute to the regional integration process of the region, they create huge demographic concerns as population structure is altered with pressure on destination economies who are already struggling with socio-economic challenges relating to health, education and decent job opportunities. These issues therefore raise the following pertinent questions. (1) What is the nature of demographic dividend in West Africa? (2) How long does it take to enjoy this dividend? (3) How long does it take the dividend to reach the peak? This study, therefore, investigates the nature and extent of demographic dividend in the West African sub-region.====The sub-region is vital for the continental population dynamics. For the purpose of this study, the countries were aggregated based on the available monetary zones in the sub-region. These include West Africa Monetary Zone (WAMZ) comprising of Ghana, The Gambia, Liberia and Sierra Leone, as well as West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA including Cabo Verde and Guinea) comprising of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. For ease of analysis and relativity, Cabo Verde and Guinea are included among the latter.====The rest of the study is organized as follows: Following this introduction, section 2.0 presents the population dynamics of West Africa while section 3.0 reviews the relevant literature on demographic dividend. The methodology of the study is discussed in section 4.0, and section 5.0 contains the analysis and discussion of results.

We sought to measure and analyze the evolution of the concentration index (CI), horizontal index (HI) and decompositions of the CI. The evolution of the indices shows that there was a decrease in health care use inequities for doctor visits and mammography; in this first case the reduction was greater for rural areas, while for mammography the reduction was greater and significant for urban areas. However, despite increases in the prevalence of going to the dentist in different income strata, inequities have increased, showing that the benefits were greater for the wealthier individuals. Regarding the decomposition of factors associated with inequality, we can see that income and ==== appear as important variables in all cases. Thus, considering that older people increasingly demand health care, despite the advances made in this area, there are still important challenges. The inequities, mainly for mammography and dental visits, are still high and the differences between urban and rural areas are still significant, showing that public policies can be important in the search for greater equity.","The study of health inequalities and inequities is relevant especially in countries that are known to have serious problems of social inequality, such as Brazil. In this country, there is the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS)), which was created in the late 1980s, seeking to ensure a public, free and universal health system. However, despite its existence and the search for greater equity, there is evidence of inequity in access to health care services in a way that is favorable to the wealthier population.====The present study aims to analyze income-related health care inequalities and inequities for individuals aged 50 years or older in Brazil, in the period 1998–2019. Initially, it is important to make clear the distinction between the inequality and inequity, which, although they are often used interchangeably, present different definitions. First, both concepts are usually related to a distribution with respect to some socioeconomic status (in general, income, education, and asset index). The concept of inequality in health care refers to the situation in which individuals from different SES access different amounts of health care, that is, a SES-related health care inequality. However, when we analyze inequity (horizontal inequality), it becomes necessary to distinguish factors that should affect access (need variables) and those that should not (non-need variables). According to this view, there is inequity when the health care use is affected by non-need variables, in such a way that individuals with the same health care needs access different amounts of health care with an association related to their SES position (Morris et al., 2005). In this study, we will analyze both measures for the Brazilian population of older adults, but mainly focusing on inequities.====The study of this specific population is increasingly relevant given the economic, demographic, and epidemiological changes that the country has been going through. Despite the recognized advances since its conception, SUS still presents structural weaknesses that tend to make it even more vulnerable with the Brazilian scenario of economic and political instability. Crises in these spheres can negatively affect the health system through changes in the health needs of the population, and can lead to reductions in funds for the health system (Massuda et al., 2018). Additionally, we have a population aging scenario – it is estimated that in 2030 about 18.6% of the Brazilian population will consist of elderly people (60 years of age or older), reaching about one third of the population in 2060 (33.7%) (IBGE, 2015). This age group is particularly vulnerable for having a higher prevalence of chronic diseases and for requiring a greater variety of medical care (Brody, 1988, Channon et al., 2012). Although evidence indicates that the risk of death for most noncommunicable diseases has decreased in recent years, they are still responsible for the majority of deaths in the country and their costs represent a heavy burden on the health system (Borges and Borges, 2017, França et al., 2017). This scenario has the potential to further aggravate the problems of inequity as the pressure of demand increases in the health sector.====Although there are important contributions in the literature, little attention has been given to the measurement of inequalities and inequities in access to health care services for the older population. To the best of our best knowledge, there are only two evidences in the literature that sought to analyze this age group==== in Brazil (Channon et al., 2012, Mullachery and Macinko, 2020).====Thus, the present paper seeks to contribute to the literature in different ways: first, by analyzing the inequalities and inequities related to income regarding health care for individuals aged 50 years and older over time. The inequality and inequity measures are calculated using the Concentration Index (CI) and the Horizontal Index (HI), respectively, in five points of time (1998, 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2019), thus allowing to analyze possible trends. Second, different outcomes are considered. Considering older people (50 years or older), the evidence for Brazil analyzes only access to hospitalizations (for the specific year 2003) and mammography, not considering other types of access (Channon et al., 2012, Mullachery and Macinko, 2020). Seeking a more complete view of the difficulties of each health care sector, in this study we attempt to expand the analysis by investigating access in four outcomes – doctor visits, hospitalizations, dentists and mammography. In addition, unlike the two works previously mentioned, we seek to identify the factors that determine inequality through a decomposition analysis. This analysis has the potential to provide important information to support public policies that aim to reduce inequities. Finally, given the socioeconomic differences between urban and rural areas, the analyzes were carried out independently by areas to observe specific heterogeneities.====Through these analyzes, the article provides a better understanding of this subject that is increasingly gaining importance in the country. The article is divided into six sections, with this introduction. In the second section, we will present a brief overview of the health system in Brazil. In the third section, we will present the literature review. In the fourth, we will describe the methodology used.

Projections assume that the number of PwD will increase from 46.8 million in 2015 to 131.5 million in 2050 (Prince et al., 2015b). Furthermore, the prevalence of dementia increases exponentially with age. For example, the group of the oldest old, i.e. aged 85 and older, show the highest prevalence rates of dementia in Germany (Deutsche Alzheimer Gesellschaft e.V., 2020). Although a larger increase in the number of PwD is expected for lower middle-income countries (LMIC), most costs of dementia are incurred in high-income countries (HIC). The worldwide costs of dementia were US $ 818 billion in 2015; 86% of these costs occurred in HIC (Wimo et al., 2017). Of the total costs of dementia, 43% are caused by social care services (i.e. formal services provided outside the medical healthcare system, e.g. institutional care, professional home care, food supply, or transport), almost 38% by informal care and 19% by medical healthcare services (Wimo et al., 2017). Thus, dementia constitutes a substantial financial burden for societies and families of PwD.====Cost-of-illness (COI) studies measure all relevant costs of a disease and evaluate the socioeconomic impact of this disease in a specific period of time (Schöffski, 2012). According to a recent ====-analysis, the total costs per patient with Alzheimer's disease and per year amount to US $ 20,461 (€ 23,229) and significantly increase with the severity of the disease (Maresova et al., 2019). However, these costs vary considerably in the included studies from France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the USA. This is due to the fact that COI studies on dementia are heterogeneous in terms of methodological and analytical approaches, in particular how cost categories are classified and informal care -comprising the unpaid support and care provided by family members and friends- are monetarily valued (Costa et al., 2012, Maresova et al., 2018).====In order to assess the economic impact of a specific disease, it is reasonable to assess ====. Excess costs quantify the cost difference between a group of people affected by the disease in question and a comparison group that is not affected (Leicht & König, 2012). In regard to the excess costs of dementia in Germany, evidence is scarce. There are two studies that applied a payer perspective (i.e. German social security system) (Michalowsky et al., 2019, Schwarzkopf et al., 2012) and two studies that applied a societal perspective (Leicht et al., 2011, Michalowsky et al., 2019). In the study by (Schwarzkopf et al., 2012) annual excess costs per capita for healthcare services were significantly higher for PwD (€ 12,343 vs. 4,034 for PwoD). However, this study did not consider informal care costs. From a societal perspective, Michalowsky et al estimated € 33,188 total excess costs per patient and per year(Michalowsky et al., 2019). Mean age of participants in this study was 81 years. This study additionally showed that from a payer perspective living at home is less expensive than living in a nursing home. However, from a societal perspective it is more expensive due to informal care costs (Michalowsky et al., 2019). Finally, Leicht et al estimated annual excess costs of dementia by disease severity from the societal perspective of € 15,474 (mild), € 31,551 (moderate) and € 41,808 (severe). Participants in this sample had an average of 85 years (Leicht et al., 2011). The authors also concluded that most of total costs are caused by nursing care (institutional care, professional home care and informal care). Among these cost categories, informal care is the most expensive, which underlines the importance of considering informal care costs.====In the ==== of dementia, most studies applied a payer perspective (Deb et al., 2017, Geldmacher et al., 2013, Kuo et al., 2008, Morris et al., 2015). For example, total healthcare expenditures were higher for PwD than PwoD (US $ 14,508 vs. 10,096), mainly as a result of higher costs for health visits at home and prescriptions among PwD (Deb et al., 2017). Another study concluded that annual total excess costs are US $ 2,307 ($ 13,936 vs. 10,369 for PwoD) with outpatient prescriptions being the key driver (Kuo et al., 2008). None of these studies considered informal care. Paraponaris & Davin focused solely on informal care costs in PwD compared to PwoD living in France and concluded that the excess costs of informal care are € 1,400 per month (Paraponaris & Davin, 2015).====In summary, the current body of literature on excess costs of dementia shows that PwD cause higher costs compared to PwoD, and that informal care accounts for a considerable share of these costs.====This study aims at contributing to the existing evidence on excess costs of dementia in Germany from a societal perspective by focusing exclusively on the oldest-old, i.e. a population with a minimum age of 85 years. The rationale for this specific focus is based on three observations. First, in Germany the highest prevalence rates of dementia are found among individuals between the ages of 85 and 89 (Deutsche Alzheimer Gesellschaft e.V., 2020). Second, the prevalence of multimorbidity increases with age (Excoffier et al., 2018, Feely et al., 2017, Violan et al., 2014). Third, frailty is associated with multimorbidity (Hanlon et al., 2018). Hence, the general demand for health and nursing care services is high in our target group. Based on these observations it is even possible that the excess costs in this study are smaller than those in studies based on younger samples. As no previous study focused exclusively on this age group, the impact of dementia on health and nursing care costs is currently unknown. To comprehensively inform decision makers it is necessary to examine if dementia is associated with higher costs in certain service categories or if the general service demands in this age group monetarily offset the special service demands of PwD.",Excess costs of dementia in old age (85+) in Germany: Results from the AgeCoDe-AgeQualiDe study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000396,7 September 2021,2021,Research Article,46.0

We apply a novel ==== model, RIF regression methodology, to estimate the effect of marginal substitution between age groups, such as, for instance, a swap between the 35–44 age group (the reference group) and the 65 and older group. Our estimates indicate that the ==== increases by 0.010–0.022 when 10%p of the reference group is marginally substituted by the 65 and above group. It turns out that, when estimating the effects of population ageing on household income at different income quantiles, ageing decreases household income across the entire income distribution. On the other hand, when we control for individual characteristics, the overall impact of population ageing diminishes, and the household income of higher-income individuals actually increases.","Population ageing is generally known to aggravate income inequality (Lindert, 1978, Repetto, 1978). Recent studies have also confirmed a positive association between population ageing and income inequality (Kim et al., 2014). Older workers are more likely to retire from the labor market, which implies that a higher proportion of the retired results in a reduction in average household income, which accordingly intensifies income inequality.====Recent studies of the association between income inequality and population ageing tend to exploit either variation across countries or regional variations within a specific country (Zhong, 2011, Lee et al., 2013, Van Vlief and Wang, 2015). A few studies have found a positive relationship between population ageing and income inequality (Kim et al., 2014), while others report only limited effects. Gustafsson and Johansson (1999) used data from OECD member countries to show that the effects of population ageing on income inequality are not statistically significant. Biewen and Juhasz (2012) found that the impact of population ageing on inequality is minimal, but they consider only a relatively short observational period. Similar findings have also been reported in developing countries (Qu and Zhao, 2008, Liu, 2014). On the other hand, another strand of research shows the opposite result, namely that population ageing alleviates income inequality. Among others, Chu and Jiang (1997) found a negative association between population ageing and income inequality in their study of demographic change in Taiwan and China. However, it appears that the study does not account for the important explanatory variables of educational attainment, level of industrialization, and social security systems (Zhong, 2011).====Income inequality in South Korea began to intensify with the polarization of wage income in the mid-1990s, and this accelerated during the Asian economic crisis of 1997. After this crisis, the income gap widened further under the situation of the high unemployment rate provoked by skill-biased technological progress that sought to increase demand for skilled workers (Park, 2000, Yoo, 2004). In addition, income inequality will be further exacerbated as Korean society ages.==== This is because the pensions for the elderly are extremely low compared to those allotted in other advanced countries. This is due to the immature pension system, which was universally introduced only in 2003 even though the proportion of the population aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly in South Korea since well before the 1980s.====In this study, we quantitatively examined the effects of population ageing on income inequality in a single country using a recentered influence function (RIF) approach, a recently developed econometric model. RIF regression can be used to analyze the effects of population ageing on the Gini coefficient and on the average household income across the entire income distribution. Given that South Korea is one of the most rapidly ageing countries in the world, this quantitative study can provide insightful policy implications by identifying the impact of population ageing on income inequality, which is likely to occur in other countries in the future.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section “Empirical framework” introduces the RIF regression methodology used in this paper. Section “Data and results” presents the data and discusses the results of the empirical analysis.

What are the differences and similarities between NDC pensions and PAYG pensions? How is the return rate of NDC account determined? Do pensions affect the labor market equilibrium and work engagement behavior? This study answers such questions and elucidates the relationship between NDC pension scheme and fertility by considering endogenous labor supply in an imperfect labor market with ==== in a two-period overlapping generations (OLG) model. The analysis reveals that fertility and NDC pension account return rate are positively correlated; hence, increasing the return rate of the NDC account may improve people’s fertility incentives. Second, NDC pension system and PAYG pension is different in children’s externality on the society. Third, the account return rate depends on the wage growth rate, the fertility level and the employment status. Fourth, higher pension benefits could lower the unemployment rate and disincentivize shirking behaviors.","Population aging, caused by the decrease in fertility and increase in longevity, has become an increasingly serious demographic problem for many countries. This problem has been exacerbated by the retirement of baby boomers born during the 1950s and early 1960s and the reduction in their retirement age. Now, a decreasing workforce has to bear an increasingly heavier social security tax burden for the rapidly growing elderly population, causing widespread concern for researchers and policymakers on the sustainability and viability of the current social security system. Financial pressures on the pension system could attract unpopular cuts in retirement benefits and increases in retirement age, as well as increasing pension contributions of young workers.====To address this fiscal crisis due to population aging, several countries are in the process of reforming their social security system, especially their pension system. Sweden is among the pioneers in pension reform and implemented a partially funded notional defined contribution (NDC) plan in 1994, an important innovation in pension reform.==== The NDC plan indicates characteristics of funded defined contribution plans, but retains the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension financing method.==== Specifically, this plan promises that the workers’ contributions will be credited into an account, and that these contributions and the accrued returns will be returned to them during retirement. In reality, however, this account is “notional”, because no contributions are actually credited to the account. The retirement benefits are in effect financed by the pension contributions of the young workers of the same period according to the account records, just as in the PAYG pension system. Sweden balances their pension liability and assets by adjusting the account return rate. In this sense, the authority has greater control over the stability of this pension system compared to the existent PAYG pension system, thus increasing the credibility of the pension system among the public.====Therefore, how to determine the return rate of the individual accounts is a sticky point in the reform discussion on maintaining the financial balance of the NDC system, as numerous studies suggested.==== Generally, the government manipulates and adjusts the return rate according to the economic growth. The methodology of this pension plan leads to intriguing discussions and implications on the relationship between demographics and pension parameters. However, while numerous studies have recorded the characteristics, the history, and how the annual retirement benefits are determined under the NDC pension reform, few studies have explored how demographic changes affect the NDC pension system and how exactly the account return rate is determined. On the other hand, a large literature has discussed the relationship between PAYG pensions and fertility. As NDC pensions retain the characteristics of PAYG pensions, it is natural to examine NDC pensions’ relationship with fertility as well as the similarities and differences between the two kinds of pensions. This study explores the relationship between the NDC pension schemes and demographics by analyzing the pension parameter effects on fertility and the feedback effects of fertility on the pension schemes, in the course of which it compares the NDC pensions with the traditional PAYG pensions in the externality of children. This study also demonstrates the steady-state account return rates and fertility rates taking into account the labor supply status, demographics, and economic growth.====To understand the impact of pension on labor market equilibrium and work engagement behavior, a bridge to connect pension and labor market needs to be introduced. The efficiency wage of the shirking model (Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984), which is set higher by the firms than the market clearing wage to prevent shirking behavior, is considered in this study. The first conundrum to break through is whether or not pension can substitute wage, that is, whether or not a higher pension could work as a compensating wage premium when they accept jobs with undesirable wage characteristics, just as proposed by the equalizing differences hypothesis.==== The second problem is whether or not and how much pensions affect the labor market equilibrium and behavior. Namely, when pensions change, whether or not equilibrium of labor market changes, and how much the employment status will be affected.==== On the other hand, the relationship between pension and fertility is related to the wage level since the employment performances will affect the fertility incentive under the assumption that children are consumption goods in this study.====This study contributes to the literature in several dimensions: it provides a simple but comprehensive model incorporating the features of the NDC pension system of Sweden, and offers a new perspective in revisiting the correlations between pension systems and fertility as well as exploring how the notional account return rate is determined in the presence of financial stresses due to population aging. This study also confirms the validity of the “equalizing differences” hypothesis and demonstrates that higher pension benefits will help lower the wage threshold that ensures no shirking behavior and consequently decrease unemployment rate.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the related literature. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4 demonstrates the labor market equilibrium and the dynamics of endogenous unemployment. Section 5 gives calibration. Section 6 shows the pension effect on unemployment, fertility, and welfare. Section 7 displays the fertility feedback effect on pension systems and welfare analysis.

By using OLS and Tobit estimators, we test whether contribution evasion is part of an intertemporal portfolio allocation and competes with other forms of wealth-accumulating assets. Empirical results on repeated cross-sectional Italian microdata confirm that contribution evasion decreases as life expectancy increases, and increases when the return on other long-term wealth-accumulating assets increases.","Common wisdom often suggests that tax evasion has a simple motivation: the attempt to escape due payment. The literature has proved that this is only partially true, and that the choice of evading responds to a complex combination of causal factors that jointly push people beyond legality (Hashimzade, 2012). This is particularly true when a specific type of tax evasion is examined, namely social contribution evasion (SCE). Indeed, paying towards one’s pension grants benefits which are not as evident as when one pays taxes. When an agent pays social security contributions, she or he expects to receive as a benefit a higher pension payment in the future. This makes SCE, even in a mandatory contribution system, conceptually a very different phenomenon from tax evasion. Typically, in the presence of the latter, the benefit of not paying is less tangible and harder for the taxpayer to perceive immediately, whereas, as argued above, in the former this should not be the case. This suggests that SCE has very specific features, and its motivations may greatly differ from those that lie behind tax evasion. Surprisingly, however, despite these distinctive features which make SCE differ from tax evasion and elusion, and despite its pervasiveness in many economies– for which many governments in different countries push towards pension reforms in search of a sustainable system –, this phenomenon has received very little scholarly attention.====Bailey and Turner, 2001, Mcgillivray, 2001 are among the few to discuss the rationale of contribution evasion. Their presumption is that individuals evade mainly because they trade an increase in the benefits associated with higher consumption against the cost of being fined. They also introduce the idea of myopic behaviour of agents who do not fully internalize future forgone income. More recently, Perotti (2012) stressed that contribution evasion also depends on the future expected income from pensions and from the expected probability of surviving at an older age. She focuses on the Bulgarian case and exploits an interesting natural experiment following a pension reform to measure SCE, albeit with a small sample.====Following a different research route, Finkelstein and Poterba (2004) found for both the mandatory and voluntary annuity markets that individuals with a higher life expectancy buy insurance contracts that make higher payouts later in life (and vice versa). This suggests that it is possible to frame contribution evasion in an allocation perspective, as part of an intertemporal portfolio optimization problem. Indeed, individuals may look at SCE simply as one of the variables to choose from in solving a problem of optimizing consumption through their lifetime.====By following such cues from the literature, we empirically analyse SCE in a context of intertemporal resource allocation in which agents choose optimally how much to pay towards their pension in terms of contributions. Filling a gap in the literature, this approach provides an initial attempt to analyse the issue under a quite different angle and allows investigation of the role which factors such as life expectancy play in determining social security contribution behaviour, and especially SCE. Specifically, to model agents’ behaviour, we assume that contribution evasion enters the agent’s intertemporal portfolio allocation, and competes with other forms of wealth-accumulating assets. The individual who evades social security contributions is partly substituting future for present consumption, and is partly allocating savings in alternative investment assets. Expectations on future income, the intertemporal preference rate, and alternative long-term investment opportunities will all play a role in determining this type of evasion. Resources subtracted from pension contributions, as well as being immediately consumed, may be allocated to long-term financial assets. If this is the case, factors influencing future pension returns and alternative long-term investment opportunities will influence the degree of contribution evasion. As a corollary, it may also be argued that an increase in the level of life expectancy, by increasing expected pension payments, will negatively affect the level of SCE. In this sense, contribution evasion can be seen as a bet on the chance of surviving beyond retirement age, and hence a kind of dead pool in which the insurance company, or the state in the case of public pensions, bets on the agent’s death. The premium of this insurance buys the future stream of consumption after working age. From this perspective, our theoretical insight is also grounded in what Finkelstein and Poterba (2004) found in mandatory and voluntary annuity markets.====In this paper we focus on Italy, a country with mandatory social contributions towards pensions, and employ Bank of Italy cross-sectional data from the Survey on Household Income and Wealth to build a proxy of contribution evasion and test empirically the idea that life expectancy affects contribution evasion. The empirical result confirms our intuition: SCE decreases as the return on other financial assets decreases and life expectancy increases. Also of interest is the role of children and of other household members. While the number of the former has a positive impact on SCE, and thus suggests that children are seen as a substitute good in terms of pensions, an increase in the number of other household members increases contributions towards pension, possibly because it takes the form of pension transferability to the surviving family.====The rest of the work is organised as follows. The next section discusses the literature, while section three describes the data.

Utilizing recent population projections and South Korea’s National Transfer Accounts, the paper applies a simple decomposition model measuring the respective effects of fertility and mortality on separate aspects of the economy: labor income, private and public consumption, and public and private transfers. The results show that the effects of low fertility and low mortality on the economy are very different in direction, magnitude, timing, and impact by age group. The only effect of an aging population that is the same in all circumstances is the effect on the public pension system: low fertility and mortality will increase pressure on the public pension system of South Korea.","The debate over the source of population aging is motivated by a similar question: does fertility or mortality drive population aging? The conclusion that a decline in fertility is the largest factor in population aging in high-income countries has been widely accepted since Coale, 1957, Keyfitz, 1975. On the other hand, some studies have concluded that population aging in some advanced economies is mainly due to a decline in mortality (Horiuchi and Preston, 1988, Preston et al., 1989, Preston and Stokes, 2012). Lee and Zhou (2017), however, argue that this conclusion misrepresents the analysis, and that fertility decline is still largely responsible for past and current population aging, regardless of mortality trends.====Although the debate over the relative importance of changes in fertility and mortality in population aging is an interesting research question, the economic impact and policy implications are far from clear. For example, pension expenditures in a nation with a pay-as-you-go pension system are closely linked to the longevity of older people, while total contributions to the pension system are more likely to be related to past fertility trends, which affect the size of the workforce. Likewise, education expenditures are more likely to be affected by fertility trends of the previous two decades, but not by mortality trends.====This research examines how these two factors of population aging, fertility and mortality, will affect South Korea’s (hereafter Korea) economic future. In this study, the economic effects of falling fertility and mortality are examined by considering the changes in population age structure under alternative demographic scenarios. We apply a simple decomposition model measuring the respective effect of fertility and mortality on separate aspects of the economy: labor income, private and public consumption, lifecycle deficit, and public and private transfers. We calculate the changes in aggregate economic variables given the base year per capita age profiles and the projected population age structure under various fertility-mortality scenarios.====Korea is an interesting case study in large part owing to its exceptional speed of population aging. While the basic picture is the same worldwide, Korea is aging much more rapidly than other countries primarily because its fertility rates have declined more rapidly. The total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 4.53 children per woman in 1970 to 2.06 in 1983, below the population replacement level. It remained at around 1.6 from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s and fluctuated between 1.05 and 1.47 with a downward trend from 2000 to 2017. The TFR fell below 1 (0.98) in 2018, and it further decreased to 0.92 in 2019 and to 0.84 in 2020, the lowest level in the world. At the same time, life expectancy in Korea rapidly increased, from 62.16 (men 58.70, women 65.80) in 1970 to 67.55 (men 63.40, women 71.90) in 1983. Life expectancy continued to rise over the next three decades, reaching 83.3 (men 80.3, women 86.3) in 2019, the second-highest among OECD countries. As a result, the share of the population ages 65 and older increased from 3.1 percent in 1970 to 14.9 percent in 2019. The old-age dependency ratio also exceeded the youth dependency ratio in Korea in 2017.====The unprecedented rapid population aging is one of the most important economic and social risks in Korea, which hinders sustainable growth and social cohesion. Given the tight labor market, the elderly is also driven into bridge jobs, which is characterized by temporary and low income. The population aging in Korea will also undoubtedly negatively affect the country’s fiscal sustainability even in the near future. However, little is known about how various economic outcome variables (labor income, consumption, transfers) will be affected based on different fertility and mortality scenarios. That is the motivation for this study.====The results show that the consequences of the two sources of population aging, falling fertility and mortality, are not the same. Although both factors contribute to population aging, their effects on the economy are very different in direction, magnitude, and timing. In addition, the effects depend significantly on economic variables themselves: labor income, consumption, and public and private transfers. Only the pension system is affected in the same way by both low fertility and low mortality: both of them will increase the pressure on the public pension system of Korea.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the methodology and data. It is followed by a description of Korea’s generational economy and the implications of population aging.

This paper analyses the relevance of using socioeconomic characteristics to differentiate the retirement age. Using US mortality rates assembled by Chetty et al. (2016), we simulate the lifespan distribution both across and within socioeconomic categories. Then, we analyze these categories’ ability to predict the lifespan of individuals. Results suggest that socioeconomic status has a relatively limited predictive power, due to the huge lifespan heterogeneity “within” each of them.","Extensive research by demographers and economists has shown that life expectancy differs across socioeconomic status, with low-educated or low-income people living, on average, shorter lives than their better-endowed and wealthier peers (see e.g. Chetty et al., 2016, Olshansky et al., 2012). This issue has recently received critical attention for its impact on the pension system (OECD, 2018). Bommier et al. (2011) have shown that the progressivity of the French pension system is reduced by one quarter to one half when differences of life expectancy are taken into account and Haan et al. (2019) suggested that the German pension becomes regressive. In order to overcome this problem, the (usual) policy recommendation from the empirical literature has been to differentiate retirement age by socioeconomic status (see e.g. Ayuso et al., 2017). The theoretical literature has reached similar conclusions (see e.g., Leroux et al., 2015, for a survey). However, those policies do not take into account the heterogeneity of lifespans within socioeconomic status. To the best of our knowledge, existing empirical works by economists on retirement age differentiation only focus on the problem of compensating individuals for life expectancy differences. This paper stresses the importance of also considering lifespan differences.====The difference between life expectancy and lifespan is a key point of this paper. Whereas life expectancy is the number of years someone can (at a given age) ==== to live, her lifespan is the number of years she ==== lives. Life expectancy is an indicator that “hides” the (potentially important) distribution of a lifespan inside each socioeconomic status. If policies are based on life expectancy differences, individuals living less/more than their life expectancy will end up being treated with the wrong policy. Although the importance of this problem has been addressed theoretically; it has not received much attention in the empirical literature. Pestieau and Racionero (2016) build a model with short-lived and long-lived individuals working either in a harsh or a safe occupation. Realistically, they assume that short-lived workers are over-represented in harsh occupations. Lifespan (i.e. being short- or long-lived) is private information, but occupation is observable and can be used as a “tag” for lifespan by policymakers. They showed that the social planner established a common lower retirement age for short-lived individuals (whatever their occupations) in the first best solution.==== Then, they discussed the optimal second-best and compared two options: a common social security policy across occupations and tagging (i.e. differentiated retirement age by occupation). They concluded that there is a case for differentiating the retirement age by occupation. However, such a result is not as straightforward as one would assume. Notably, because “the short-lived workers in safe occupations are harmed from being mixed up with a large proportion of long-lived workers, (…) and the long-lived workers in harsh occupations [undeservedly] gain from being pooled with a large number of short-lived workers” (Pestieau and Racionero, 2016, p. 200). There is an immediate parallel with individuals divided by socioeconomic status, characterized by a significant lifespan heterogeneity within socioeconomic status. In both cases, information is not known (or used) by the policymakers. Although, it is not clearly mentioned in the literature, differentiating the retirement age according to the socioeconomic gradient in life expectancy follows the “tagging” principle introduced by Akerlof (1978). According to him, social policy should be based on “tags” to reach the needy. However, tagging is imperfect and individuals can end up missclassified. Short-lived individuals could be tagged as long-lived, because they are mixed in a group with long-lived individuals. This missclassification arises because the decision maker uses observable characteristics (e.g. job) to infer unobservable ones (e.g. lifespan). Using terms introduced by Phelps (1972), the decision maker discriminates “statistically” against short-lived people working in soft occupations.====Drawing from this literature, this paper investigates empirically the importance for pension policy of lifespans heterogeneity within socioeconomic status. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been done before. We proceed in four steps.====Tagging is currently not widely used in pension policy. This is also the case for many other social policies or for taxation; a situation which, to some extent, contrasts with what economic theory recommends (Weinzierl, 2012). However, the current pension crisis==== could make tagging a more common policy tool. Governments struggle to make their pension reforms (often, a higher retirement age) socially acceptable. One common criticism is that the raise of the retirement age should be more “tailored” to each individual’s profile and circumstances. For example, Vermeer et al. (2016) showed that the population wants the retirement age to be lower for those who have done hazardous jobs. It is therefore important to better assess the pros and cons of tagging in retirement policy.====This paper considers three possible tags: gender, income and state of residence. That choice is partially driven by data availability. The use of any particular tag raises many ==== questions. A traditional one is the risk of moral hazard. Ideally, the social planner should be able to use a tag that the individual could not change. Such, that an individual cannot try to modify her category to switch from one to another in order to benefit from another policy. For example, if a subset ==== has a lower retirement age, it should not be possible for an individual of subset ==== to modify her tag to be identify as a member of subset ====. Gender is naturally not prone to moral hazard. However, tagging by income percentile or state of residence could be more problematic. Our answer to this problem is the following. Tagging by income is less prone to moral hazard if the policy uses a relative indicator (e.g. percentiles). It is easier to place oneself below/above a particular income threshold than in a particular place in the income distribution (e.g. at the 80th percentile). Moreover, it would make more sense to tag by lifetime income percentile, which makes the issue even less problematic. We come back to this point in Section “Increasing the number of ages of retirement”. The state of residence is also naturally prone to moral hazard. However, in the particular context of the US and of the Chetty et al. (2016) data we use here, it does not appear to be a powerful tag. Therefore, we presented it more as an example in a first best framework. Another important feasibility aspect is the legality of tagging. Retirement ages were differentiated by sex, which was then made illegal.==== From a purely economic point of view, it is not clear why governments are allowed to differentiate the retirement age based on occupation,==== but not based on gender. In this paper, we leave aside those discussions and concentrate on the intrinsic ==== of tagging.====A final remark is that our paper only deals with retirement age differentiation. Other parameters of retirement policy could be used by an egalitarian social planner. One could imagine a pension policy where the retirement age is uniform and the replacement rate is reduced when lifespan rises.==== The respective merits of these two policies could be compared and form a fully-fledged research agenda. The point is that both approaches fundamentally depend on the planner knowing the distribution of lifespan. If, as seems inevitable, the social planner can only use proxies (i.e. categories correlated to lifespan), then both policies will be less effective at achieving his objective. At the end, this is fundamentally due to the lack of predictive power of the tags. The magnitude of this problem could be studied by simulating different policy scenarios (e.g. retirement age differentiation, replacement rate differentiation). However, the results would converge. We have chosen to base our paper on the retirement age because the numeric examination of the retirement age differentiation is more tractable and palatable. A “retirement age gap index” is easier to apprehend (and manipulate) than the corresponding “replacement rate gap index”.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section “Gap index” constructs and presents our “gap index” aimed at measuring the relevance of the socioeconomic tag(s) that could be used by a social planer. Section “Gap index and traditional pension policy” discusses how the equalisation of the share of life spent in retirement relates to the more traditional objective functions of pension decision makers. We explained our simulations in Section “Data construction”. Section “Results” details our results. In Section “Discussion”, we discuss more in-depth some normative principles underpinning the paper (ex ante vs ex post approach to lifespan and individual vs. group differentiation) and then, we conclude.",The limited power of socioeconomic status to predict lifespan: Implications for pension policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000323,24 June 2021,2021,Research Article,52.0

To investigate this, we employ the Korean ==== of Aging and a research design that relies on plausibly exogenous variation in the sex composition of the sibship. We provide evidence that it costs more to raise sons than daughters in South Korea, particularly for older cohorts. Thus, in the absence of sufficient transfers from adult sons to parents, parents will fund their earlier investments in their sons by increasing their labor supply. Consistent with this, we show that parents with more adult sons are more likely to delay their retirement. In particular, a father with all sons has a probability of being retired that is 5.5–6.0 percentage points lower than a comparable father with all daughters. Fathers also work 16.8 percent more hours per week when their sibship consists of all sons. These effects are the most pronounced for poorer households and for older cohorts.","Households transfer a vast amount of resources across generations. When children are young, parents typically invest in their education and other forms of human capital. As a result, net transfers to the very young tend to be positive in most societies. However, as children grow older, transfers to them usually decline and, by the time they are adults, they can turn negative if adult children care for their elderly parents.====Transfers from grown children to their parents in old age are often viewed as a form of repayment called for by an implicit contract (Lillard and Willis 1997). Despite the prevalence of public and private pensions, as well as more advanced financial products, many elderly parents in certain parts of the world still rely on familial transfers from their grown children for consumption. This is particularly true in Asia, where familial transfers from grown children to their parents are much more prevalent than in other economies (Lee et al., 2011).====The evidence on children providing care (either financial resources or time) for elderly parents as repayment for the parents’ earlier investment in their upbringing is somewhat mixed and very much depends on context.==== The practice is probably strongest in Asian countries, where there is evidence that adult sons tend to transfer more resources to their elderly parents than adult daughters (Yang, 1996, Sun, 2002, Lin et al., 2003, Kim, 2010). In the United States, however, studies of the role of a child’s sex on transfers to their parents show the opposite—namely, that American daughters are more likely than sons to provide assistance to aging parents (Coward and Dwyer, 1990, Dwyer and Coward, 1991, Stoller, 1990, Shuey and Hardy, 2003). Similarly, Xie and Zhu (2009) show that in urban China married daughters provide more financial support to their elderly parents than married sons do.==== What these findings suggest is that, over the life course, net transfers from parent to child can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the prevailing social mores of a given society.====In the case of positive net transfers from parents to their children, parents will require additional income to fund them. Probably the most obvious source of increased income available to parents is at the extensive margin via delayed retirement or at the intensive margin via longer work hours. However, little is understood about the extent to which parents actually adjust their labor supply in response to changes in net transfers within the household.====One area that can shed light on this question is the gender disparity in parental investments in children, which often stems from long-standing social norms. When parents do not or cannot manipulate the sex composition of their sibships, the relative number of boys and girls within a household can provide researchers with plausible exogenous variation in intra-familial transfers.==== Specifically, in societies with a strong bias toward males, households with relatively more boys will tend to have more transfers from parents to young children. Depending on the extent to which grown children take care of their elderly parents, this can result in more net transfers from parent to child over the life course of the parents.====In this study, we estimate the effects of the sex composition of the sibship on the labor supply of elderly Koreans. We employ the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) from the period 2006–2016 and find strong evidence that having more boys increases the labor supply of elderly fathers in South Korea (henceforth Korea) at both the intensive and extensive margins. We show that, conditional on the total number of children, fathers with all sons have a probability of being retired that is 5.5–6.0 percentage points lower than fathers with all daughters. These effects are the most pronounced for poorer fathers and for older cohorts.====Our empirical results provide evidence of a link between the sex composition of the sibship and the labor supply of elderly fathers. We show that differences in intra-familial transfers across genders are a mechanism linking the two. We provide evidence from the KLoSA that parental transfers to children are higher when households have more boys, particularly, for older cohorts. Consequently, our results suggest that parents with more boys than girls need to work longer hours and later in life to fund the investments that they made in their children earlier in the life course.====Importantly, however, these effects are most pronounced for older cohorts for whom net transfers to children were most biased towards sons. These effects are much more muted for younger cohorts. This suggests that changing social norms may also be impacting household behavior.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide some institutional details on gender preference and intra-household transfers in Korea. After that we discuss the data and the methods that we employ. Next, we describe how intra-familial transfers affect labor supply in a stylized model. We then present the results.

The virus then rapidly spread to almost all countries in the world. Millions of people have been infected since then, many of them were hospitalized, and more than 2.7 million people worldwide were confirmed dead with or from COVID-19 as of March 22, 2021. About 20 percent of those deaths occurred in the United States (====). To fight the spread of the disease, most countries enacted unprecedented lockdown measures, such as closing schools, restaurants, and shops; restricting national and international travel; and implementing social distancing measures or preventing gatherings altogether (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Besides the large health and social burden, the economic burden of COVID-19 and of the policy measures against its spread are also huge. Several studies show that this holds for various policy and behavioral scenarios (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====).====, ====, ====, ====Our contribution aims to complement the results of SIR-amended macroeconomic models by establishing the economic burden of COVID-19 absent behavioral and policy responses, accounting for the age- and human capital-specific effects of COVID-19 on the workforce and the effects of treatment costs on capital accumulation. In doing so, we apply the health-augmented macroeconomic model (HMM), which is based on a human-capital augmented production function that we have co-developed and applied previously to estimate the economic burden of noncommunicable diseases, of diseases due to smoking or air pollution, and of road accidents (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====We are considering a counterfactual scenario in which behavioral reactions of individuals and policy responses are absent.

Our scenario may also be considered conservative as it does not factor in behavioral responses, i.e., changes in consumption and work patterns for fear of infection even absent any policy.

The article investigates the impact of objective and subjective memory on the financial decisions of older adults, such as asset holdings, allocation, and financial health. In general, older adults with higher objective memory have better financial outcomes. A higher objective memory leads to greater financial assets including stocks, cash-equivalent, individual retirement accounts, bonds, and thus total financial assets. It also leads to a smaller share in cash-equivalent. Older adults with better objective memory are more likely to have sufficient liquid assets to cover short-term expenses and they save enough to meet retirement adequacy. On the other hand, a higher subjective memory leads to fewer financial assets, retirement inadequacy, and insolvency. These findings have important implications for older adults who experience memory loss, and their families.","This study examines whether objective and subjective memory have an impact on the financial decisions of older adults. It also attempts to identify which of the two measures of memory better explains asset holdings, allocation, and financial health. While cognitive decline among older adults is a natural process of aging, it can adversely influence retirement wealth through a loss of confidence and the capability to make sound financial decisions (Martin et al. 2008, 2019; Triebel et al. 2009). Older adults with cognitive decline and their families may face a substantial financial burden due to healthcare costs and may deplete their accumulated assets.====A growing body of literature has focused on how memory loss can affect financial decisions among older adults. This topic has received more attention among scholars because, as the baby boomer generation (those born between 1946 and 1964) enters retirement, the number of U.S. seniors is expected to grow in absolute and relative terms. According to the Administration for Community Living (2018), American citizens aged 65 or older will increase from 49.2 million to 82.3 million by 2040—a rise from 15.2% to 21.7% of the population.====As a natural consequence of aging, cognitive decline is prevalent among older adults. In 2020, the estimated prevalence rate of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) is 7.8% among those aged 65 or older (5.8 million) and is expected to grow by 140% (13.9 million) in 30 years (Alzheimer’s association 2019). One study estimates that the lifetime risk of ADRD at age 65 is 21% for women and 12% for men (Chêne et al. 2015). Using a nationally representative sample, Fishman (2017) estimates that the probability of developing dementia is 26.9% for an average dementia-free 70-year male and 34.7% for a comparable female. Further, the cost of medical treatments and long-term care for those with ADRD is substantial and likely to drain retirement savings. In 2018, the average annual cost of treating and caring for a person with ADRD was 3.5 times that of those without ADRD – $48,977 vs. $13,976 (Alzheimer’s association 2019).====Poor decisions due to cognitive decline can cause financial vulnerability and insecurity. A body of literature examined how mild cognitive impairment (MCI) correlates with financial capacity (Martin et al. 2008, 2019; Triebel et al. 2009) assessed using several tasks reflecting financial ability. These range from simple tasks such as managing checkbooks and bills to complicated ones such as arranging estates and understanding investment options. Despite the small sample size (<100), the studies found that, at baseline, those with MCI had a lower level of financial capacity than those without MCI, and their financial capacity declined much faster after one (Martin et al., 2008, Triebel et al., 2009) and six years (Martin et al. 2019).====The adverse effect of memory loss is not limited to financial capacity. Some studies show that it extends to wealth and investment skills. Gresenz et al. (2020) found that early-stage ADRD (i.e., the stage at which people show signs of mild cognitive decline before diagnosis) increased the chance of a significant reduction in liquid assets defined as a decrease greater than the 75th or 90th percentile by 5.1 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. An increase in the likelihood of dementia is similarly associated with an increase in the probability of experiencing a considerable drop in non-housing net worth. Moreover, better-than-average investment skills learned over long experience of financial markets depreciates significantly with cognitive decline (Korniotis and Kumar 2011).====By increasing the probability of financial exploitation, cognitive decline can devastate accumulated wealth. Older adults are often targets for financial manipulation, whose prevalence rates vary from 3.5 to 20 percent for those aged 65 or over (Wood and Lichtenberg 2017). While a higher numeracy score is associated with a reduced risk of financial exploitation, victims of fraud, even after accounting for other factors (Wood et al. 2016), are more likely to show a lower cognitive ability measured as a diagnosis of dementia or poor memory and performance in the calculation and executive functioning (Wood et al. 2014). As they experience cognitive decline, older adults and their families might be at risk of adverse effects of poor financial planning.====As a similar concept to memory, researchers have also investigated the effect of cognitive ability on financial decisions. Not surprisingly, lower cognitive abilities are known to lead to financial mistakes and behavioral biases. For example, older adults with cognitive decline are more likely to transfer credit card balances from existing cards to new cards for convenience, take out loans at higher interest rates (Agarwal and Mazumder 2013), fall into a conjunction fallacy (i.e., the tendency to assume that specific events are more probable than single general events) and conservatism (i.e., the tendency not to update personal beliefs and attitudes) (Oechssler et al. 2009).====The present study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, previous research into the effects of memory loss on financial outcomes was largely descriptive. While it is known that education, family background, and other unobservable factors affect memory capacity, it is unclear to what extent the prior findings can be interpreted causally without addressing memory’s endogenous nature. By contrast, this study relies on an instrumental variable (IV) approach to identify a causal connection between memory and the financial decisions of older adults. Based on Mendelian randomization (Davey Smith and Ebrahim, 2003, Davey Smith, 2007), the study uses memory-related genetic traits as instruments for endogenous memory measures. If the necessary assumptions are met, Mendelian randomization states that, after controlling for observable individual characteristics, genetic traits can be considered to be exogenously assigned across individuals. In other words, genetic traits can be a valid instrument for drawing causal inferences. Recent developments in genetics have enabled researchers to use genetic data from a nationally representative sample (Hauser and Weir 2010). However, because genetic traits are time-invariant, this study focuses on ==== in the effects of memory on financial outcomes ==== rather than changes within individuals over time.====Further, the study models the financial decisions of older adults using both ==== and ==== memory measures. While the existing literature relies on objective measures (e.g., ADRD diagnosis), the present study also exploits perceived ability, which might better capture actual ability, particularly if it involves complicated tasks in surveys or questionnaires, such as financial literacy or cognition. This is supported by the literature showing that perceived financial knowledge better explains financial decisions than objective measures of financial literacy (Allgood and Walstad, 2016, Anderson et al., 2017, Bannier and Neubert, 2016, Farrell et al., 2016, Kramer, 2016, Tang and Baker, 2016). Also, subjective memory decline has received increasing attention from researchers who study the pathology of ADRD and MCI because frequent memory loss is an early signal of these conditions (Alzheimer’s Association 2019). Because subjective cognitive decline differs from objective conditions manifested in cognition tests and clinical diagnosis and can occur even before it is noticed (Alzheimer’s Association 2019), the present study attempts to test which measure better explains the asset holdings/allocation and financial health of older adults.====Despite the adverse consequences of cognitive decline, little is known about how memory influences older adults’ complex financial decisions such as asset holdings, portfolio allocation, and financial health. To close this gap in the literature, this study focuses on various components reported in financial statements such as assets, liabilities, and net worth not being limited to the asset-side. This should reveal whether the effects of objective and subjective memory systematically differ across various components reported in the statement, and provide a comprehensive snapshot of the financial status of older adults.====To examine whether objective and subjective memory affect asset holdings/allocation and financial health among older adults, the study uses a longitudinal dataset of the 2000–2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The empirical analysis is based on the IV approach of Lewbel (2012), which allows to obtain robust inference using heteroskedasticity-based instruments. The results show that individuals with higher objective memory scores have a larger amount in stocks, cash-equivalent, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), bonds, and thus total financial assets. They also allocate less wealth to cash-equivalent. Higher objective memory further leads to better financial health as measured by emergency funds and retirement adequacy criteria. On the other hand, subjective memory, in most specifications, does not appear to explain the financial behavior of older adults. Where it occurs, higher subjective memory is generally associated with less desirable financial behaviors such as saving less in total financial assets and being less likely to meet retirement adequacy or solvency.",Objective and subjective memory: Impact on the financial behavior of older adults in the United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000207,24 May 2021,2021,Research Article,55.0

I find that households dissave from their public pension benefits, but not from their contributory pensions, therefore policy increases of contributions are not crowded-out by private decisions. The results show that an increase of the contribution rate plus a delay of the retirement age is necessary to achieve high replacement ratios until 2055. Boosting the education of younger generations and incentives for female employment is efficient for increasing pensions among the poorest households.","Increasing savings in Latin America is one of the most relevant aspects for growth (Cavallo and Serebrisky, 2016), with the compulsory contributions for the pension system being one of the main components of regular savings and a funding source for investment (Cerda et al., 2020). Furthermore, over the last 20years the region experienced a strong demographic dividend, which boosted savings, growth and even a reduction in inequality (Bloom and Canning, 2003, Higgins, 1998, Azevedo et al., 2013). The current demographic transition into an aging society, however, now requires that policy makers attend the needs of a growing population of retirees.====This work shows how the savings rates and pension income of Chilean households are likely to evolve as the result of expected demographic changes over the period 2015 until 2055. To implement this I take into account several economic and demographic changes: (i) the aging of the current population and increased life expectancy of retired workers, (ii) the birth of new generations of households with higher education and labor force attachment, (iii) the higher wages, lower unemployment and lower income volatility that benefit workers as they age, and (iv) the accumulation of assets in terms of their formal contributory pension savings, the expected value of non-contributory public benefits and voluntary household savings. This analysis is particularly important now as Chile is facing several policy reform discussions in Parliament and the pension system became the main issue behind the large social disruption Chile experiences since October 18, 2019 (TheEconomist, 2019, Cortés et al., 2021). The policy situation is also becoming more constrained now, with budget deficits in every year since 2013 and with government debt having increased from 4% of GDP in 2008 to 28% in 2019, which gives less fiscal space for heavy spending in social policy.====The model calibrates the individual contribution accounts of the Chilean pension system, plus the public retirement benefits provided to the lowest income families. Furthermore, it accounts for the marriage and fertility choices of the new households, plus the life-cycle optimization problem of the households to smooth their income and wealth within a framework of no uncertainty and no credit constraints (similar to previous literature, such as Attanasio and Brugiavini, 2003, Attanasio and Rohwedder, 2003). For the estimation I use the Chilean Household Expenditure Survey (in Spanish, ====, hence on EPF) to build a representative sample of the population and of the new generation of 25 year old workers arriving to the labor market in each period. The dynamics of labor force participation, formal versus informal work, unemployment are then calibrated from the Chilean Employment Survey (in Spanish, ====, hence on ENE), according to the workers’ sex, age, education and industry. Finally, the changing life expectancy and population weights of households with different ages are then adjusted over time using forecasts from the United Nations (ECLAC, 2013).====The results from the EPF survey show that the voluntary savings rate is lower for couples and families with children and senior members, but it is increasing with household income. Furthermore, I find that households consume a positive fraction of their expected future earnings and non-contributory pension benefits in each period, although at a lower rate than the predictions of the standard life-cycle model, perhaps due to the presence of income uncertainty and credit constraints (Attanasio and Weber, 2010). However, compulsory pension wealth does not affect voluntary savings rate significantly, perhaps due to tax benefits for formal workers of high income. This is an important result, because it shows that pension reforms that increase the compulsory contribution rate can increase the household sector’s national saving rate without crowding-out the current voluntarily accumulated wealth (Cerda et al., 2020). The model is also shown to explain well the fluctuations in the Chilean savings rate over the last 22years, although it underestimates its mean value,====Simulating the pensions of future cohorts over the period 2015 to 2055, I show that the Chilean pension system is projected to deliver worse replacement ratios in the future, unless policy makers increase retirement age and contribution rates. In particular, the OECD presents 70% as a minimum reference value for the replacement ratio of pension income relative to the previous labor income of the household, which is similar to the replacement ratio range of 65% to 85% recommended in the financial planning literature (OECD, 2012). The baseline results show that after 2025 more than 50% of the newly retired population are expected to be below the target 70% for the replacement ratio of income. Also, after the year 2025 more than 25% of the newly retired households have replacement ratios of 50% or below, which is close to the 40% rate argued by the International Labor Organization (ILO) as a minimum living standard for retirees.====I then test how the pension replacement ratios improve with different policies: (i) increasing the contribution rate from 10% to 13%, (ii) a gradual increase of the retirement age to 67years for both men and women, (iii) an expansion of the college education among the new generations, (iv) improved incentives for female labor participation, and (v) all policies implemented jointly. The results show that an increase of contribution rates implies a strong improvement in pensions. However, this measure takes a long time to take its full impact and this policy may be of limited value if government waits until after 2025 to implement it. Increasing the retirement age of households has a large immediate improvement in household pension income, but its effect systematically wears off after 2030. Improving the education of new generations only has an impact on the generations retiring 40years into the future, but it does have a small impact on improving the pension income of all households, especially among the 10% lowest pension ratios. The recent Female Labor Subsidy program implemented in 2012, however, has a strong impact in improving the pension income of the poorest 25 percentiles of newly retired households and is estimated to increase the pension replacement income of the poorest population of retirees by 5% to 10% by the year 2055.====Increasing contribution rates to 13% and retirement age to 67years jointly appears to be the most adequate policy combination for improving the pension income of Chilean households. This policy combination manages to improve the pension income immediately and to make this improvement sustained over time. Implementing all the four policy alternatives in a joint scenario also insures adequate pension replacement rates, with more than 75% of the newly retired households receiving the target 70% replacement rate or more for their pensions.====This work is related to studies about population aging (d’Albis et al., 2015), savings (ElMekkaouide Freitas and Martins, 2014), long-term demographic projections (Oosthuizen, 2015, Eggink et al., 2017), financial behavior (Madeira, 2018, Madeira, 2019), wealth and inequality (Mejía-Guevara, 2015). Previous work studying the possible pension reforms in Chile (Comisión PresidencialPensiones, 2015) found that an increase in solidarity pensions financed by workers’ contributions can act as a labor tax, decreasing employment and consumption (Santoro, 2017). Relative to those studies (see Santoro, 2017) this work considers an increase in pensions that is entirely driven by an increase of the contributions for the workers’ individual accounts or a delaying of the retirement age. The study also advances upon the literature by simulating the long-run implications of public policy and demographic change until 2055, plus its heterogeneous impact across households.====This study is structured as follows. Section2 explains the household model and its savings options, while Section3 shows the model calibration from survey data. Section4 shows the simulated results under the scenario of no policy change, while Section5 analyzes the potential impact of each policy reform.

In parallel, much research has shown that the relationship between age and well-being traces an approximate U-shape, with a nadir in midlife. Temporary employment may well have different associations with well-being across the lifespan, likely harming people in midlife more than at the start of their working lives. Using over twenty years of the German Socio-economic panel (SOEP), this investigation considers the relationship between temporary employment, age and well-being. In doing so, it both sheds new light on the relationship between temporary employment and well-being, and explores systematic differences for the oft-found U-shaped relationship between age and well-being. The results show that temporary employment deepens the U-shape in midlife, and that this result holds when many socioeconomic factors as well as the ====, region, cohort, personality, worries about the present job and about being able to finding another job are taken into account. Furthermore, the investigation considers transitions between permanent and temporary employment and uses these to assess causation and selection.","Over the past four decades, the labour market in many developed countries has loosened. During this process, one key trend has been the increasing use of temporary employees in many industries. Germany, the country on which this investigation is focused, is no exception. Since the 1980s, use of temporary employment has substantially increased in Germany. Straightforward comparisons between then and now cannot easily be made because both the law around temporary employment and how it is measured in official statistics have changed over this time period. Despite this caveat, the official figures presented in Fig. 1 just below show the change since the early 1990s. In the mid 1990s, the start of the data used for the empirical analysis, around 6% of all employees aged above 25 were temporarily employed. This had increased to about 8.5% in the mid 2010s. Furthermore, Fig. 1 also indicates that it is the young who have experienced this increase in temporary contracts more than any other age range: those employees younger than 34 (but at least 25 years old) have experienced a doubling in their number on temporary contracts. In contrast, the proportion of the middle aged on such contracts has not changed much.==== In general, the overall number of temporary employees in Germany has increased from about 1.2 million in the mid-1990s to just over 3.15 million - the highest on record - in 2017 (Hohendanner, 2018). Germany has consistently had a lower percentage of temporary workers than the average for EU-27 - an average pushed up by outliers Spain and Portugal - and a higher percentage than the other two large European economies, France and the UK.====The reasons for, and consequences of, the increasing use of temporary employment contracts have been widely discussed (von Hippel et al., 1997, Morris and Vekker, 2001, Giesecke and Groß, 2003, Engellandt and Riphahn, 2005, Virtanen et al., 2005, De Cuyper et al., 2008). For an economy, it has been argued that temporary employment is positive for job creation, for integration of people normally outside of the labour market, and for responding to economy-wide seasonal fluctuations (von Hippel et al., 1997, Morris and Vekker, 2001, Engellandt and Riphahn, 2005). For businesses, hiring temporary employees may help them be more flexible and respond to demand fluctuations, make it easier to manage the collective workload, help to reduce hiring and firing costs, and may result in hiring workers keen to impress in pursuit of a permanent position (von Hippel et al., 1997, Morris and Vekker, 2001, Giesecke and Groß, 2003, De Cuyper et al., 2008). However, what is of particular interest in this investigation is how temporary employment may benefit or hinder individuals, which is discussed further in Section “Literature review”.====As also discussed in Section “Literature review”, the balance between these positive and negative aspects is likely to shift based upon where an individual is in her working life. In particular, the negative aspects of a temporary contract seem weighted towards those in midlife rather than those at the start of their career. Despite this likely strong heterogeneity with respect to age, previous investigations into the well-being associations of temporary and permanent employment often control for age, but do not consider it explicitly (see the literature review in section “Literature review” for examples). In contrast, this investigation specifically considers how temporary contracts affect the well-being of individuals in different age ranges, with an especial focus on midlife. This study investigates the issue for Germany, making use of the nationally representative German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP). In the German context under investigation here, a permanent contract might be particularly important for worker well-being due to the high level of dismissal protection, making it difficult for employers to get rid of permanent employees.====Many studies within economics and social science more generally have considered age and well-being, with the majority showing either direct evidence of a midlife low or evidence suggestive of a midlife low (as examples of a much wider literature, Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004, Blanchflower and Oswald, 2008, Cheng et al., 2015, Piper, 2015a, Schwandt, 2016, Clark, 2019, Blanchflower and Graham, 2020) often by considering age as a quadratic or in reasonably small age groups.==== Furthermore, evidence has been put forward that this oft-found U-shape of the relationship between age and well-being is a life cycle effect, while not necessarily ruling out a cohort influence (Piper, 2015a, Clark, 2019). A midlife passage or, as it is more frequently termed, a midlife crisis (the term is often thought to have been coined by a Canadian psychoanalyst in an essay about creativity [Jaques, 1965]) is also a common feature of our culture (see Setiya, 2017, and a recent Royal Society lecture [====] for many examples) and is a source of substantial activity and interest for psychotherapists (for example Hollis, 1993, Polden, 2002, Stein, 2014). This is a literature that suggests that a midlife nadir and turning point has always been a feature of human life.====While largely established empirically, scientifically grounded explanations for this midlife low or nadir have only been a small part of the effort to understand the relationship between age and well-being (with Schwandt, 2016 being an important exception). Whether the U-shape is universal, and are there factors that deepen it or ameliorate it are important issues. Descriptive statistics from the German Socioeconomic Panel suggest both the existence of a midlife lull and a sizeable difference in the depth of this lull between temporary and permanent employees (defined via a survey question that asks individuals about their contract type). The following figure presents average life satisfaction ratings (positively coded on a 0–10 scale) from over twenty years of annual nationally representative German data. The raw averages are suggestive of a deepening of the U-shape for temporary employees when compared to permanent employees. With a difference of about a quarter of a point in midlife, this deepening is substantial.====Most studies that investigate well-being associations with temporary and permanent employment contracts account for age as a control variable, thus obtaining results that do not consider or permit identification of the impact of age on these associations (Bardasi and Francesconi, 2004, Silla et al., 2005, Green and Heywood, 2011, Dawson et al., 2015, Dawson et al., 2017). In contrast, this investigation adds to the evidence of these (and other studies) by considering potential systematic differences in well-being between temporary and permanent employees at different ages and, in doing so, provides new evidence. The next section, Section “Literature review”, considers the literature and theory regarding age, life satisfaction and type of employment contract. Section “Data and methodology” describes the data used and the methods employed. Section “Results” presents and discusses the results. Additionally, Section “Results” contains analyses that attempt to provide evidence regarding selection and causation.

As a result, there is a growing debate on what type of reforms to the current defined-pension system could balance the long-term funding of the system with insuring benefit levels for old and new beneficiaries. In this paper, we develop and estimate a dynamic behavioral model that captures essential elements of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and behavioral responses in labor supply, savings and benefit claiming to changes in the public pension system using a nationally-representative sample of married couples nearing retirement from the Korean ====.","The Republic of Korea faces a rapidly aging population that will be more reliant on public pension support. Between 2015 and 2060, the dependency ratio (the proportion of people aged 65 and older relative to those of working age) is forecast to rise from 17.3 to 80.6 percent (Statistics Korea, 2015).==== The National Pension Scheme (NPS), introduced in 1988 for government employees, has been subsequently expanded to cover the whole working population of Korea. In the absence of well-developed corporate pension plans, the NPS is currently the primary pillar for retirement incomes and the main social insurance scheme for the elderly.====Despite its increased coverage over time, the NPS system is facing a dual challenge of ensuring adequate benefit levels and maintaining the system’s funding. The current replacement rate for an average earner in South Korea is 45 percent, compared with 57 percent in the group of 34 OECD countries. More than half of the population aged 65 and over lives in==== ====relative poverty. In 2008, the first cohort qualified for full retirement benefits under NPS rules started receiving benefits. Prior to 2008, there were relatively few beneficiaries per contributor and these beneficiaries had a limited contribution history, leading to low benefits. As the system matures, a broader proportion of the working population are becoming beneficiaries. Reforms, most recently in 1998 and 2007, have reduced benefit levels for future generations in an effort to adequately finance future benefits. More reforms are expected given significant perceived liabilities for the system (e.g., Yonhap News Agency, 2018).====Two policy options that have been considered to improve the long-term financing of the defined-benefit pension system are an increase in the normal retirement age and further increases in the contribution rate. However, economic models of intertemporal household decision-making predict that both types of schemes are likely to influence labor supply and savings behaviors, which might potentially counteract the intended effects of these reforms in improving the fiscal sustainability of the NPS system. If contributions to pensions are perceived as a tax, an increase in the contribution rate might disincentivize labor supply and encourage early retirement (Blundell et al., 1998, Keane, 2011). Moreover, increases in contributions might crowd-out household savings if public and pension savings are substitutable (Attanasio and Brugiavini, 2003, Attanasio and Rohwedder, 2003), and an increase in the normal retirement age in an economy with imperfect capital markets and borrowing constraints is likely to delay retirement (van der Klaauw and Wolpin, 2008, Stock and Wise, 1990).====Predicting the effects of these policies in the context of the NPS is challenging. Because of the short history of the NPS, it is not possible to adopt a quasi-experimental approach using data from previous changes to the system to anticipate the effects of these reforms on retirement and savings behavior. Instead, we develop and estimate a dynamic behavioral model that captures behavioral responses to changes in the NPS system as these individuals approach retirement, and we use the estimated model structural parameters to simulate the labor supply and household savings effects of alternative policies. Our approach will also allow us to evaluate heterogeneous impacts of proposed policy changes based on accumulated savings near retirement. The dynamic behavioral model that we propose is used to answer the following policy questions:====Quantifying changes in work and savings decisions is important for a comprehensive evaluation of pension reforms, as there is substantial evidence of responsiveness of workers to changes in the pension benefit structure in other countries. In the United States, 15–20 percent of male workers at age 61 retire at age 62 - the age of first benefit eligibility (Coile and Gruber, 2007, Gustman and Steinmeier, 2005), suggesting that retirement behavior does respond to the structure of the pension system. More recently, van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2008) find that an increase in the social security payroll tax to 15% would significantly reduce labor participation and working hours, with larger effects on single rather than married individuals, and on males rather than females. They also estimate positive effects in hours worked due to the elimination of early retirement. Attanasio and Rohwedder, 2003, Attanasio and Brugiavini, 2003 find pension reforms that increase the generosity of the public pension have substantial negative effects on private savings in the UK and Italy, respectively. Joubert, 2015, Attanasio et al., 2014 find that an increase in benefits in a means-tested, non-earnings related pension scheme substantially reduced both labor supply and participation in formal labor markets in Chile.====The possibility of unintended consequences motivates the use of our dynamic behavioral model as an important tool for evaluating changes to the NPS old-age pension. Our behavioral model accommodates households that differ in observed characteristics and incorporates unobserved heterogeneity in preferences for consumption and labor supply driving choices. Furthermore, the model is dynamic in order to capture that individuals face a tradeoff between retiring early and receiving reduced pension benefits for the duration of their life, or delaying retirement and receiving greater pension benefits once they do retire. Finally, the linking of an individual's choices across time through the structure of the NPS allows current choices to be influenced by uncertainty individuals face regarding their future health and longevity. For instance, if an individual stops working and claims his or her NPS old-age pension at age 55, he or she receives an immediate benefit; however, delaying benefit claiming until age 65 means a 94.2 percent greater benefit level. An individual's lifetime benefits will only be greater from delaying benefits from age 55 to 65 if he or she survives until age 80.====In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to examine life-cycle behavioral responses in labor supply, savings and retirement decisions to proposed policy changes in the public pension system in Korea, and estimate the model for a sample of married couples nearing retirement from the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Aging survey (KLoSA) continuously observed for the period 2006–2012. We restrict the sample based on the characteristics we considered to be most common to the expected NPS beneficiary: a married couple where at least one individual is in a work-place insured occupation (or a wage earner) as of 2006. To estimate the model parameters that best fit the observed patterns in the data, we use the Method of Simulated Moments (Blundell et al., 2016, McFadden, 1989). Using the estimated model parameters, we simulate household responses in labor supply and savings to a few proposed policy changes: (1) an immediate increase in contribution rate by 2 percentage points, (2) a gradual increase in contribution rate by 2 percentage points over five years, and (3) an increase in retirement age by two years. Finally, we use the simulated labor supply responses to policy changes to provide a benefit-cost analysis of their implementation and the consequences for the long-term fundability of the pension system.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the institutional framework. The third section describes the data. The fourth section introduces the details of the life-cycle model we estimate. The fifth section discusses the estimation results in relation with predictions from economic theory and evaluate the model’s goodness of fit. The sixth section presents the counterfactual policy experiments. The final section concludes with a discussion of key findings and directions for future research.","A dynamic behavioral model of Korean saving, work, and benefit claiming decisions",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000153,27 March 2021,2021,Research Article,58.0

Other potential confounders before, during, and after the Cultural Revolution do not fully explain the positive relationship. I also find that political violence could influence future savings through its effect on factors internal to the individual, but that external factors do not play a role. Finally, I identify that persistence is lower in regions with nowadays higher economic openness and a better rule of law.","China has long been regarded as a country with the highest level of household savings in the world, even after it became the second largest economic entity in 2011. Though fueling the China’s investment led economic growth, the extraordinarily high savings are associated with under-consumption in the meantime. Previous research has investigated the issue from the aspects such as income uncertainty (Chamon and Prasad, 2010), competitive motivation in the marriage market (Wei and Zhang, 2011), the burden of education and healthcare expenditures (Chamon et al., 2013), housing price (Wang and Wen, 2012), demographic structure (Curtis et al., 2015), and household registration system (Chen et al., 2015). This paper attempts to provide a new perspective by exploring whether certain historical traits such as political violence which has been argued remarkably persistent and important for explaining current economic outcomes (Voigtländer and Voth, 2012, Couttenier et al., 2019, D’Acunto et al., 2019), can help investigate the high level of savings of Chinese residents nowadays.====Political violence is violence perpetrated by citizens or governments to achieve political goals.==== It influences people’s health, income, and education and these outcomes jointly affect a nation’s development (Blattman and Miguel, 2010). In the context of savings, empirical researches find a positive relationship between political violence and household savings in the short run, which is in line with a precautionary motivation (Aaberge et al., 2017, Giesing and Musić, 2019). Experimental evidence shows that potentially violent experiences are associated with risk aversion and thus higher savings balances (Callen et al., 2014). The present study further addresses the issue and examines the long-run impact of political violence on household savings, using empirical evidence from the Cultural Revolution (CR), an influential political movement in Mainland China from May 1966 to October 1976.====China has suffered considerably in modern history. External aggressions and internal conflicts did not end until China’s reform and opening up policy was implemented in 1978. Of these, the latest one was the CR, among which the first six years saw the severest violence.==== Conflicts between civilians swept across the country and damaged the society to a significant degree (MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, 2006). Although the movement was totally denied after it was suspended, it shaped several generations deeply. Given the rich set of the literature introducing the movement, I simply point out two aspects of the CR which were most relevant to this study.====First, a typical characteristic of the violence during the CR was the arbitrary identification of “class enemies” (i.e., those who were “==== to be disloyal to the Party or lacking in revolutionary spirit”) (Bai and Wu, 2020, p.4.). All individuals were thus faced with the possibility of being criticized or denounced, which resulted in dramatic uncertainty and widespread victimization. It is generally accepted in psychology that people’s catastrophic experiences have long-term effects on their internal beliefs and preferences (Freud, 1986, Kendler et al., 2002, Shi, 2010), which are among the fundamental determinants of savings and consumption behavior (Voors et al., 2012).==== Experimental evidence has documented that violence victims, when primed to recall fear, increase their preferences for certainty, resulting in a higher level of savings (Callen et al., 2014).====Second, two features of the CR allowed me to construct a natural setting to identify the effects of political violence. The first was its unexpected occurrence, which was unrelated to economic difficulties, but rather a political orientation to expel bourgeois elements from society. Most people initially did not even know what happened and what would happen (MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, 2006). The other was its disordered development: it was not controlled by any level of government; rather, the political violence was casual and irregular nationwide. These facts led to the quasi-random distribution of political violence in different regions (Bu, 2008, Walder, 2014, Bai and Wu, 2020).====Combined with the argument that specific cohorts were more affected by the violence than others, I use the province-by-cohort variation to explore the long-lasting influence of political violence on savings decisions nowadays. Specifically, I adopt a generalized difference-in-difference (DID) setting using the unanticipated and large-scale natural experiment (i.e., the CR). The advantage of the DID strategy is that comparing the savings rates within each province across cohorts differences out the time-invariant province characteristics, while comparing the savings rates within each cohort across provinces differences out the changes over time that shocked the cohort similarly.====The measure of political violence during the CR is based on the first principal components of three variables (the rates of victimization, injury, and death), each of which is calculated as the average ratio of people who suffered to the total population in each jurisdiction in a province. The data come from China Political Events Dataset (Walder, 2014). Combined with the household-level economic data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), I find that political violence had a long-lasting positive influence on savings rates nowadays for affected cohorts. To mitigate the concern that other factors systematically not only relate to the affected cohorts and political violence in each province but also influence savings decisions nowadays, I argue that considering potential confounders before, during, and after the CR leaves the baseline results largely unchanged. Moreover, falsification tests and other robustness tests such as modifying the definition of affected cohorts, considering the migration of samples, dividing cohorts by cognitive development stage, and using alternative indicators of political violence provide additional support for the baseline estimation.====Furthermore, by exploiting that (1) the savings decisions of cohorts born after the CR are not influenced by the political violence during the CR, and (2) the savings decisions of cohorts relocating to another region after the CR are not influenced by the political violence in the region to which they migrate, I attribute the mechanism of the positive relationship between political violence and household savings to the factors internal to individuals such as preferences, beliefs, and values, but not external changes in administrative system and social structures. I exclude some internal channels such as trust, evaluation of the government, social interaction, and future expectations. Meanwhile, I give ==== evidence that political violence influences household savings ==== by affecting people’s risk tolerance. Finally, I explore the persistence of political violence and the conditions under which the effect could diminish over time. I find that ==== higher economic openness and a ==== better legal environment, rather than economic success itself, can lower the high savings levels caused by past exposure to political violence.====This study is also related to the following two strands of the literature. First, it extends research that uses historical factors to explain present-day outcomes (Acemoglu et al., 2011, Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2013, Nunn, 2014, Pierce and Snyder, 2017). In particular, this study relates to the literature describing the long-lasting influence of exposure to shocks such as recessions, conflicts, and bad governance, as surveyed by Blattman and Miguel (2010). For instance, Miguel et al. (2011) find a positive relationship between the degree of civil conflict in a soccer player’s home country and his/her propensity to behave violently in European professional leagues. Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2014) find that people who suffered a recession in their early years are more likely to believe that success relies on luck than effort, vote for left-wing parties, and favor governmental redistribution. Akbulut-Yuksel and Yuksel (2015) argue that school-aged children during the persecutions in Nazi Germany have fewer schooling years in adulthood. Couttenier et al. (2019) find that individuals exposed to conflict during childhood tend to commit violent crimes and that integration policies can mitigate the negative effects of past conflict exposure.====Among this strand of the literature, two studies are most relevant to mine. The first is Malmendier and Nagel (2011), who point out that individuals who experienced low stock returns in the past are less likely to show risk-taking behavior, as reflected by their lower probability of investing in the stock market and lower proportion of liquid assets invested in stocks. They also argue that beliefs about future returns can be a potential channel. The other one is D’Acunto et al. (2019), who find that households in counties with high historical antisemitism have lower savings deposits and invest less in stock markets, but show similar savings rates. However, the mechanism behind the relationship is distrust in the financial sector, in which Jews specialized historically. Unlike the literature above, the present research focuses on political violence using a chaotic movement whose occurrence was unrelated to economic conditions (in contrast to the origin of historical antisemitism) and employs the natural experiment to explain the high savings rates in the context of China.====Second, one stream of the literature exploring the CR focuses on its impact on education and human capital and discusses the effect on economic decisions (e.g., Meng and Gregory, 2002, Meng and Gregory, 2007, Zhang et al., 2007, Zhong, 2016, Chen et al., 2019). Most such studies document a significantly adverse impact of the CR on human capital accumulation as well as returns to schooling.==== Other studies explore the influence of the CR from such aspects as altruism, favoritism, and guilt (Li et al., 2010), the external locus of control (Gong et al., 2015), and inter-personal trust (Bai and Wu, 2020). Few focus on political violence itself. One exception is Bai and Wu (2020), who document that exposure to violence lowers inter-personal trust. Unlike the literature, the present study focuses on the political violence during the CR to explore its influence on present-day household savings decisions, which I argue could be (partly) explained by risk tolerance.====The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section “Data, variables and descriptive statistics” describes the variables and datasets. Section “Identification strategy and baseline results” discusses the regression model, identification strategy, and baseline results, followed by the results of the robustness tests in Section “Robustness tests”, the channel exploration in Section “Exploration for the potential channels”, and the correlates of persistence in Section “Difference in the persistence of political violence”.

This study shows that children react to a parent’s need for long-term care. Likewise, children are also expected to react to changes in the availability of publicly paid long-term care services.","By 2060, 10% of the total population in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries will be above the age of 80 (OECD, 2020). Therefore, the need for long-term care (LTC) is expected to increase significantly (Colombo et al., 2011). In 2015, the World Health Organization proposed strategies to guide the development of an effective system of LTC. These strategies include, among others, enabling aging in place. Aging in place, that is, the ability to live in one’s home or community safely and independently as one ages (Morley, 2012), is a common preference among elderly people (Lehnert et al., 2019). However, aging in place requires a wide array of public care services and a family of caregivers. Therefore, future LTC policies need to ensure a sufficient supply of formal and informal caregivers (World Health Organization, 2015).====Yet, before reshaping publicly financed LTC services, it is important to understand how intergenerational transfers within the family change once a family member needs LTC. An expansion of publicly financed LTC services can have very different effects, depending on the transmission mechanism within the family. While an expansion of formal LTC services reduces informal LTC services or financial support provided by the family if family members are altruistically motivated, this is not necessarily the case if support is motivated by other factors such as dual exchange over the life cycle (Cox and Rank, 1992).====Cross-sectional evidence has shown that inter vivos transfers from adult children to their elderly parents, whether in time or financial form, are of economic importance in developed countries (Arrondel and Masson, 2006). Across OECD countries, more than one third of informal caregivers are children who provide unpaid care to parents who need LTC (Colombo et al., 2011). In general, children may provide inter vivos transfers to parents who need LTC for various reasons. A number of studies shows that inter vivos transfers from young to old are positively associated with parental ill health (Alessie et al., 2014, Bonsang, 2007, Checkovich and Stern, 2002, Ciani and Deiana, 2018, Grundy, 2005, Lopez-Anuarbe, 2013). This could be due to children’s altruism toward their elderly parents, that is, children care about their parents’ well-being. However, dual exchange over the life cycle may also be important. Children are more likely to provide some form of LTC to their parents if they contemporaneously receive financial transfers (Bonsang, 2007, Leopold and Raab, 2011, Norton et al., 2014, Norton and Van Houtven, 2006) or if they received transfers in monetary or non-monetary form in the past (Ciani and Deiana, 2018, Evandrou et al., 2018, Henretta et al., 1997, Silverstein et al., 2002).====Studies that address inter vivos transfers from young to old usually focus on a single point in time. However, this makes it difficult to understand how children respond to a parent’s need for LTC. It is unclear if parents in need always – no matter how well-off they are – receive transfers from their adult children, if adult children function as a family safety net, or if children only transfer resources to their parents in need if they received sufficient parental support, either in the past, the present, or expect to receive it in the future. Parent-to-child transfers and parents’ wealth and income likely matter in a child’s decision to provide inter vivos transfers to a parent who needs LTC but are often unobservable by researchers. In our study, we aim to address this gap and examine how inter vivos transfers from adult children to elderly parents change once a parent needs LTC using longitudinal data from the German Family Panel (pairfam).====Children’s reaction to parents’ need for LTC is influenced by the way societies interpret the responsibility for LTC. In some countries, families and friends are mainly responsible for LTC, whereas in other countries, public LTC insurance systems are well developed. Germany is a country with a relatively high level of public support. Germany’s mandatory LTC insurance secures a basic provision of LTC services. However, these services often do not fully cover the care recipient’s demand of LTC. The remaining demand of care needs to be supplied by the family or formal care can be purchased at the care recipient’s own expense. The LTC insurance pays lump-sum benefits that depend on individuals’ level of disability and the daily time required for personal care. Care recipients can choose between home and institutional care. If home care is preferred, care recipients have a choice between cash and service benefits. Cash benefits are paid to the care recipient directly who, in turn, is free to pass these on to a caregiver. If the care recipient prefers formal care and service benefits do not sufficiently cover the actual costs, the care recipient, the care recipient’s spouse, or the care recipient’s lineal descendants (i.e., children) have to pay out of pocket. The care recipient can apply for social welfare if the care recipient’s or the spouse’s and children’s income is not sufficient (Häcker and Hackmann, 2012, Nadash et al., 2018). This implies that children may have to pay for their parents’ formal LTC services or provide LTC themselves, regardless of coresidence with the parent. However, allowances are relatively high such that children are often exempted from paying out of pocket. The care recipient’s decision in favor of formal or informal care might be driven by financial aspects because out-of-pocket expenses for institutional care can be high. But the availability or absence of informal caregivers can also be important. From a caregiver’s perspective, financial incentives that arise from cash payments provided by Germany’s LTC insurance system are rather low (Schmitz and Westphal, 2017). Therefore, a child’s decision to provide inter vivos transfers may be driven by feelings of responsibility or pleasure in providing care to family members, by reasons of reciprocity, or by future expected bequests.====In our study, we analyze the effect of a parent’s need for LTC on inter vivos transfers from adult children to their parents using fixed effects (FE) models. We distinguish transfers in the form of emotional support, financial support, and household help. With the exception of “within-family” FE models as originally used by Henretta et al. (1997), FE models have rarely been used in the literature on inter vivos transfers (McGarry, 2016). The longitudinal nature of the 2008-launched German Family Panel, its strong focus on intergenerational relationships, and its questions on parents’ need for LTC constitute an opportunity to analyze intergenerational transfers in response to LTC needs. In addition, the FE approach allows us to account for time-invariant factors that may affect a child’s caregiving decision and that can thus substantially affect parameter estimates. These factors include past and expected future parent-to-child transfers as well as parents’ permanent wealth and income.====In addition to a child’s emotional support, financial support, and household help, we also investigate which factors are associated with a child’s help with personal care (that is, eating, dressing, bathing, or going to the toilet). According to economic theory, additional sources of support can crowd out a child’s help with personal care if a child’s help with personal care is altruistically motivated. Moreover, a child may provide help with personal care in exchange for parent-to-child inter vivos transfers. As one major concern of an aging population is that the future demand of LTC will not be met and help with personal care is a major part of LTC, the determinants of this kind of transfer are especially important.",A longitudinal perspective on inter vivos transfers between children and their parents in need of long-term care,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000189,23 March 2021,2021,Research Article,60.0

Our study avoids such biases by utilizing an origin–destination framework, which compares the health of emigrants with compatriots who remain in the origin country. Isolating cultural effects can best gauge the effects of migration and of living abroad on the health of migrants. We study both the physical and mental dimensions of health among European-born emigrants over 50, who originate from seven European countries and live in fourteen different destination countries in Europe. We test three hypotheses concerning self-selection, adaptation, and compositional influences with data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and apply multi-level modeling. For physical health we find positive self-selection, beneficial adaptation effects, and effects from other observables for some but not all countries. For mental health, we cannot confirm self-selection, with the notable exception of German émigrés, while additional years abroad and other characteristics have only weak effects. On balance, living abroad has a favorable impact on the health of older European emigrants. Free intra-European mobility and the economic similarity of European countries appear to reduce the role of self-selection in health and to improve the migration experience. Our results are robust to several tests.","Selection is inherent in migration. Selection in health is of vital importance because health is a central element of human capital that can increase productivity and strengthen immigrant success in the host country. It is a good measure of the quality of the labor force and of population well-being and can shape migration. Human capital theory postulates that the most physically and mentally fit who have courage and fortitude will be self-selected to emigrate because they have the most to gain (Constant, 2017). For international migrants, the migration journey can further shape their health. Trepidations and unforeseen events may jeopardize the health of migrants who may become discouraged or unwell and return home. Health screenings imposed by destination countries can further intensify positive selection. Thus, emigrants may have better health than the population that stays in the home country; such selection processes may contribute to geographic health disparities.====Health assimilation studies compare international emigrants from different parts of the world, who are typically young, single, and with not much accumulated education, to natives in the same host country. In general, they find that immigrants have better health than natives (Constant et al., 2018, Farré, 2016, Kennedy et al., 2015, Antecol and Bedard, 2006), although their socioeconomic status is low (Razum and Twardella, 2002, Jasso et al., 2004, Jasso, 2013). With few exceptions, as immigrants stay longer in the host country, are exposed to the new environment, and face adversities, their health advantage dissipates, their health deteriorates, and it may even become worse than that of natives (Hall and Cuellar, 2016, Constant et al., 2018, Giuntella and Stella, 2017) especially as they reach old age (Carnein et al., 2015). This phenomenon is known as the ==== (HIP).====Although depression is a common mental disorder, the primary cause of disability worldwide, and contributes to the overall global burden of disease (WHO, 2020), the mental health of immigrants has not been adequately studied. Depression, also linked to slower recovery from physical illness, can exacerbate the already age-amplified cardiovascular risk (Karasz et al., 2019). Findings about the mental health of immigrants are mixed. In Europe, immigrants experience increased rates of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress syndrome (Aichberger et al., 2010, Carta et al., 2005, Milewski and Doblhammer, 2015), but in the U.S. they are less likely to experience these disorders or to report parental history of psychiatric problems (Salas-Wright et al., 2018).====The literature about the multidimensional processes of aging and migration is equally thin and inconclusive. Older migrants have poorer overall health at arrival, a higher risk for developing health problems, and a sharper health decline in later life when they migrate at older ages (Gubernskaya, 2014, Solé-Auró and Crimmins, 2008). Other studies find that older immigrants experience improved well-being, are socially active and economically productive members in their new societies (Kristiansen et al., 2016, King et al., 2017). In fact, immigrants over 65 with longer residence in the U.S. have a health advantage (Markides et al., 2008/9, Choi, 2012). But a physical health advantage does not prevent older migrants from facing substantially higher rates of depression; time since immigration does not appear to mitigate depressive symptoms (Ladin and Reinhold, 2013).====The rarity of appropriate data on the characteristics of emigrants (both before and after migration) and those who stay in the homeland has hampered empirical research on self-selection and made it difficult to distinguish between initial social and cultural effects and the role of the journey and the duration of residence abroad. Studies that compare the health of free-will emigrants with the health of compatriots who remain in their home country are valuable in disentangling these confounding effects. So far, there is only a handful of such studies, and they provide varying results. Positive self-selection was very weak among young Mexican emigrants going to the U.S. (Rubalcava et al., 2008). Self-selection aside, better mental health was found among the Portuguese in Switzerland (Binder and Simões, 1980) and the Tongans in New Zealand (Stillman et al., 2009). Although Polish emigrants in Germany had similar mental distress levels as their co-ethnics in Poland, they had better physical health (Morawa and Erim, 2015). In contrast, the Irish in the UK were both negatively self-selected and had worse mental health than the Irish in Ireland (Delaney et al., 2013), while European-born emigrants in Europe experienced negative long-tern effects on their cognitive abilities (Gruber, 2020).====Our study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate both the physical and mental health of older European-born emigrants, who live in other European host countries, and compare their health to that of native-stayers in the respective countries of origin. It makes four novel contributions: First, it advances nascent research on emigrant-stayer frameworks that compare emigrants to their counterparts who remain in the home country. The critical advantage of this framework is that it compares demographic groups, which share many attributes, culture, and language due to a similar shared socialization context before emigration. Comparing likes-for-likes==== separates cultural effects from the impact of specific effects on health due to migration or to living in the host country. Our study extends beyond previous studies that compare emigrants in one host country to their counterparts in the home country. It examines the health of emigrants in fourteen different host countries with their respective co-ethnics in seven different native countries.====The emigrant-stayer framework also reduces the bias inherently involved in responding to and misinterpreting questions in cross-country comparisons. Answers to perceived health are difficult to interpret when we compare people across different countries, because we do not know if a deterioration in health, for example, is due to an actual change in health or to a different perception of health stemming from social and cultural factors or both. By comparing emigrants to native-stayers we avoid such bias. Our database, the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), allows us to implement this framework. In fact, exploring SHARE for this kind of analysis has somewhat the character of a pilot study. Thus, in addition, our study provides a different angle to utilizing the SHARE data.====Second, we encompass two essential dimensions of health into our study, as “health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (====). The first dimension is general physical health, which is self-rated; it ranges from “excellent” (1) to “poor” (5). The second dimension is mental health, gauged by a depression index that varies from “no depression” (0) to “full-blown depression” (12). Our study can test whether the health of emigrants compared to respective native-stayers varies by physical or mental health aspects, and provide insights into the complexities of health.====Third, we contribute to the literature about the health of middle-aged and older populations. Similar to natives, immigrants are ‘aging in place’ with longer stay in the host countries. But there are also atypical migrants, who migrate at middle-age and move across borders to seize opportunities. It is of great economic and socio-political importance to understand the health of older people so that societies can more efficiently cater to their needs and design cost-effective policies. The health of older immigrants can “potentially offer some significant analytical advantages for understanding the origins of health disparities in any population” (Jasso et al., 2004, p. 1). SHARE permits us to study the health of people over 50 in several European countries. Because emigrants have different lengths of stay and migrate in different periods, we can study a part of life when health deteriorates in general and group differences may become more pronounced.====Fourth, we enrich the internal or interstate migration literature and exploit the self-selection hypothesis when there are no borders between sovereign origin and destination countries. All countries in our sample are members of the European Union (EU) and Schengen Treaty that guarantee the freedom of movement of people among member-states without passports and border screenings as well as they guarantee the right to work and reside within any country in the EU. Studying self-selection under these circumstances is most informative, because there are no forced or tied-movers and no forced or tied-stayers. It can also detect any spatial health disparities caused by migration. The EU natural experiment of no national borders is similar to that of the U.S., but it differs in that EU-states are sovereign countries with their own language, currency, health care systems, welfare and social insurance; cultural differences are therefore especially central in the EU context. Furthermore, EU-states have similar socioeconomic development levels, age distributions, and political systems. Lastly, our multi-level modeling enables us to correct for country differences as well as for variability within and in-between persons.",Self-selection in physical and mental health among older intra-European migrants,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000165,21 March 2021,2021,Research Article,61.0

Our big data are essential to extract the signal from the noise that has marred many previous studies. While average productivity stays flat, we find variation according to task complexity. Productivity increases with age in teams with more demanding tasks and decreases in routine tasks.","The development of productivity in an aging population is a key issue for the economics of aging. It stands in the middle of a yet unresolved controversy (e.g., Lee, 2014, Lee and Mason, 2010). On the pessimistic side, some see population aging as a major threat to economic growth and a reason for secular stagnation and the observed productivity slowdown (e.g., Gordon, 2016, Summers, 2013, Feyrer, 2007). This pessimistic view is built on the notion that aging economies dispose of fewer human resources than young economies. Since population aging has so far resulted in an aging of the workforce but not in its shrinking, a necessary condition for the validity of this argument is that older workers were less productive than their younger peers. The belief that older workers are less productive is widespread and influences discussions about aging, employers’ personnel decisions (e.g., Lahey, 2008) and employees’ retirement choices, especially in Europe.====Others, however, are more optimistic and argue that better education and other cohort effects (e.g., Kwon et al., 2010) and the emerging opportunities created by new technologies (e.g., robots or artificial intelligence) will dwarf demographic effects (e.g., Kluge et al., 2014, Mokyr, 2014, Glaeser, 2014). Moreover, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) studied the relation between conventional measures of aging and GDP per capita. They found no negative relation and argue that directed technical change has compensated for an aging workforce because demographic change has provided an incentive to invest more in automation.====The microeconometric evidence on age-productivity profiles is controversial as well and often inconclusive since important human resources of older individuals (e.g., experience and size and quality of network) are hard to measure as will be discussed below. In an earlier study published in this journal, we have argued that good management makes productivity essentially independent of age in taylorized standard manufacturing jobs (Börsch-Supan and Weiss, 2016). However, this finding refers to only a small share of jobs in modern economies.====This paper complements Acemoglu and Restrepo’s macroeconomic findings and our earlier research by providing microeconometric evidence from the service industry. Our main result is striking: We find that the age-productivity profile averaged over all tasks is flat and this can be estimated fairly precisely in spite of the heterogeneity of jobs in our sample. These results are based on an innovative identification strategy, which overcomes the methodological difficulties that have marred so many previous studies as will be discussed below. It purges the data from selectivity and other biases by only exploiting the variation in the assignment of workers to work teams while differences between workers and differences between teams are removed by fixed effects for individual-team pairs.====Our findings pertain to a wide range of tasks that are typical for the service industry. We find that the age-productivity profile differs considerably among different types of work tasks. It is flat for the large majority of tasks. However, the age-productivity profile increases in all age groups in the units with intellectually more demanding tasks, while we observe the opposite phenomenon for basic routine tasks. Hence, work content has a considerable influence on the relationship between age and productivity. This observation also suggests that experience offsets the physical and, presumably more relevant, cognitive decline well after the age of 60 in the more demanding tasks.====Labor economists have been interested in estimating age-productivity profiles for a long time (e.g., Mark, 1957, or Kutscher and Walker, 1960)====. Indeed, numerous empirical studies have been published on the subject. They face a host of methodological challenges which are summarized in Göbel and Zwick, 2012, Börsch-Supan and Weiss, 2016. The largest challenge is selectivity. Less productive workers are likely to leave the company earlier; the remaining workers are then a positive selection. Another positive selection occurs when managers assign easier tasks to workers who become less productive. The same happens if workers self-select into easier jobs when they become less productive. If workers were to become less productive with age, these selectivity effects would upwardly bias the slope of the age-productivity profile, i.e., they would suggest a rising profile when it is flat or a flat one when it is negative.====Our contribution to this literature avoids these methodological shortcomings by employing an innovative identification strategy that exploits the day-to-day variation in team composition, while removing differences between workers and differences between teams by fixed effects for individual-team pairs. This eliminates the variation responsible for the various selectivity biases that have marred much of the previous estimates of the age-productivity relation. In order to detect the remaining small productivity signal, we use a very large panel data set of an internationally operating financial company with a wide range of tasks typical for the service industry.====We classify previous research into three types. The first type uses wage and salary data or manager evaluations as a measure of individual productivity (e.g., Kotlikoff and Gokhale, 1992, Laitner and Stolyarov, 2005, McEvoy and Cascio, 1989). Both measures reflect productivity to some extent but have major drawbacks: The widespread use of pay schemes, and especially seniority-based pay scales, means wages will often increase, and, more importantly, rarely fall, with increasing age regardless of the progression of productivity. Hence, the relationship between age and productivity may be positively biased. By contrast, subjective evaluations may be distorted in the opposite direction if a substantial share of manager evaluations is influenced by the aforementioned belief that older workers are less productive. Moreover, this individualistic approach neglects the fact that work is often organized in work teams or units. More experienced, and therefore often older, employees may devote some of their time to helping their younger colleagues, thereby increasing their peers’ productivity at the cost of their own.====The second type of study relates plant-level productivity figures to the age structure of these plants (e.g., Hellerstein and Neumark, 1995, Haltiwanger et al., 1999, Hellerstein et al., 1999, Daveri and Maliranta, 2007). Whereas both are relatively accurate and directly observable, for example, from balance sheets and personnel records, the first shortcoming of this approach is that the age structure of a plant might be endogenous because it is partly a function of the plant’s productivity. More productive firms are usually more profitable and therefore often expand and increase their workforce. Because new hires are likely to be younger (Quimet and Zarutskie, 2013), the workforce of more productive firms rejuvenates relative to the less productive firms. The second shortcoming is that plant-level figures aggregate over heterogeneous jobs and positions. For example, the productivity of production workers on the shop floor could peak, on average, earlier than that of managers who might still have ambitions for a top-level position. Hence, averaging over all possibly very different and non-linear age-productivity profiles within a plant is likely to create aggregation biases, especially considering that in plant-level analysis, individuals might have varying impacts on the overall output.====The third type of study is based on direct productivity measures, for example, the number of publications in academic research (Oster and Hamermesh, 1998), Nobel Prizes (Jones, 2010), the value of artists’ paintings (Galenson and Weinberg, 2001), performance in sports (Fair, 1994), or the number and quality of completed court cases (Backes-Gellner et al., 2011). Although these studies assess productivity quite accurately, they are limited in terms of the range of professions they can feasibly measure. Moreover, these studies typically focus on individual top performers who probably differ from the average worker and a normal work setting.====Börsch-Supan and Weiss (2016, “BSW”) study age and productivity in a truck assembly plant to address these issues directly. The authors use a physical productivity measure that pertains to “normal” work, namely, not top performers but average workers in work settings found in many companies, and their unit of observation is work teams, that is, an aggregation level between the individual and an entire plant. BSW exploit the day-to-day variation of the team composition and adjust for team- and individual-level heterogeneity by team and individual fixed effects. They find no decline in productivity in the age range between 25 and 65 years for this specific blue-collar production work type. The limitation of their study, however, is its focus on a single plant in auto manufacturing with a relatively homogenous set of tasks.====This paper uses a similar methodology as BSW and applies it to a large set of tasks in the service industry. Although jobs in manufacturing may require more physical strength, dexterity, and agility, which tend to decline with age, the manufacturing sector has become less relevant, especially in countries with the most severe demographic aging. By contrast, the service-industry sector is expanding not only in economic importance and share of the labor force, but also in terms of the diversity of tasks performed by different teams (Uppenberg and Strauss, 2010). This diversity of tasks performed is of importance because we can expect systematic differences in the age composition between different types of teams. Though the majority of jobs in this sector are not physically demanding, technological change and new or changing work tasks may pose related challenges to older employees, resulting in reduced productivity.====The sequel of the paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the work environment and the various tasks in a typical financial company. Section III discusses our data, and section IV discusses our productivity measure, whereas section V introduces our econometric identification strategy. Section VI presents our main results, and section VII presents analyses on employee fluctuation, retirement, and other censoring events.

In contrast to the often generous schemes considered before, this study investigates the effects of a non-contributory pension scheme in Thailand that grants much smaller benefits. Our empirical analysis exploits a reform which expanded the scheme from a targeted program to universal coverage. Using a generalized difference-in-difference model, we provide evidence that gaining eligibility for the scheme can affect work status and literacy of children living with eligible ====, while not actually raising total net household income. The effect sizes we find for older children in our sample are within the range of those estimated from more generous schemes. Younger children do not benefit from the reform.","Intensive reforming over the last decades resulted in major progress toward universal primary and lower secondary enrollment in Thailand. Yet, several consecutive PISA studies alarmingly find that a third of the Thai students are functionally illiterate at the age of 15 (Lathapipat, 2013, Lathapipat, 2018). The problem tends to be larger in the poorer rural areas, where students have less access to educational resources and qualified teachers are difficult to recruit (Lounkaew, 2013). Moreover, children in poor households face additional constraints to education: they may have to divide their focus between school and work tasks, i.e. have to spend part of their time to assist in family owned (farm-) businesses or otherwise contribute to the household income (Nicaise et al., 2000, Lathapipat, 2013). An increasing literature on conditional and unconditional cash transfers shows that cash influx can help to relief such constraints to education (Kabeer and Piza, 2012). In particular, various indirect benefits on schooling and work status have been perceived for children in pension-eligible households in South Africa, Brazil and Mexico (Edmonds, 2006, Ponczek, 2011, Carvalho Filho, 2012, Gutierrez et al., 2017).====In this study, we investigate the effects of a two-staged reform of the Thai social pension on child outcomes in Northeast Thailand. The first stage of the reform (in 2009) transformed an existing targeted pension scheme into a scheme with universal coverage. The reform introduced a monthly payment of 500 Baht (==== $US 15) – equal to two to three days of median daily minimum wage – for all elderly aged 60 and above. The second stage of the reform (in 2011) increased the basic amount from 500 to 600 Baht (==== $US 18) at entry age 60 and up to 1000 Baht (==== $US 30) based on beneficiary age. As very poor households were eligible for pension payments also before the reform and not all eligible households registered for pension, the factual increase in average household pension income in our sample ranges from approximately 230 Baht per month (after the first reform) to approximately 460 Baht per month (after the second reform).====We conduct a generalized difference-in-difference analysis investigating the effects of the reform on school enrollment, children’s work status, and literacy. In contrast to most previous studies, we use panel data in our analyses, which enables us to control for household-level unobserved heterogeneity. Specifically, we compare the within-changes of education-related outcomes for children in eligible households before and after the reform to the within-changes of a control group of children in similar but non-eligible households. As we find that pension payments do not significantly increase net total household income, we focus on interpreting the effects of pension eligibility instead of the level of transfers received. However, to account for possible selection issues due to non-universal pension take-up, we additionally implement an instrumental variable strategy, i.e. we use pension eligibility to instrument for pension receipt, as validated in Duflo (2003). In all specifications, we restrict our sample to three-generation households. Thus, we ensure that children in the control group live with at least one member who (soon) qualifies for pension. Our treatment group also includes children living with elderly eligible for pension payments before the 2009 reform. We cannot distinguish these children from those living in post-reform eligible households because pre-reform eligibility criteria are too imprecise to identify them. Provided that the effects of pension on children in pre-reform eligible households have already occurred before 2009, the effect sizes we estimate could be regarded as conservative.====Our main findings are threefold. First, we do ==== find conclusive statistically significant evidence that pension eligibility positively affects enrolment of children or adolescents at the aggregated level and when dis-aggregating the estimates by age, gender of child, and gender of pension recipient. However, for certain groups of children this may reflect a lack of statistical power and not a lack of economic relevance. There is some indication that the pension reform might have contributed positively to the probability of enrollment among the older cohort, particularly for boys. ITT-estimates for older boys range from (statistically insignificant) 6 to 12 percentage point increases in enrollment (from a baseline enrollment rate of 77 percent), depending on the gender of the pension recipient, and seem generally larger than those of girls ranging from −7 to 8 percentage points (insignificant; baseline enrollment rate of 85 percent). However, we also find relatively large (yet, insignificant) negative coefficients for the younger cohort, particularly for boys (ranging from −9 to −12 percentage points), suggesting a reallocation of resources within the household. In a robustness test we look at an alternative outcome for educational attainment – whether the household head indicates that a child’s ==== occupation is student. While the effect estimates obtained from the ITT-specification are close to zero for the younger cohort and positive but statically insignificant for the older cohort, the LATE estimates indicate a significant (at the 10% level) increase in student status as main occupation for the older cohort.====Second, looking at children’s work status, we examine whether children were less distracted from school as a result of the pension. We find a statistically significant 8 percentage point decrease in the likelihood to work for older children (baseline rate: 17 percent), while the younger cohort is not significantly affected (due to low incidents of work at baseline). The effect on older children seems particularly driven by a reduction in informal (agricultural) work for girls and reduced engagement in formal non-agricultural work for boys. 6.====Finally, we examine whether these changes in time use translate into improved learning outcomes. We find that some girls in the older cohort have benefited from pension with respect to literacy, measured as a binary variable reported by the household-head. Depending on recipient gender, estimates range from a 4 to a 7 percentage point increase (only the latter significant at the 10% level).==== We do not detect such effects for older boys.====It is not clear, per se, that reducing labor supply (to increase education outcomes) of older teenagers is a worthy goal if the overall aim is to maximize/stabilize future income streams at the household or individual level. This would require that schooling decisions are distorted, for instance, by market failure (e.g. credit constraints) in absence of the pension. Although we cannot conclusively test for such distortions in our sample, existing studies indicate that educational attainment might be sub-optimal in the region. Nicaise et al. (2000) provide qualitative evidence that financial restrictions to education might play a role in poorer areas of Thailand. Karaivanov (2012) finds that the region is generally credit constraint and more so than the rest of the country. Tangtipongkul (2015) documents that private and social returns-to-education in Thailand peek at the Bachelor level – an attainment level which almost none of the children in our sample reach. Wongmonta and Glewwe (2017) show that returns to education are not only high in urban but also (albeit somewhat lower) in rural areas of Thailand. Furthermore, there is little doubt that additional rudimentary skills such as literacy should improve labor market prospects and, consequently, future income streams. We therefore conclude that the additional learning that pension brings is beneficial for (at least some of) the children in our sample, and perhaps the elderly in their households – if children pass on their educational returns when becoming adults.====Pension has the potential to change education outcomes through at least two channels. First, the positive income shock can ease credit constraints to education for the household as a whole or for individual household members (Edmonds, 2006, Ponczek, 2011).==== While households in Northeast Thailand are generally poor, pension payments before 2009 were restricted to few very poor elderly only.==== Newly eligible beneficiaries in our study area are, hence, mostly poor but not extremely so. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that their most basic needs were already met before the reform, which allows them to spend their pension income in goods or services not directly related to bare survival. Given that in the Thai context, children (especially girls) are expected to (financially) look after parents and grandparents in old age (Wongmonta and Glewwe, 2017), it is a reasonable hypothesis that older household members have an incentive to invest in their grandchildren’s education, provided the return on additional training pays off. However, we demonstrate that pension income does not translate into greater spending on education at the household level overall. Coefficients are close to zero and insignificant. Yet, across all of our findings, we detect suggestive evidence of age-differentiated patterns of how pension affects child outcomes. The patterns we find are consistent with the interpretation that a reallocation of resources from the younger to older children in pension households might be at play. If pension eligibility induced a sudden awareness of aging, such a reallocation would be plausible as older children are closer to reach labor market maturity to harvest educational returns. Our study lacks statistical power to fully explore these patterns, though. Moreover, our expenditure data are only at the household level, prohibiting us to explore any intra-household reallocation of resources clearly. We therefore leave the research of this mechanism open to future studies.====Second, pension eligibility can facilitate changes in labor allocation. Studies show that pension allows elderly household members to retire earlier from their main occupation (e.g. discussed by Carvalho, 2008, Kaushal, 2014, Juárez and Pfutze, 2015, Galiani et al., 2016). Yokying and Floro (2020) document that the labor supply of Thai children is positively correlated to the work activities of adults in the household. For instance, children help with tasks in the family business or (girls) take over household chores to enable adult household members to work. Consequentially, retirement decisions of elderly might decrease the likelihood of child work. However, binary labor supply responses of the eligible are statistically and economically insignificant in our sample. Yet, we provide evidence that total household income does not rise as a result of pension eligibility, while we document that pension payments were indeed received. This suggests that eligible elderly use pension payments to replace previous sources of income. We cannot exclude that a reduction of elderly labor supply happens along the intensive margin.====Our findings add to the literature in two distinct ways. First, our findings show that already relatively small pension payments might have a relatively large impacts on child outcomes (it remains questionable whether these effects are beneficial to all children, though, as discussed above). Compared to other pension programs studied in developing countries the Thai pension benefits are rather small (PPP$ 20–40, based on 2009 PPP conversion rate). The factual average additional pension income received by the average household we study corresponds (only) to roughly 60 to 70 percent of the average monthly education expenses per enrolled child spent by the households in our sample. Yet, the effect sizes we detect fall within a similar range compared to previous studies on more generous programs: For example, the intensely studied South African social pension system guarantees benefits that correspond to up to about half of the average South African household income (Case and Deaton, 1998). The maximum benefit amounts to 370 Rand (or ==== PPP$ 135 as of 1993) per eligible====. Edmonds (2006) investigates the effects of the scheme and finds schooling rates increased by 12 (teenage boys) to 14 (teenage girls) percentage points and a reduction in work status for girls of 7 percentage points in both-gender eligible households. Further, a social pension in Brazil grants generous benefits equal to the size of monthly minimum wage: average benefits received in rural areas in 1991 were 121 Brazilian Real (or ==== PPP$ 144 as of the 1995 PPP conversion rate)====. Ponczek, 2011, Carvalho Filho, 2012 analyze the impact of the scheme and show that school attendance of girls increases if they live with beneficiaries of the reform, ranging from 2 (for every $R100 in Carvalho Filho (2012)) to 7 percentage points====. Ponczek (2011) further investigates literacy and finds that co-residing with male eligible improves girls’ literacy by 7 percentage points. Finally, a pension scheme in Mexico City guarantees transfers of $US 60 which correspond to about 30 % of average income of eligible individuals====. Gutierrez et al. (2017) studies the effect of eligibility for the scheme on enrollment rates and work status in a regression discontinuity set-up. Their graphical analysis suggests an increase in enrollment and decrease in work status of teenagers by roughly 10 percentage points, respectively, at the pension-cut-off. The coefficients we compute in the present study fall into a similar range compared to previous studies, despite that the Thai pension payments are substantially lower. More generally, our study confirms that the size of the pension payment is not necessarily indicative of the size of the effect on child outcomes. This has been shown before by Li and Mora (2016) who estimate that a pension scheme in Nepal resulted in increased infant survival of 7–8 percentage points from a baseline of 89%. The pension payment received was only 100 Nepal Rupees (or ==== PPP$ 7.5 as of 1994) per month.====Second, and from a broader perspective, our study speaks to the literature that examines gender norms and disparities in the treatment of children in developing countries. Girls in Thailand are generally more expected than boys to (financially) care for their parents and grandparents in old age. In contrast to many other developing countries where an imbalance in educational investments typically leans towards preferring boys over girls, in Thailand girls are supported in their education just as much as boys (or even more). However, adverse social norms surrounding labor supply and compensation of female work strongly persist in Thailand. Despite better educational outcomes for girls (Lounkaew, 2013), women in Thailand earn less, participate less in the labor force and are more involved in unpaid work (Adireksombat et al., 2015, Fang and Sakellariou, 2011, Tangtipongkul, 2015, Thailand National Statistical Office, 2011). Within this nexus, a reduction in informal agricultural work of adolescent girls may be seen as a value in itself. Sociologists argue that the formation of gender norms is particularly intensified during adolescence (Hill, 1983). Reducing the participation of teenage girls in informal (and likely unpaid) work may contribute to forming more balanced gender norms around the labor market and reinforce more gender-balanced labor market outcomes later in their lives.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief overview of the history and characteristics of the social pension scheme in Thailand. We describe our data and empirical strategy in Section 3 and Section 4 respectively. Results are presented in Section 5.2 with additional robustness analyses in Section 6.

I exploit two Austrian pension reforms increasing the early retirement age step-wise for different quarter-of-birth cohorts. Empirical results based on Austrian administrative data reveal a substantial ,"A lot of societies face a demographic transition to an increasing share of older people in the population. This particularly challenges the financial sustainability of public pension systems. As a response, governments react with policies and reforms to raise the participation in the labor market of elderly workers. Such policy changes focus on offering financial incentives for longer employment or raising the eligibility age of (early) retirement. These policies, however, primarily affect a rather vulnerable group of workers with less promising labor market perspectives; the labor market participation rate of workers above 55 among OECD countries is only 73% for men as compared to 90.1% of prime-age workers in 2018. This paper uses data from Austria, where the labor participation rate of elderly workers of 63.5% is substantially below OECD average and these workers are particularly affected by long-term unemployment.====The re-integration of unemployed elderly workers is challenging. Ichino et al. (2017) report that elderly workers also face a higher probability of a transition to early retirement in particular when they are unemployed. In this context, it is important to study and understand how raises in the (early) retirement age affect these workers. Theoretically, there are two obvious channels through which such a policy reform could affect employment prospects of elderly unemployed workers. First, Hairault et al. (2010) argue that the probability of older workers’ employment is affected by the distance to retirement. A raise in the eligibility age of early retirement extends the expected time to retirement and could therefore support the re-integration of unemployed workers. Second, retirement reforms may increase the returns to (on-the-job) training for elderly workers. Standard neo-classical human capital theory would predict that later early retirement should have positive effects on human capital formation because the period in which benefits from human capital investments may materialize, is longer (Becker, 1975). Less surprisingly, training of older workers is often promoted as a policy to keep older workers employed or bring them out of unemployment (Mayhew and Rijkers, 2004).====This paper directly connects to these two channels. I study how raising the eligibility age of early retirement affects unemployment duration, the re-integration on the labor market and the participation in active labor market policies (ALMP) as a potential mechanism. I exploit a natural experiment in the Austrian pension system as an exogenous variation in early retirement age. In two pension reforms, the eligibility age of early retirement was increased stepwise for different quarter-of-birth cohorts from 60 to 65 for men and 55 to 60 for women. I use comprehensive social security data and detailed data on active labor market policy participation of unemployed people in Austria between 2000 and 2013. Based on a sample of unemployed workers due to plant closures and mass layoffs I find a significant gender gap in how workers are affected by a raise in the early retirement age. While unemployment duration is unaffected for men and lower for women, men benefit from an enforced later retirement in terms of larger re-employment probabilities and better subsequent job quality (measured by days in employment and labor income after unemployment) as compared to women. In terms of participation in active labor market policies (ALMP), men are more likely to be assigned to training programs, which primarily focus on improving job search/application skills rather than job qualification trainings. The latter effect is, however, not homogenous for all workers. There are no such effects observable for women.====This paper contributes to several strands in the literature. First, it relates to the extensive economic literature on the labor market effects of pension reforms. These studies find – consistently across countries and nature of pension reforms – positive employment effects as a response to retirement policies which restrict access to (early) retirement or reduce financial incentives for earlier retirement.====Second, the paper contributes to the literature on unemployment, job displacement and retirement decisions. Ichino et al., 2017, Hairault et al., 2010 or Marmora and Ritter (2015) document that unemployment of elderly workers affects retirement timing and re-employment probabilities. Using the Regional Extended Benefits Program in Austria, Inderbitzin et al. (2016) show that extending unemployment insurance for older workers generates a substantial increase in the incidence of early retirement. Tatsiramos (2010) shows that in countries with more generous unemployment insurance provisions for older unemployed workers including a pathway to early retirement, displaced older workers have lower re-employment and higher retirement rates.====Finally, the paper also supplements the strand of literature about training and older workers’ employment. To avoid skill obsolescence of older workers, investment in training is recognised as an important element to the benefit of workers and employers (Picchio, 2015). Particularly the ongoing fast technological progress prevalent in many sectors makes training of the older workforce a useful policy. Existing studies focus on employed workers and on-the-job training, which is typically (partly) funded by employers, and find positive effects on older workers’ employment (e.g. Belloni et al., 2015, Picchio and van Ours, 2013, Berg et al., 2017).==== Only a few papers study the relationship between (early) retirement institutions and on-the-job training of employed workers: Fouarge and Schils (2009) show that generous early retirement schemes discourage older workers from taking part in training, while more flexible schemes encourage. Brunello and Comi (2015) show that an increase in the minimum retirement age in Italy substantially increased training participation by private sector employees aged 40–54. Montizaan et al. (2010) exploit a Dutch pension reform reducing pension rights and find significant increases in training course participation among older employees in large organizations. However, there is no study so far looking at re-training of unemployed workers and – closely related – for publicly funded training programs.====The contribution of this paper is therefore twofold: it is the first paper to study the effect of a pension reform on unemployed elderly workers, and shows how raising the eligibility age of early retirement affects the re-integration of these workers in terms of employment and job quality. Second, this paper also considers a potential mechanism for re-integration into the labor market and provides first evidence on whether public labor market institutions react to pension reforms and adapt their policies to improve skill set of workers and re-employ elderly workers. Thus the paper also complements the literature on on-the-job training by studying training participation of unemployed workers in publicly funded training programs.====The paper is organized as follows: Section ‘Institutional background’ provides an overview of the institutional background in Austria and describes the pension reforms implemented in Austria.

The literature so far has, however, mostly neglected the post-transition countries. The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidence on various labour market implications of informal care in the three Baltic States – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In particular, we examine the extensive and intensive margins of work, wage effects, job seeking behaviour and utilization of unemployment benefits. We apply ==== approach to address the observed endogeneity of informal care. The obtained results support the existence of a significant deterrent effect of caregiving on both extensive and intensive margins of work among males and females in all the three countries. Wage penalties are found to be stronger in Estonia and Latvia, where reliance on familial care is particularly high. The evidence also suggests that the existing systems induce excessive utilization of unemployment benefits among males in the three Baltic States. The results provided in this study are germane to the development of national labour market and long-term care policies.","Population ageing implies important socio-economic challenges for all European countries. The pressure on long-term care (LTC) systems and public budgets is increasing gradually, and this trend is expected to continue during the following decades. The situation is particularly unfavourable in the three Baltic States – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, where particularly poor demographic indicators in line with strongly limited fiscal resources necessitate designing efficient socio-economic policies in order to tackle the emerging implications and create sustainable systems.====Lithuania stands out in the European Union with regard to the rapid ageing of its population: according to the estimates by the EC (European Commission, 2018), within a decade Lithuania will face the highest old-age dependency ratio in the EU at 46,4% (in 2030). In Latvia this indicator is expected to be the 4th highest in the EU at 43.5%. The situation is compounded by low fertility and the ongoing mass emigration of relatively young people in Latvia and Lithuania: since the EU accession (2004), the size of the working-age population in Latvia and Lithuania has shrunk by 20.1% and 20.0% accordingly, which are the two highest indicators in the EU (Eurostat 2019  year data).====Although emigration indicators were less dramatic in Estonia, this country, similar to Latvia (Xenogiani et al., 2019), faces the problem of increasing official disability rates (Ministry of Social Affairs of the Republic of Estonia data). Latvia and Estonia are among just four EU countries where more than a quarter of the population aged 65 + consistently report long-standing severe limitations in usual activities due to health problems (Eurostat data====). This is well above the EU average of 16.3% (as of 2018).====These negative tendencies in the context of strictly constrained state budget resources and low public LTC spending in all the three Baltic States (OECD, 2018) are already found to raise the demand for care within families and pose growing pressure on informal caregivers. While the majority of adult children providing care to their frail parents are still in their working years, informal caregiving may negatively affect their work behaviour. At the same time, given that younger entrants to the labour market diminish, allowing informal carers to remain in the labour force and contribute to the economy becomes increasingly important.====Caregiving may affect work behaviour on both the extensive and intensive margin. Changes in the extensive margin are related to quitting employment temporarily or permanently, e.g. retiring early (Van Houtven et al., 2013), while changes in the intensive margin are related to reducing work hours and taking on fewer responsibilities at work (Carmichael and Charles, 2003; Heger and Korfhage, 2017). Both margins have potential implications for current and future labour income, further labour market prospects, retirement benefits, thus affecting quality of life not only during caring period, but through the entire remaining lifespan.====This paper studies labour market implications of informal caregiving in the post-transition context using EU-SILC 2016 year data for the three Baltic States. We explore the effect of informal caregiving on a set of labour market outcomes: we analyse both the extensive and intensive margins of work and estimate labour income effects. Furthermore, we look beyond the traditional labour outcomes examined in the literature and consider such indicators as looking for a job and being on unemployment benefits. We analyse the ‘average’ caregiver, as well as consider the phenomenon of a main caregiver in the household. Our analysis is based on the nationally representative samples of Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian men and women aged 18–74. Given that in Baltic States, similar to many other European countries, women are disproportionately burdened by informal care, we will consider the effects of caregiving separately for males and females.====The effect of informal caregiving on labour market outcomes is an empirical question. The direction and the size of the effects may depend on a number of country-specific factors, such as the overall economic situation, various characteristics of labour markets, legislative framework protecting the rights of informal carers, coverage and eligibility criteria for publicly-provided home care services as a direct substitute of informal care, public support for the disabled and caregivers (e.g. generosity of disability-related benefits and caregiver allowances), etc. Such contextual distinctions are enhanced by diverse cultural factors and demographic situations, implying that the effect of informal care on labour market outcomes is expected to vary substantially across European landscape.====Most previous studies have found evidence on a negative relationship between informal caregiving and employment (Bolin et al., 2008, Carmichael and Charles, 2003; Casado-Marín et al., 2011; Ciccarelli and Van Soest, 2018; Crespo and Mira, 2010; Ettner, 1995; Fevang et al., 2008; Heitmueller, 2007; Pavalko and Artis, 1997, Unger, 2013 among others). In contrast, Van Houtven et al. (2013) indicated no significant effect on the probability of working for men or women, while Schmitz and Westphal (2017) proposed that only long-lasting intensive care provision has sizeable negative effect on the employment.====There seems to be even less consensus in conclusions related to the effect of caregiving on work hours and wage penalties among the employed. Johnson and LoSasso (2000) found that both male and female caregivers in the US are forced to reduce their work hours and face wage penalties. In turn Wolf and Soldo (1994) provided no evidence of reduced conditional hours of work due to the provision of parental care among women in US.==== ====Two decades later Van Houtven et al. (2013) concluded that in US any type of informal care has a negative and significant effect on hours worked for employed women, and chore care has a negative effect on their wages, however little effect is found on employed men’s hours or wages. Carmichael and Charles (2003) provided evidence on negative effects of informal care on hours of work and wages for both male and female workers in UK. Analysing nearly full sample of countries available in the first wave of The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, Bolin et al. (2008) haven’t found statistically significant effects of informal care provision on wages or work hours for males and females (when analysing them separately); however, the analysis of north–south gradient proposed sizeable differences between European regions. This is consistent with findings by Spiess and Schneider (2003) who propose that the impact of caregiving on weekly work hours differs a lot in southern and northern Europe.====The lack of consensus in the literature stems not only from the differences in country-specific labour market contexts, legislative frameworks, LTC systems etc., but also from a number of study-specific characteristics, e.g. differences in time periods analysed, data types (longitudinal vs cross-sectional) and samples used, controlling or not for endogeneity of informal care variables, the choice of instruments and, importantly, substantial differences in the analysed informal care indicators. This makes it impossible to compare directly the situations in different countries if they are not analysed within one study, or to generalize the obtained results to countries with dissimilar backgrounds.====In our paper we contribute to the literature multifold. First, this is the first paper that provides comprehensive analysis of labour market effects of informal care in the post-transition context. Although the literature exploring the relationship between caregiving and work in Europe is quite extensive, it covers a limited set of countries, mostly the richest ones, therefore leaving it an open question as to how informal care affects labour market outcomes in the other countries, including the Baltic States.====Second, we extend the literature analysing the effect of caregiving on willingness to work. While many papers look at the impact of informal care obligations on employment and hours of work, such analysis allows concluding on the actual ability to enter or remain in employment, but not the willingness and readiness to participate. Even when income effect of informal caregiving exceeds the substitution effect==== (see Carmichael and Charles, 1998), which is more likely to happen in countries with less favourable economic situation and low public support to informal carers and disabled, the increasing caregivers’ willingness to work may not always translate into higher employment rate due to the rigidity of labour market (e.g. lack of job offers with flexible working hours and part-time jobs that would allow combining work and care responsibilities) and absence of regulations and settings supporting informal carers (e.g. poor coverage with publicly-provided home care services, unavailability of care leaves and respite care). Hence, the effect of caregiving on willingness to work and actual employment may not always be the same in its magnitude and even direction. This implies that concluding on willingness to participate and the relative strength of the income and substitution effects is not possible when the analysis is limited to such indicators as employment and working hours. In this paper, to understand whether informal caregiving induces greater labour market activity we analyse the probability of being a job seeker within the working age nonemployed subsample. Thus, considering the extensive margin of work, we are able to conclude on the carers’ ability to be (remain) in employment compared to their counterparts without care obligations conditional on labour force participation. Then, analysing the probability of being a job seeker among those without work allows finding out whether caregiving increases or reduces the motivation to look for a job in case of nonemployment.====One may claim that many authors analyse labour force participation thus covering the issue of willingness to work (e.g. Casado-Marín et al., 2011, Meng, 2013, Nguyen and Connelly, 2014; Van Houtven et al., 2013); however, all of these authors although referring to labour force participation actually analyse the employment indicator, whereas, according to the definition, labour force indicator includes not only employed, but also unemployed who are seeking work and available for work (International Labour Organization definition). According to our best knowledge, none of the previous papers actually attempted to analyse labour force participation or unemployment indicator to understand how informal caregiving affects willingness to work, not only employment as such.====Third, we look beyond the traditional labour outcomes examined in the literature and analyse the effect of informal care obligations on being on unemployment insurance benefits. While in 2016 the maximum unemployment benefit spell was short in the Baltic States (at only 9 months in Latvia and Lithuania and up to 12 months==== in Estonia) and was subject to previous contribution history, the probability of being on unemployment benefit at a certain point of time was relatively low. Hence, if the positive effect of informal caregiving is found this most likely proposes that carers are inclined to temporarily quit employment and use unemployment benefit spells as ‘paid care leaves’.====While the analysis of labour market implications of informal caregiving has been lacking in the three Baltic country studies, this paper provides new important information that will be helpful for designing sustainable LTC and labour market policies in the context of rapid population ageing and growing demand for care. We find strong evidence on the negative effect of caregiving on both extensive and intensive margins of work in the three countries analysed. The results also signal on the wage penalties related to informal care provision. We find that caregiving is associated with greater willingness to work among non-employed Latvians and Estonian females, but not males. This implies that among less well financially protected Latvians and the Estonian females experiencing huge gender pay gap the income effect of caregiving exceeds the substitution effect. The results propose that the existing LTC systems in all the three Baltic States induce excessive utilization of unemployment benefits – in the absence of the sufficient support informal male carers tend to use unemployment benefit spells as a specific form of paid care leaves.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some insights into the peculiarities of the national long-term care systems and public support for informal caregivers available in the three Baltic States. Section 3 provides details about the data, outcome measures and control variables. Section 4 discusses the endogeneity problem and presents the empirical strategy used in this paper. Section 5 discusses the empirical results, while Section 6 concludes. The descriptive statistics are presented in the Appendix.",Informal caregiving and work: A high price to pay.

The mechanism underlying this relationship is less well-known. I provide evidence on this question using data from the introduction of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), a new medical technology with substantial health benefits in high HIV prevalence settings. I find limited support for several leading potential mechanisms such as previous investment in older substitute technologies, cohort differences in educational attainment, or various life-cycle changes (i.e. marriage, having ever had sex, coital frequency). I provide a model demonstrating that shorter time horizons and lower consumption values of life mechanically associated with ageing may cause lower VMMC adoption among older males and simulate the adoption-age profile under various parameter assumptions. I discuss implications for policymaking and future research.","A popular conception is that older people are less likely to adopt new technologies than are younger people. For example, the New York Times, the Pew Research Center, and the AARP all have recent commentary on the hypothesis that older people are less likely to adopt internet technology (Anderson, 2016, Gustke, 2016, Anderson and Perrin, 2017). This perspective is not new, with historical references dating back to at least 1721 (Bailey, 1917) and includes a wide range of technologies such as automobiles, telephones, the worldwide web. Yet the mechanism underlying this relationship is less well-known. Why is ageing associated with lower adoption of new technologies?====I provide evidence on this question using data from a new medical technology with substantial health benefits, far from universal take-up, and lower take-up among older people. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) reduces female-to-male HIV transmission by approximately 50–75% (Auvert et al., 2005, Bailey et al., 2007, Gray et al., 2007). Projections suggest that achieving 80% coverage among males age 15–49 in 14 priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa may help avert 3.4 million HIV infections and generate US$16.5 billion in net savings due to averted treatment and care costs (WHO, 2012).==== As of 2016, only 14.5 million (WHO, 2017) of the target number of 27 million VMMCs in Eastern and Southern Africa had been performed (UNAIDS, 2015). Coverage among age 30 and above has lagged behind VMMC coverage at younger ages (Plotkin et al., 2013, Hankins et al., 2016, Grund et al., 2018), yet promoting take-up in this older population is required to achieve the greatest reduction in HIV incidence (Thirumurthy et al., 2016).====The literature on the microeconomics of household (or individual) technology adoption largely has focused on adoption determinants other than age (see Foster and Rosenzweig (2010) for a review), yet economic intuition yields several key insights about potential mechanisms. As individuals age they may be less likely to adopt new technologies for several key reasons. First, older individuals have shorter time horizons over which to accrue benefits from investing in new technologies. Second, older individuals may have invested in earlier technologies that are substitutes for new technologies. Third, other cohort differences, particularly in educational attainment, may affect the likelihood of adoption and in turn affect the cross-sectional adoption-age profile. Fourth, other life-cycle changes (e.g., in the case of VMMC, marriage, having ever had sex, coital frequency) could underlie low technology adoption.====Previous investment in older technologies may be particularly important in settings where the technology is long-lasting, or even irreversible as in the case of traditional circumcision and VMMC. Although the time horizon hypothesis may seem appealing, the ability of this mechanism to generate declining adoption-age profiles may be sensitive to assumptions about the individual discount factor. In the case of VMMC, all of the aforementioned hypotheses appear plausible. Understanding why VMMC adoption declines with age will yield behavioral insights for policymakers to increase VMMC take-up among this critical, older group (Thirumurthy et al., 2016). More broadly, it will help researchers understand the empirical relevance of mechanisms possibly underlying low technology adoption among older people in other settings. Despite its plausibility, there appears to be little economic evidence on the role of time horizons in explaining declining technology adoption with age.====I examine health technology adoption decisions from over 14,000 males ages 15–59 in Zambia. Starting in 2008, Zambia began performing VMMCs as part of the World Health Organization (WHO) mass VMMC campaign for HIV prevention. By 2014, nearly 1 million VMMCs had been performed, equivalent to approximately 11% of the male population. The Zambia 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) includes information from male respondents on circumcision status, age at circumcision, place of circumcision (e.g., health facility, home), who performed the circumcision (e.g., health provider, traditional healer), and reason for circumcision (e.g., disease prevention, disease treatment, traditional). I use this information to provide large-scale evidence on who adopts VMMC and to unpack the mechanisms linking age to adoption. Although at first glance VMMC may seem to be an unusual setting, the circumcision adoption decision is a part of everyday life in Zambia and, as I discuss later in the analysis, the immediate benefits of VMMC are not confined to a particular demographic group (e.g., young individuals or unmarried individuals).====I find limited support for several leading potential mechanisms such as previous older substitute technologies, cohort differences in educational attainment, various life-cycle changes (e.g., marriage, having ever had sex, coital frequency), or other factors hypothesized to affect adoption that may vary across cohorts or across the life-cycle (e.g., HIV status and knowledge about HIV prevention methods). These results are robust to including additional controls and to restricting the regression samples to males outside of the age range targeted in VMMC campaigns, suggesting that supply-side factors do not fully explain the adoption-age gradient.====I provide a model demonstrating that shorter time horizons and lower consumption values of life mechanically associated with ageing may cause lower VMMC adoption among older people. I use this model to simulate adoption-age profiles and find that the model readily generates the observed adoption age profile. Ideally, it would be possible to exploit quasi-experimental variation in life expectancy to further that it is age causing the decrease and test this mechanism. In lieu of such variation, I rely on the structural model, simulations, controlling for a variety of individual/household/geographic factors, and ruling out alternative mechanisms. I review the limitations of this strategy in the Discussion section.====A key insight from the structural model is that limited time horizons inhibit individual investments in new health technologies. Simulation result indicate that one policy commonly used to improve health behaviors and outcomes – unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) – is unlikely to substantially increase take-up unless the income transfers are substantial in magnitude. Instead, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) targeted toward older males or interventions designed to reframe the adoption decision away from a cost-benefit decision and toward a conceptual framework that does not emphasize shorter time horizons may be required. I conclude by discussing this insight and several additional implications for policymaking and future research.====These findings contribute to several bodies of literature. First, I expand the literature on the microeconomics of technology adoption (e.g., Bandiera and Rasul, 2006, Giné and Yang, 2009, Conley and Udry, 2010, Duflo et al., 2011, Adhvaryu, 2014, Tarozzi et al., 2014, Bensch and Peters, 2015, Carter et al., 2016; see Foster and Rosenzweig, 2010 for a review) by examining the role of age, a factor that this literature appears not to have examined. Second, I expand the economics literature on time horizons and VMMC (Wilson et al., 2014) by demonstrating that time horizons may affect adoption. Third, I add to the broader economic literature on circumcision, which includes studies of how to increase VMMC take-up (Thirumurthy et al., 2014, Thirumurthy et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2015, Wilson et al., 2016, Friedman and Wilson, 2016), how beliefs and information about circumcision affects risky sexual behavior (including a test of risk compensation) (Wilson et al., 2014, Godlonton et al., 2016), and how circumcision affects marriage markets (Wilson and Janicki, 2016).====The rest of the analysis is organized as follows. Section “Context” describes the study context. Section “Data and Statistical Methods” discusses the data and statistical methods. Section “Regression Results” presents the regression results. Section “Model and Simulations” provides a structural model, simulates the adoption decision, examines several additional predictions of the structural model, and simulates alternative policy scenarios.

This type of living arrangement lowers the dietary quality and eating frequency of their meals, leading to unhealthy diets. Further estimation finds evidence that household size and composition have significant effects on elders’ eating behaviors, namely, scale and ====, explaining the differential eating behaviors of elders among different patterns of living arrangements.","The population in China is rapidly aging due to the long-term effect of the one-child policy and the increasing average life expectancy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the population aged 60 and over in China reached 249 million by the end of 2018, accounting for 18% of the population. This elderly population is expected to increase to approximately 255 million by 2020, when the dependency ratio will increase to 28%.==== At the same time, the traditional living arrangements of the elderly are continuously changing in that Chinese elderly are increasingly living alone or only with his/her spouse (Zeng and Wang, 2003, Lei et al., 2015). Traditionally, family is the main source of support for the elderly, especially in rural areas, where elderly people receive physical support and financial support through living with their offspring (Korinek et al., 2011, Lei et al., 2015). The rapidly aging population and increased number of older adults living alone in rural areas have raised concerns that such cohorts are more vulnerable to unhealthy dietary behaviors and poor health outcomes.====Dietary intake and nutrition of the elderly are closely related to their health outcomes; good eating habits accompanied by a balanced diet have important effects on maintaining an individual’s physiological health and avoiding long-term diseases (Chen et al., 2001, Milte et al., 2015). Specifically, the association between diets and various health outcomes, including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all-cause mortality, have been examined in previous literature (Ford et al., 2014, Harmon et al., 2015, Sotos-Prieto et al., 2015, Solbak et al., 2017). The profound effects of diet and nutrition have been emphasized in numerous studies (Tian and Yu, 2015) and the eating behaviors of the elderly is one of the key considerations for healthy aging in China.====Emerging publications have generally found improved health statuses for individuals who live with others than those who live alone (Michael et al., 2001, Walter-Ginzburg et al., 2002, Chen and Short, 2008, Sun et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2014). Although the literature appears to suggest that living arrangements influence diet (Locher et al., 2005, Quine and Morrell, 2007, Bae et al., 2007), the interactions between living arrangements and an individual’s dietary intake remain unknown. Typically, understanding these interactions will help in understanding the full-scale effect of offspring migration on left-behind elders during China’s agricultural transformation.====This study contributes to the literature in investigating the mechanism of elders’ living arrangements affecting their eating behaviors by identifying scale effects and spillover effects. The study is built on a novel dataset from a four-wave survey (2004–2011) of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), and we use a fixed effects model to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity. Given that propensity score matching (PSM) mimics randomization by creating two groups that are comparable on observed covariates (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983), we implemented the PSM method to examine the robustness of the results.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Most research on the extension of working lives has examined what determines whether older people remain attached to the labor market, neglecting the diversity of their labor force statuses. Also, what we know from this line of inquiry is derived almost exclusively from developed countries, leaving other regions, such as Latin America, unexplored. Based on a life-course approach, we close these research gaps by analyzing how types of lifetime employment and coresidential trajectories determine both the extension of working lives beyond FPA and the diverse labor force statuses of older workers in Chile. We draw on a rich and comprehensive life history dataset of a cohort of Chileans currently aged 65–75 and use longitudinal and cross-sectional statistical methods. Our results indicate that individuals who followed diverse employment trajectories throughout their lives (whether in formal or informal jobs) but permanently coresided with a partner and adult children were most likely to be partly retired in old age (i.e., working while receiving a pension). Those who followed more informal employment trajectories while living permanently with a partner were more likely to remain active, particularly through self-employment, beyond FPA. We stress the importance for future labor policies aimed at older populations to consider the diversity of life-course trajectories in the employment and family domains.","Over the last two decades, the proportion of people remaining active in the labor market beyond full pension age (FPA)—the age at which one qualifies for a full pension—has increased considerably both in countries with traditionally generous social protection and in countries with less generous social security (Kuhn et al., 2018). For instance, within the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the labor force participation rate of people aged 65+ grew from 9.1% to 15.3% between 2000 and 2018 (OECD, 2020a). Compared to previous cohorts, increasing survival rates and better health within this age group have allowed individuals to work longer (French and Jones, 2017; Nicholas et al., 2018). Governments around the world, following suggestions made by international organizations, have introduced policy reforms to encourage older people to delay their transition to retirement and extend their working lives by closing early retirement channels and introducing financial incentives for later labor market exits (Böckerman and Ilmakunnas, 2019, Ní Léime et al., 2020).====While social scientists have criticized extended working life policies because they overlook social inequality by forcing people with social and health disadvantages to continue working longer (see, e.g., Lain et al., 2020, Lain and Phillipson, 2019, Loretto and Vickerstaff, 2015, Madero-Cabib and Kaeser, 2016, Phillipson, 2019), such policies have significantly increased the number of active older workers worldwide (see Börsch-Supan et al., 2019). For instance, Qi et al. (2018) showed how the 1994 Swedish pension reform, which introduced notional defined contributions to improve the financial sustainability of the pension system, succeeded in increasing the average retirement age of Swedish workers, but mostly for less vulnerable, more qualified males.====The extension of working lives is evident not only in international cross-sectional figures, such as those mentioned above, but also in longitudinal studies examining individuals’ retirement pathways in different national contexts during the 2000s and 2010s (Baumann and Madero-Cabib, 2019, Calvo et al., 2018, Madero-Cabib et al., 2020, Wahrendorf et al., 2017a, Worts et al., 2016). These longitudinal studies have yielded two main findings regarding extended working lives. First, they indicate that, despite the prevalence of early retirement pathways in multiple countries, 50% to 60% of workers have followed pathways that include “on-time” or late retirement in the last two decades. Second, and more importantly, these studies reflect the diversified reality of older adults’ labor market participation and gradual retirement before definitive retirement (i.e., full inactivity). Older people are increasingly working in full- or part-time jobs beyond retirement age, either as employees or through self-employment; partly retiring from the labor force (i.e., combining pension income with part-time employment income); unretiring (i.e., engaging in postretirement full-time work); or moving continuously in and out of the labor market. Consequently, a standardized retirement transition consisting of a one-time labor market exit from a full-time job as an employee at FPA is ceasing to be the norm (Baumann and Madero-Cabib, 2019). Thus, diverse pathways of gradual withdrawal from the labor market are becoming salient (Kantarci and Van Soest, 2008, OECD, 2019).====Research on the extension of working lives has typically focused on wealthier countries with aged populations and more generous social security. Also, most studies thus far have examined what determines whether older people remain attached to the labor market in old age, neglecting both the diversity of their labor force statuses and the determinants of such diversity (Nolan and Barrett, 2019).====In this study, we aim to address both shortcomings by studying the diversity of labor force statuses beyond FPA in a less wealthy setting and how previous life experiences affect this work diversity. Specifically, we analyze the extension of working lives in Chile, a developing country with few policies aimed explicitly at the extension of work beyond FPA, where this phenomenon has seen a dramatic rise in the last few decades. Then, following life-course studies that show how working status in old age stems from long and generative processes rooted in the individuals’ accumulation of advantages and disadvantages across earlier life stages, particularly in the two life domains of work and family (Wildman, 2020), we analyze how lifetime employment and coresidential trajectories determine both the extension of working lives beyond FPA and the diverse labor force statuses of older workers. To this end, we draw on a rich and comprehensive life history dataset of a cohort of Chileans currently aged 65–75 (i.e., born between 1944 and 1954) and on both longitudinal and cross-sectional statistical methods.====In what follows, we first review current explanations of extending work in old age and place them in the context of the challenges faced by developing countries and the Chilean cohort examined in this study. Second, we present a novel and comprehensive longitudinal dataset of older persons, along with the methods that we used to reconstruct employment and coresidential trajectories and to estimate their effects on extended working lives. Third, we show the main results of our analyses. Fourth, we discuss our findings in relation to the literature and draw attention to the particularities of work extension in the Chilean context. Fifth, we conclude and indicate some policy implications.",Lifetime employment–coresidential trajectories and extended working life in Chile,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X21000037,15 January 2021,2021,Research Article,68.0

Alternatively, when RCTs are too costly or infeasible, so-called natural or quasi-experimental designs are applied to observational data as the second best option after RCTs. While the core assumption of these studies, exogeneity of treatment, is debatable under certain circumstances.==== A large body of literature has also devoted to understanding the political economic sources of policy variation, which may provide a basis for selecting “control groups” to compare, or improve the identification of instruments for the policy (See examples from Besley and Case, 1995a, Besley and Case, 1995b, Poterba, 1994, Besley and Case, 2000). More recently, Hoynes and her coauthors explored the political determinants on the introduction of Food Stamp Program (FSP), the largest transfer programs targeting the low-income population in the US, and studied its impacts on household consumption, labor market outcomes and long-term health (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2009, Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2012, Hoynes et al., 2016). However, vast majority of the studies focus on US political economy or other democratic regimes, with little or limited enlightenment for developing countries, especially countries of non-democratic political regimes like China.====In this study, we provide novel evidence on how political regime may drive policy variation in Chinese context by exploring a national pilot of social pension policy, the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS). Rollout of NRPS started at county-by-county base in 2009, and the central government of China planned to spread out the policy to all counties by 2020. In the beginning stage of the national pilot, the number of counties enrolled increased steadily. But after two years, the pilot was pushed forward much faster than expected and it achieved the universal coverage goal in only 4 years after 2009. The national pilot of NRPS is considered as a natural experiment in many studies. Hunag and Zhang (2016) uses county rollout timing variation and Difference-in-Difference (DD) design to identify Average Treatment Effects (ATEs) of NRPS on several household outcomes, i.e. household income, food expenditure, labor supply, health and child care. The other brand of studies identify the Local Average Treatment Effects (LATEs) of NRPS by exploiting the variation of county rollout timing as instruments for individual pension receipt (Cheng et al., 2018b, Cheng et al., 2018a, Shu, 2018).====In this study, we find the selection of pilot experiments is not only subjected to the local socio-economic environment, but it also relies on the political regime. We match the county rollout year of NRPS with county socio-economic characteristics and prefecture government leaders’ backgrounds who could have impact on county enrolling decision. The findings in this study show that counties may trade off the costs and benefits of NRPS pilot under the government budget constraint. Counties with lower pilot costs, i.e. less population and less share of aging population, are more likely to enroll into the national pilot during the first two years of the program. Counties with higher pilot benefits, measured by grain output, are also more likely to enroll at the beginning stage. Government revenue is also highly correlated with early rollout decision. In addition, counties with more beds in hospitals are positively correlated with early enrollment decision, which may reveal the heterogeneity of “local policy preference”.====This study finds government officials in prefectures, which are collection of counties, may have impacts on county enrolling decision into NRPS pilot under China’s meritocracy political system. When testing the correlation of prefecture leaders’ backgrounds with county enrolling decision, we find that hometown connections between prefecture party secretaries and superior officials are negatively correlated with county NRPS pilot early enrollment decision. The connections to provincial and military leaders demonstrate stronger effects, but the effects of connections to central government leaders are much weaker. The effects are also weaker among newly appointed local party secretaries. On the other hand, connections between local grassroots and superior officials, measured by send-down movement experience of top officials, are positively correlated with county early enrollment into the program. Our findings suggest that connected prefecture secretaries have more incentives on economic performance, thus they prefer social welfare program less than unconnected officials. While superior officials’ connections with grassroots may push local authorities to promote social welfare programs. As second highest ranked in the prefecture government, the effects of prefecture city mayors’ social connections are statistically insignificant.====In order to characterize these findings, we build a simple principle-agent framework that considers the role of social connections and other local determinants under prefecture secretaries’ multitask with economic performance and social welfare outcomes. The principle (superior official) uses a tournament framework for the economic performance measure and piece rate incentives for the social welfare program. The model shows that if social connections substantially increase principle’s learning on agent (prefecture secretary)’s ability, rather than narrow down her uncertainty of economic performance, connected agents are discouraged to implement social welfare programs and make more efforts in economic performance. The framework extends Jia et al., 2015, Serrato et al., 2019’s studies by allowing the agent to care about both his own promotion and social welfare. It also extends previous studies by analyzing on public resource allocation under government budget constraints.====Our research is not a challenge to existing studies on NRPS or other policy studies in non-democratic developing countries. We find local governments, especially prefectures, have much less discretion of enrolling behavior in the first year of national pilot. While we show the pilot decision making of NRPS might be driven by some underling political economic forces, most of the policy variation still remain unexplained. The relative weakness of the fit of the model could be even viewed as strength of the designs that utilize the county level policy variation (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2009). Nevertheless, this study enriches our knowledge on policy decision making by extending it to an event study in a non-democratic country. So do we contribute on what might be important to control if researchers are able to further test the immunity of their findings to political economic forces in China or other non-democratic economy.====Our paper is also linked to two other fields of literature. Firstly, it is linked to the literature on the role of social connections in the Chinese meritocracy political regime. Studies in recent years have shown mixed directions of social connections. While most studies find provincial leaders are more likely to be promoted if they are connected with top leaders (Jia et al., 2015, Persson and Zhuravskaya, 2016), Fisman et al. (2020) find the effects turn into negative when group fixed effects are added into the empirical model. Jiang (2018) finds the reverse causality in a sample of city leaders. The patronage ties of city leaders to incumbent provincial leaders achieves faster economic growth after city leaders’ promotion which indicates that it is not clear whether a promotion leads to economic growth or economic growth causes promotion of the city leader. Furthermore, provincial leaders are found to favor connected city leaders in the selection of industrial parks sites, which could result in misallocation of capital (Kahn et al., 2018). This study is, to our knowledge, the first to formally test the role of social connections in China’s policy expansion. Secondly, our findings also add more evidence on the effects of send-down movement during Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). A recent study of Chen et al. (2020) finds send-down movement has long-term improvement on rural child education. Our findings suggest it could also improve rural social welfare in send-down destinations of the country’s top officials.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In contrast, for females, we observed a constant increase in the participation for the women in reproductive ages. Our forecasts indicate that older adults' labor force will decline in the future to levels compared to more developed economies. They also suggest that the expected length of retirement might increase from 12.5% to about 20%, from 1993 to 2035, of males adult working lives and from 11.47% to 27.41% for females. These trends, associated with population aging and longer life expectancy, reduce the ratio between workers and retirees, affecting the basic premise of the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) system. The proposed model to forecast labor force rates works well in Brazil's case and provides essential insights into the future of the system. Analysis of pension sustainability should consider population aging as well as trends in labor force rates.","Population aging has increased the concern regarding the sustainability of the public support programs for the elderly, especially pension programs (Bloom and Canning, 2004, Lee and Edwards, 2002, Lee, 2020, Bongaarts, 2004, Li, 2017). Whereas financial support for the elderly came from their family in the past, today, it comes from government programs and, in some cases, the private sector (Costa, 1998, Lee and Mason, 2011).====In general, these programs are vital to narrow the income gap between seniors and working-age individuals and to reduce elderly poverty rates (Gruber and Wise, 2001, Lee and Mason, 2011). The basis for most of them is the PAYGO system, where contributions levied from current workers finance retirement benefits, giving the workers an expectation of future retirement benefits in return for their contributions. The balance of such programs has been facing severe fiscal and financial problems (Bongaarts, 2004, Bloom and McNikkon, 2010), especially with the increase in the ratio between retirees and taxpayers, population aging, and changes in the labor force participation of the elderly (Bongaarts, 2004, Bloom and McNikkon, 2010, De Souza et al., 2019).====Although there is unabated interest among researchers in issues regarding the impacts of population aging and economic development to social security sustainability in developed countries (Gruber and Wise, 2005, Gruber and Wise, 2008, Wise, 2004, Coile, 2015), there are not many studies focusing on emerging economies (Cuevas et al., 2017). Brazil presents a unique context to establish linkages between population aging and public pension systems. The rapidly aging population presents itself as one of the most significant public policy challenges (Turra et al., 2011, Queiroz and Figoli, 2014, Queiroz, 2017, Cuevas et al., 2017). Compared to other developing economies, Brazil is distinct for combining a relatively large public sector, spending about 15% of GDP on public pension programs, with a rapidly aging population and declining labor force participation rates at older ages (Turra et al., 2011, Queiroz, 2017, Queiroz and Figoli, 2014, Miller and Castanheira, 2013, De Souza et al., 2019). Population projections indicate a rise in the old-age dependency ratio up to 36% in 2050, compared to 10% in 2010 (United Nations, 2019). These changes in population age structure may impose severe pressures on the public sector (Turra et al., 2011, Queiroz and Figoli, 2014, Miller and Castanheira, 2013, Cuevas et al., 2017).====Several studies investigate and estimate the impact of changes in population age structure and longevity on retirement trends and public pension programs (Caetano, 2016, Miller and Castanheira, 2013, Rocha and Caetano, 2008). Still, most studies, especially in the case of Brazil, use life expectancy at a specific older age or the demographic dependency ratio, which, like other measures of population aging (Gietel-Basten et al., 2020, Sanderson and Scherbov, 2013, Hammer et al., 2015) is not the best way to evaluate the impacts of demographic dynamics on pension programs. Those measures do not consider changes in the labor force participation; that is, the percentage of workers contributing to the system or the transition rate into retirement. The support ratio, which compares workers contributing to retirees, also has some limitations since most analysis using this metric holds it constant for the future. However, the length of working life has fallen over time, which results from both the increase in educational attainment for younger workers and changes in retirement behavior (Soares, 2010, Queiroz, 2017, De Souza et al., 2019).====The fall in labor market participation for older workers (65 years and older) is striking: 22.3% of them were in the labor force in 2010 compared to 60% in 1970 (De Souza et al., 2019). Incorporating changes in labor force participation rates and retirement hazards is fundamental to understand better the dynamics of future public pension programs in countries such as Brazil. Over the last half-century, labor force participation rates for older males changed dramatically (De Souza et al., 2019, Queiroz, 2017, Soares, 2010). As the labor force declined steadily in Brazil since the 1960s, at the same time, life expectancy at retirement ages are increasing; implying that, in general, individuals are spending more time receiving pension benefits, but this also has important implications for savings behavior, accumulation of capital, public and private transfers (Lee, 2020).====In this paper, we analyze the evolution of the labor force participation rates for males and females in Brazil for the last three decades and estimate the expected length of retirement (Lee, 2001) until 2035. We argue that this measure provides a better estimate of the impacts of changes in mortality and labor force participation in the pension system. The expected length of retirement considers retirement hazards and survival probabilities. Instead of hold labor force constant, we use the Lee-Carter model (Lee and Carter, 1992) to forecast labor force participation rates from 2015 to 2035; we used the combination of these estimates, with mortality forecasts from the United Nations (United Nations, 2019) to estimate the expected length of retirement for the same period. Lee-Carter is a forecast method widely used for mortality projection; it is a versatile model and uses historical information to design future scenarios (Booth and Tickle, 2008). We argue that this is a better measure to evaluate the impact of changes in the population age structure and labor force in the public pension system instead of looking only at trends in the percentage of elderly and the labor force participation rates (Li, 2017, Frees, 2006).====The idea to forecast the labor force participation rates using a stochastic model is an important contribution of this paper. In general, the projection of such rates use deterministic models or do not consider past variation trends or even population dynamics, which directly affects the number of people in the labor force (Rios-Neto and Wajnman, 1994). To our knowledge, the Brazilian public pension system uses a similar model and is subject to many criticisms. The main one being the adoption of a fixed labor supply function at a given point of time. There are no studies or temporal hypotheses, and the total number of workers in the formal sector changes solely due to variations of the population by age. Some papers worked with age, period, and cohort models, but they are also subject to limitations (Rios-Neto and Hermeto, 1999). We argue that our approach, combined with estimates of population aging, are an useful tool to analyze the sustainability of the Brazilian public pension system. Most of the past research focus on comparing the expenditures to the GDP (Miller et al., 2011, Miller and Castanheira, 2013), in the relation between workers contributing to the system and individuals receiving benefits (Queiroz and Figoli, 2014) or simple analyzing trends in the old-age dependency ratios (Rocha and Caetano, 2008). However, none of these analyses incorporate major changes in the labor force participation of Brazilian workers in recent decades (De Souza et al., 2019, Queiroz, 2017).====The paper has some important findings. We observe a steady decline in the labor force participation of young adults and the elderly over time, mostly due to access to education and public pension programs. We find that the expected length of retirement might increase as people leave the labor force at an early age and live longer lives. This finding, in combination with international comparison, implies an impressive transformation in the Brazilian labor market. Concurrently, with population aging and longer life expectancy, the ratio between workers and retirees has significantly dropped, affecting the PAYGO system's basic premise and also with important implications to the savings rate to finance retirement. Our approach also has public policy implications since it provides an alternative way to forecast the Brazilian public pension system budget. First, the Brazilian public pension system forecasts its costs by holding labor force participation constant underestimating future trends. We also consider our estimates to be conservative since about 20% of the elderly in Brazil stay in the labor force while receiving retirement benefits. Second, the increasing duration of retirement implies that Brazilian workers should save an increasing proportion of their working income to support consumption after retirement. However, other studies indicate that government transfers are responsible for financing most of consumption at older ages in Brazil (Turra et al., 2011).",The evolution of labor force participation and the expected length of retirement in Brazil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300694,16 December 2020,2020,Research Article,70.0

Only the less educated group benefits directly from public redistribution, while the other three educational groups are net payers. Under plausible scenarios of educational expansion, net public flows result in a higher surplus in public accounts. A linear decomposition of the dynamic effects shows that this result is mainly driven by educational improvement, as the associated increase in outflows leads to a surplus in public accounts. In this way, the negative effect of changes in the age structure on net flows is counteracted. Redistributive tensions between educational groups also tend to dilute in the medium term because of educational expansion.","The study of how social protection is provided to and funded by different age and socioeconomic groups is a very relevant policy issue in the context of population aging and significant levels of inequality. Uruguay represents a clear example of a country with these characteristics.====The difference between the resources that individuals receive from the public sector (cash and in-kind transfers) and the payments they make (taxes and social security contributions), also known as net public transfers, has generally been analyzed with a focus on the flows between age groups or socioeconomic groups. However, the joint consideration of both age and socioeconomic variables is still scarce in the literature. The analysis of the prospective interaction between net public transfers and population dynamics is even scanter. In this article, we address these issues for Uruguay by deriving age profiles of public transfers and taxes for different educational groups and applying them to population projections disaggregated by both age and educational attainment. For the population projections, we also consider different scenarios of educational expansion.====Our work builds on the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) framework, an information system consistent with the National Account System, reflecting economic flows by age. NTA provides estimates of the average labor income and the average consumption of goods and services in a year at each age. Based on this information, the life cycle deficit (consumption minus labor income) by age can be estimated. Also, the system gives estimates of the economic flows among age groups (generations) that finance that life cycle deficit: savings, public transfers, and private transfers. In general terms, the age profile of labor income and consumption are similar across countries: labor income is bell-shaped, whereas consumption increases during childhood before reaching a plateau (Mason and Lee, 2011). However, in a study of 34 countries, Mason and Lee (Mason and Lee, 2012) highlight some variations in both variables. Children’s labor income is higher in low- and middle-income countries than in upper-middle and high-income countries. In high-income countries, labor income peaks later and decreases more sharply than in other countries, reflecting the coverage of pension programs. On the other hand, consumption by children and the elderly relative to consumption by working adults is higher in high-income countries than in others.====There are also similar patterns between countries in the channels of support of the life cycle deficit. The international evidence is consistent in finding that the working-age population contributes to funding children and young people, mainly through the public system (benefits and taxes) and family resources. However, some differences should be noted. Mason et al. (Mason et al., 2016) show that 80% of human capital investment in children in high-income countries comes from public sources. However, this share descends to 60% in middle- and lower-income countries where intra-household resources gain importance.====Meanwhile, the elderly are mainly funded by the public system and their previous savings (Mason and Lee, 2011). Interestingly, in a recent study of European countries, Gal et al. (Gál et al., 2018) add unpaid household production to monetary transfers. They begin their analysis based on the fact that European welfare states assign more (per capita) resources to the elderly than to children. But, when adding private transfers, including time transfers, the picture reverses. Within countries, the role as recipient or contributor to the public system also varies by economic level. In a study on Spain, Abio et al. (Abio et al., 2017) find that educated households tend to contribute more to the public system through contributions and taxes and depend less on its benefits.====In Latin America, the current high levels of inequality have motivated the analysis of intergenerational public flows by socioeconomic group. In most cases, the classification of individuals into socioeconomic groups uses the educational level of the head of the household. Along these lines, Mejía-Guevara (Mejía-Guevara, 2015) assesses the effects of socioeconomic inequality on the reallocation of intergenerational flows for Mexico and shows that expenditure on education remained almost constant in relative terms between 1994 and 2004. However, the composition by age and socioeconomic group changed significantly, with more resources devoted to primary and secondary education and the lowest socioeconomic group. Likewise, Turra and Queiroz (Turra and Queiroz, 2005) analyze intergenerational transfers in Brazil for different groups. They show that children from worse-off families rely more on public transfers, mainly in the form of public education.====In contrast, elderly consumption for every socioeconomic level is heavily financed by public transfers (mainly social security and health spending). For Chile, Miller et al. (Miller et al., 2014) show striking differences in the consumption level between groups, with relatively constant gaps across ages. They find exceptionally high levels of inequality in educational investment in Chilean youth. An alternative measure of inequality is introduced in the study of intergenerational transfers by Tovar and Urdinola (Tovar and Urdinola, 2014) for Colombia. Defining socioeconomic groups according to a multidimensional quality of life index, they find that the wealthiest portion of the population is responsible for the largest public outflows and inflows. This pattern is mainly explained by the social security system, which is highly skewed towards the wealthiest portion of the population. They also show that there are disproportionate differences between the health expenditure for the elderly and the young. Defining socioeconomic groups by household income quintile, Turra et al. (Turra et al., 2011) show that allocations of resources across generations and age groups influence public transfers across income groups in Chile and Brazil. The impact of education spending is neutral in both countries, while health care spending is slightly progressive, and public pensions are strongly regressive. Given that both countries have achieved high levels of coverage for their elderly populations and that children are disproportionately represented in low-income groups and the elderly in high-income groups, the public sector ends up financing a higher proportion of the consumption of the relatively better-off elderly.====In the case of Uruguay, previous studies have shown that net public transfers are higher in per capita terms for the population at older ages when compared to those received by children and adolescents (Bucheli and González, 2011, Bucheli and Troiano, 2016). The analysis of net public transfers by socioeconomic group remains unexplored for the country, taking into account the joint consideration of age and socioeconomic groups. This is even though persistent inequality is a characteristic of Uruguay. We aim to address this gap by examining the intergenerational net public transfers in Uruguay by educational level.====Nevertheless, we also acknowledge that the result of redistributive policies is endogenous to demographic change. Therefore, to discuss the prospects of fiscal accounts and public redistribution, it is crucial to consider the dimension of population dynamics in our analysis. Declining mortality and fertility rates have implied changes in the Uruguayan population's age structure, and this process will continue in the coming decades. In light of these significant changes, our second aim is to analyze the link between the evolution of population aging and intergenerational transfers, considering different scenarios of educational expansion.====The potential role of educational expansion on the economic dependency ratio (the ratio between the unemployed and non-active and the employed population) has been widely discussed (see (Mason and Lee, 2011, Mason et al., 2016). Decreasing fertility levels may lead to an increase in per-child expenditure in education and health, as proposed by the quantity-quality theory (Becker and Lewis, 1973). This increased investment in human capital at an early age might improve the quality and productivity of the labor force and offset-at least partially-the decline in the relative number of workers and the negative consequences of population aging in the long run. Along these lines, using the NTA framework, Prskawetz and Hammer (Prskawetz and Hammer, 2018) combine educational groups and population aging and show that, in Austria, the increase in the economic dependency ratio that is projected to take place by 2050 is less dramatic once changes in educational levels are taken into account. Likewise, and based on the estimation of a structural model, Abrigo et al. (Abrigo et al., 2018) consider the impact of expanding human capital investments on productivity, inequality, and fiscal balances in developing Asian countries. They find that higher labor productivity boosts output and income and reduces income inequality, without damaging fiscal balances, as the positive effect of the expansion of the tax base is higher than the increase in public spending on education.====Rentería et al. (Rentería et al., 2016) estimate the age-profiles of consumption and labor income for Spain and Mexico and apply them to population projections by age and educational attainment. In both countries, educational expansion delayed the onset of the negative effect of the decreasing working-age population on economic growth. Along the same lines, Lutz et al. (Lutz et al., 2019) underline the importance of implementing education policy in order to take advantage of the positive effect that demographic transition can have on economic growth.====This paper contributes to the ongoing literature by simultaneously analyzing the dual challenges that inequality and population aging pose on the redistribution of resources in Uruguay. We apply estimated age profiles of public transfers and taxes for different educational groups to population projections, disaggregated both by age and educational attainment. In this way, we specifically address whether the aging of the Uruguayan economy will perpetuate inequalities in net public transfers or whether it might act as an equalizing force under the trend of increasing educational attainment.","Aging, education and intergenerational flows in Uruguay",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300712,7 December 2020,2020,Research Article,71.0

In contrast to this alarming development, Abeliansky and Strulik (2019, A&S), in one of the few studies of long-term health developments in Europe, find improving health trends in Europe across a broad range of cohorts. We conducted a ==== of health deficits similar to A&S but focused on middle-aged individuals. We find that the positive health trend has all but stalled for the more recent birth cohorts in Europe. Our results are robust to a large range of different definitions of the health index. We argue that the difference between A&S and our results is due to longitudinal sample selectivity bias. Our findings have implications for future public and private costs of health care, and they are relevant for the ongoing discussion on how to achieve longer healthy working lives.","European citizens enjoy a higher life expectancy (OECD, 2019), a higher healthy life expectancy (WHO, 2019) and better health on average (Avendano et al., 2009, Avendano and Kawachi, 2014) than US citizens. Moreover, not only the increase in US life expectancy has stalled as recent data show====, but also US baby boomers, despite their longer life expectancy over previous generations, have higher rates of chronic disease, more disability, and lower self-rated health than members of the previous generation at the same age (King et al., 2013).====The paper by Abeliansky and Strulik (2019, A&S), published recently in this journal, is one of the few studies of long-term health developments in Europe. A&S use panel data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and compute the health deficits of individuals aged 50 to 85 in 14 European countries by birth cohort. They find that European health trends stand in stark contrast to the developments in the United States: health deficits still keep declining for older individuals as well as for more recently born cohorts, both for men and women. A&S argue that this continuous trend approximates the rate of medical progress.====While this is a pleasant result for Europeans, there are several reasons to be surprised by the findings of A&S. Medical progress is shared globally without much delay. If anything, medical technology – procedures, equipment and drugs – is more advanced in the US than in Europe. One may argue that in the US top medical technology is only accessible for the well-to-do while it is more equitably distributed in Europe. However, also Europe has faced a trend in rising inequality and an increase in the socio-economic gradient of health and life expectancy (e.g., Mackenbach et al. (2016)). Since the research by A&S is an important contribution to understanding cross-national health differences and their causes, it is essential to check the robustness of the A&S results.====We therefore investigated the sensitivity of their cohort analysis to different definitions of the applied health deficit index. We are able to replicate the results by A&S but found that they are sensitive to the selection of variables included in the health deficit index, in particular to including variables that are not observed in the later waves of the SHARE panel. We therefore employ a health index that only includes the variables that are available in all years of the panel data. We find similar results for older cohorts but reach strikingly different conclusions for middle-aged individuals. This difference is driven by only 4 out of the 38 health measures used by A&S. These variables are available in the early but not the most recent waves of SHARE. In econometric terms, this creates a sample selectivity bias since younger cohorts are more exposed to these missing variables. We argue that the disappearance of the variables from the panel artificially lowers the value of the index for the younger cohorts, thus creating the illusion of improving health conditions across Europe while, in fact, they are stagnating.====Our result of a stagnating health trend is robust to a large range of different definitions of the health index as long as the health measures are available throughout all waves. E.g., in order to avoid taking any stance on which variables are more important than others, we randomly choose sets of 35 and 40 variables out of 52 variables available in all waves and always reach similar results.====Our findings are relevant for the ongoing discussion on how to achieve longer healthy working lives and suggest that not only the US but also Europe may see a stalling of the long-term upwards health trend among individuals in their second half of life.",Long-run health trends in Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300682,1 December 2020,2020,Research Article,72.0

Among those 65+, Medicare and Social Security account for reductions in HIPM poverty of 15 to 25 percentage points and 35 to 40 percentage points, respectively. The average HIPM poverty gap after all transfers was 4% of the HIPM threshold among persons 65+ vs. 13% among those under 65. Compared to the SPM, the HIPM appears to classify a needier population as poor. Adopting a HIPM could provide more complete description of disadvantage across the age distribution and more accurate guidance for social policy (NAS 2019).","Over the past sixty years, the poverty rate among Americans aged 65 and older has fallen by nearly three-quarters, from over 35% in 1960 to 9.7% in 2018. The poverty rate for older persons, mostly retired, has often been less than half the rate for children, which currently stands at 16.2%, and has been below the poverty rate for adults aged 18 to 64 since the early 2000s (Semega and Kollar, 2019); Table B6). Elderly==== poverty also appears largely immune to economic recessions, most strikingly, falling through the severe recession of the early 1980s and remaining flat in the Great Recession, even as child poverty surged to 22%.====These are trends in the Official Poverty Measure (OPM), which does not account for the fact that a high proportion of those over-65 are eligible for public health insurance, Medicare. In contrast, many poor adults under age 65 remain ineligible for Medicaid, despite generous federal funding provided in the Affordable Care Act for state Medicaid expansions.====The rise in the relative economic status of the elderly, broadly speaking, has been attributed to increasing public transfers, especially Social Security and Medicare, as well as economic growth, all of which have allowed successive cohorts to arrive at older ages with greater economic security than preceding cohorts (e.g., (Bosworth et al., 2016, Engelhardt et al., 2006, Preston, 1984, Scholz et al., 2009, Poterba et al., 2012, Scholz and Seshardi, 2008).====However, the publication in 2011 of a new Census poverty measure, the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM; (Short, 2011), raised doubts about this conclusion as it showed the population aged 65 and older to be much poorer than indicated by the Official Poverty Measure (OPM; e.g., (Wimer et al., 2016, Cubanski et al., 2018). The SPM for 2018 put the elderly poverty rate at 13.6%, over 40% higher than the OPM rate of 9.7% (Fox, 2019). The SPM also raised poverty rates of the elderly relative to those for other ages. Although at 9.7% the OPM rate for the elderly falls below the OPM rate for non-elderly adults (10.7%) and children (15.9%), the 13.6% SPM rate for the elderly exceeds the corresponding rate for non-elderly adults (12.5%), and approaches the SPM rate for children (14.5%). Are the elderly much better off than children, as suggested by the OPM, or are they similarly disadvantaged, as suggested by the SPM?====US poverty measures attempt to capture whether a family’s income is greater than a threshold level considered adequate. The SPM improves upon the OPM in many respects (Haveman et al., 2015). Critically, the SPM better captures the resources available to a household by including as income the value of in-kind government benefits that can be used to pay for necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter (Fox, 2019).====Health care is also widely considered a necessity. And the US federal and state governments pay for most of the health care for the older population through public insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet the SPM threshold does not explicitly incorporate a need for health insurance or health care. Instead, the SPM subtracts from family income all Medical Out-of-Pocket expenditures (MOOP) on health insurance premiums, cost sharing (co-payments and deductibles), direct payments to providers, prescription drugs, and over-the-counter medications. The SPM therefore treats MOOP as non-discretionary expenses, like taxes, that reduce income available for non-health necessities (Citro and Michael, 1995).====Empirically, the subtraction of MOOP expenditures from household resources explains the entire difference between the OPM and SPM elderly poverty rate. When the Census Bureau makes all SPM adjustments to the OPM other than the MOOP subtraction from resources, the elderly poverty rate falls slightly, from 9.7% to 9.6%. When it then subtracts MOOP expenditures, the elderly poverty rate rises to 13.6%, a 42 percent increase in the rate (Fox, 2019). Clearly, many older people have substantial MOOP expenditures, making the poverty rate highly sensitive to their treatment and raising the relative poverty rate of the elderly compared to that of children and adults under age 65.====The SPM’s revisions were guided by recommendations of a 2010 inter-agency working group on poverty measurement (Census Bureau, 2010) which, in turn, based recommendations on a 1995 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report, ==== (Citro and Michael, 1995), as well as subsequent research. The recommendations to subtract MOOP expenditures and not to value health insurance as a resource were driven by practical difficulties of implementing a poverty measure that includes health, due to the nature of health care and the complexities of the US health care system (Korenman and Remler, 2013, Korenman and Remler, 2016). The result is a measure of non-health, material poverty. This approach has several drawbacks.====First, by excluding health care needs from the poverty threshold and health insurance benefits from resources, the SPM may misclassify persons by poverty status. Those who have enough resources to just afford non-health necessities but who receive no public or private insurance benefits could be classified as non-poor by the SPM even though they cannot afford basic health care (e.g., they cannot afford to purchase insurance privately). If such persons need care but cannot get it, or, in order to avoid out-of-pocket spending, do not seek needed care, they may not spend much out-of-pocket. In that case, the SPM would not classify them as poor, yet they have unmet health care needs.====Second, to the extent that some out-of-pocket spending on health care or insurance is partly discretionary, the SPM can misclassify as poor some persons who are able to afford health insurance, health care and non-health necessities. This concern is particularly relevant to retirees with moderate incomes but substantial assets who purchase high-quality supplemental health insurance (Hurd and Rodhwedder, 2006, Meyer and Sullivan, 2010).====Third, because the SPM threshold includes no explicit health care or insurance need, it cannot be used to show the direct impact of health insurance benefits on poverty as it is regularly used to show the impacts of other benefits (e.g., (Fox, 2019). The SPM can show how health insurance benefits reduce poverty only indirectly, by reducing MOOP (Sommers and Oellerich, 2013, Zewde and Wimer, 2019). The SPM cannot show the access value of health insurance: how it enables the use of valuable medical care that the uninsured may forego (Nyman, 2003). Because the SPM does not capture the resource value of health insurance benefits, it also cannot show how health insurance benefits help fill the “poverty gap”: the amount by which the resources of the poor fall short of the poverty threshold (e.g., Ben-Shalom et al., 2012, Meyer and Wu, 2018).====Fourth, by subtracting MOOP expenditures from resources, the SPM procedures can distort estimates of the impact of health insurance benefits on poverty. For example, when the government or an employer provides a household highly subsidized health insurance benefits that require a modest premium payment, the SPM subtracts the premium from household income (making the household poorer) but does not add to resources a value for the health insurance benefit that the premium purchases. This procedure can produce misleading estimates of the impacts of the ACA insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansions (Remler et al., 2017, Korenman et al., 2019b).====Finally, the SPM may distort comparisons of poverty rates between the over-65 and under-65 populations since, due to the Medicare program, uninsurance rates are much lower among those over age 65, yet the SPM does not incorporate health insurance resources.====To address these shortcomings, Korenman and Remler (Korenman and Remler, 2016) developed a Health Inclusive Poverty Measure (HIPM). The HIPM modifies the SPM to capture health insurance needs and benefits, thereby allowing measurement of the direct impact on poverty of health insurance benefits such as Medicare and Medicaid (Remler et al., 2017). Based on these analyses, a 2019 National Academy of Sciences committee on reducing child poverty commissioned a study of the impact of Medicaid on child poverty using the HIPM (Korenman et al., 2019b). The Committee report recommended that US Statistical agencies “move expeditiously to evaluate a health-inclusive poverty measure (HIPM)” for adoption (National Academies of Sciences, 2019, Recommendation 9–8, p. 9–12).====The present paper is an investigation of health-inclusive poverty among the older US population. Our prior research used the HIPM to estimate the impacts of health and social policies under the Affordable Care Act for the population under age 65 (Remler et al., 2017; Korenman et al., 2019b). Here we use the HIPM to describe the impact of Medicare benefits, other public and private health insurance benefits and other social benefits on elderly poverty. We compare poverty rates and the sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly poor according to the SPM and HIPM, demonstrating how the characteristics of the impoverished population differ between the HIPM and SPM.====The consequences of using the HIPM rather than the SPM differ qualitatively by age. For the population under age 65, differences are driven mainly by those who do not have health insurance benefits from government or employers. The HIPM rate exceeds the SPM rate under age 65 because only the HIPM can detect poverty that results when those who lack health insurance benefits cannot meet their full needs: material and health insurance. In contrast, the large majority of those over 65 have Medicare and so only for a small subset of the elderly does lack of health insurance benefits potentially drive HIPM poverty rates above SPM poverty rates. Among Medicare beneficiaries, the HIPM rate is generally lower than the SPM rate, because the HIPM caps the deduction from resources for out-of-pocket spending on insurance premiums.====Differences between the SPM and HIPM elderly poverty rates also differ across demographic groups, largely driven by differences in the prevalence of health benefits, rather than capping of premiums. For example, HIPM poverty is two to three percentage points lower than SPM poverty among Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites, but the difference is essentially zero among Hispanics, reflecting their lower rates of health insurance benefits.====The elderly population classified as poor by the HIPM appears more disadvantaged than the population classified as poor by the SPM. This is true whether or not we anchor the HIPM elderly poverty rate to equal the SPM rate (i.e., compare the poorest 13.7% of the population ages 65 and older according to each measure). Although the populations classified as poor by the two measures overlap substantially, characteristics of the poor differ starkly when the two measures differ. Older persons classified as poor only by the HIPM are far more likely to be uninsured and less-educated. In contrast, those classified as poor only by the SPM have somewhat higher incomes and spend considerably more on health insurance premiums.====We also quantify the impact of health insurance benefits on elderly poverty rates. HIPM analyses show that Medicare accounts for a large reduction in poverty among the elderly, second in importance only to Social Security. Among the elderly who are “pre-transfer poor”, Medicare, Social Security and other transfer programs reduce the depth of poverty by an amount that, on average, equals nearly 70% of the HIPM threshold, leaving a HIPM poverty gap of only 3.7% after all transfers.==== Analyses such as these are possible only with a health inclusive poverty measure.====The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the HIPM for the older population, and the implications of our findings for understanding of the relative economic status of the older population and for public policy.",Health insurance and poverty of the older population in the United States: The importance of a health inclusive poverty measure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300621,28 October 2020,2020,Research Article,74.0

The estimates show an average of 8.1–9.0% reductions in the count of depressive symptoms attributable to the reform. We also find that the mental health benefit comes primarily from beneficiaries being more satisfied with their financial condition and overall quality of life. However, despite the large increase in income there were no significant improvements in grip strength and self-rated health. Overall, this study highlights the importance of social pension as a means of protecting mental health of disadvantaged seniors.","Social Security systems in the U.S. and many other high-income countries have built upon a contributory scheme in which a fixed proportion of the labor income is taxed to support the system. In countries where the labor market informality is high, however, a traditional pay-as-you-go pension could not fully scale-up and left a large proportion of the population without pension coverage (van Ginneken, 1999). In response, a growing number of countries have introduced social pension or supplementary income support for seniors. Social pension is a government-provided cash transfer in which access to benefits does not require a contributory record. The provision/expansion of social pension has proved to be an efficient way to alleviate the depth of poverty as well as its incidence among older persons (Barrientos and Lloyd-Sherlock, 2002, Case and Deaton, 1998, Kaushal, 2014).====An important, yet underexplored, hypothesis is whether more generous social pension program leads to better health. From a public health perspective, the provision of pension income can enable the poor to avoid exposure to harmful environments and adopt practices beneficial to health (Phelan et al., 2010). For instance, beneficiaries would be able to use pension income to move to a safer or cleaner living environment, upgrade household facilities for better sanitation, or consume nutritious meals that they need to maintain good health (Case, 2004). For those who have forgone medical care due to cost-related reasons, additional cash benefit would afford an opportunity whereby the desired level of healthcare consumption can be achieved (Lloyd-Sherlock and Agrawal, 2014). Moreover, increases in non-labor income promote a transition into retirement, which allows individuals to move away from hazardous and stressful working environments. The argument that retirement improves health is particularly relevant to low-income workers who were engaging in risky and heavy physical work before retirement (Kuhn, 2018).====While the positive impact pension support has on health seems theoretically validated, the magnitude of the effect is contingent on a number of potentially offsetting factors. The first is the extent to which additional pension income increases the consumption of unhealthy goods (e.g., alcohol, candies, drugs, and tobacco). Social pension is primarily the income support program in which benefits can be spent on any goods, including essential and non-essential ones. Under the plausible assumption that income elasticity with respect to unhealthy goods is positive, cash transfer through social pension could promote unhealthy behaviors and partially offset the health benefits realized through the channels mentioned above.====A negative social image associated with government support is another pathway that could contract beneficiaries’ health and well-being (Stuber and Schlesinger, 2006). Social stereotype tends to discriminate against people on government support, labeling them a failure, lazy, and burden to society (Krause, 1996). A link between government support and emotional discomfort among beneficiaries has been well reported in psychiatric research (Dooley and Prause, 2002, Qi and Wu, 2018).====Empirical studies regarding health-social pension correlation have yielded mixed results. Of the slim evidence to date, pension income was found to have a positive influence on self-rated health in households’ pooling income (Case, 2004) or to reduce depressive symptoms among poor rural populations (Galiani et al., 2016, Salinas-Rodríguez et al., 2014). In China, pension provision to rural residents improved physical health but had no discernible impact on self-rated health and psychological well-being (Cheng et al., 2018). Evidence from Colombia (Hessel et al., 2018) showed a positive association between cash transfer and self-rated health in disadvantaged older men, but not in women. A randomized experimental study by Aguila et al. (2015) demonstrated that a significant portion of income supplement was spent on doctor visits and medications, leading to improvements in lung function, memory, and hemoglobin levels of beneficiaries. Despite some evidence of health benefits, findings from this line of research vastly differ in terms of health outcomes and the characteristics of beneficiaries examined.====This study delves into the social pension expansion in South Korea (Korea, hereafter) and its impact on population health. One of the major social problems for Korea has been a large number of seniors entering retirement without pension income, contributing to the highest rate of elderly poverty among OECD countries. To address this issue, the Korean government introduced a social pension scheme in 2008. This program was further expanded in July 2014 in an attempt to provide monthly benefits that are large enough to mitigate elderly poverty, particularly for the generation not covered by the compulsory national pension. In this paper, we study the spillover effects of the 2014 social pension expansion on health of beneficiaries. We conduct a series of difference-in-differences analysis that compares pre- vs. post-expansion changes in health outcomes of the eligible group relative to the non-eligible group. The 2014 expansion presents a unique opportunity to isolate the causal effect of social pension because the potential beneficiary group was changed unexpectedly as the reform was implemented. This setting enables us to minimize the confounding effect of voluntary consumption changes in anticipation that income will rise permanently.====Results showed that the 2014 expansion of the Korean social pension was associated with significant reductions in the count of depressive symptoms and the prevalence of clinical depression, holding other covariates constant. It also suggested that increased satisfaction with financial condition and overall quality of life is the primary mechanism the reform has produced mental health benefits. Other pathways, such as retirement, changes in health behavior, and increased access to healthcare, were found to have a limited mediating role. Furthermore, there was no evidence that other health domains, with regard to measures of grip strength and self-rated health, were improved in response to the reform. Our findings indicate significant mental health benefits and a likely decline in suicide among disadvantaged seniors, given a close link between depression and suicidal behaviors among poor elders in Korea.====This study makes several contributions to the literature on the health effect of social pension. First, we demonstrate improvements in mental health resulting from a declining prevalence of major depression. Our analyses below show that the estimated pension effect is not merely picking up a transient mood change but also capture a meaningful reduction in clinical depression, which will have an important implication for mortality benefits. Second, we provide evidence for the health effect of social pension in a relatively well-developed country. Currently, most existing evidence in this strand of research has been reported from developing countries in which health benefit of cash transfer is likely to arise from curing disease associated with poverty and insanitation (e.g., infectious and communicable disease). In our study, we look into the case of a developed economy where people are more likely to suffer from relative poverty and die with “diseases of affluence” like cancer and suicide. Third, our analyses demonstrate an alternative pathway through which social pension expansion could yield health benefits, namely a subjective well-being channel. This finding complements the existing evidence of health gains through increased access to health care and nutrition reported in developing countries (Aguila et al., 2018).",What are the effects of expanding social pension on health?

Our study draws on the Singapore Life Panel to assess how trust ties to older respondents’ (1) pension plan participation and withdrawals; (2) life, health, and long-term care insurance holdings; and (3) stock market engagement. We show that the widely-used ‘trust in people’ question is uncorrelated with household behaviours related to retirement preparedness. Instead, trust in private and public financial representatives is positively associated with pension savings, investments, and insurance holdings. Financial literacy also plays an important and consistent role in retirement decision-making.","Trust can be defined as the “subjective probability (that) individuals attribute to the possibility of being cheated” (Guiso et al., 2008), and in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, public levels of trust in institutions fell precipitously around the world (Close, 2016, Sapienza and Zingales, 2012). Moreover, financial institutions remain among the least-trusted of all entities in the post-crisis environment (Edelman, 2018). Nevertheless, a growing and rapidly aging population faces an ever-longer retirement period, making it increasingly necessary for people to engage with financial and governmental institutions to save more and invest more efficiently for the long term. Indeed, restoring peoples’ trust in institutions is likely to be central to successful retirement for generations to come. Particularly important in this setting is trust in pension institutions, pivotal in converting workers’ deferred earnings into benefits payable over the retirement period.====The subject of people’s trust in other persons and in institutions has long been a topic of interest to economists.==== Knack and Keefer (1997) examined trust patterns using a question in the World Values Survey (WVS) and General Social Survey, to the following effect: ==== Much research has explored whether this conventional ‘trust in people’ question (hereafter referred to as ‘====’) was reliable in real-world situations, and the evidence indicates that individuals stating that “most people can be trusted” are also most trusting in investment experiments (Johnson and Mislin, 2012, Sapienza et al., 2013). Additionally, several different economic outcomes have been found to be positively associated with trust measured this way, including economic growth (Knack and Keefer, 1997), judicial efficiency (La Porta et al., 1997), income (Butler et al., 2016), public finance efficiency (Slemrod, 2003), participation in the stock market (Guiso et al., 2008), use of financial advice (Lachance and Tang, 2012), purchase of long-term care insurance (Lambregts and Schut, 2020) and household saving (Beckmann and Mare, 2017). More generally, Bartling et al. (2018) showed experimentally and theoretically that trust has a causal effect on the efficiency of human interactions in families, organizations, markets, and politics. Slemrod and Katuščák (2005) reported that exhibiting trust has a positive on income, while exhibiting trustworthiness has a negative impact on income. Also using WVS data, Fisman and O’Neill (2009) studied gender differences in beliefs on the returns to effort and found that women are consistently more likely to report that success is a matter of luck.====There is also recent work seeking to assess different dimensions of trust beyond the traditional WVS ==== question. For instance, Burke and Hung (2019) explored the relationships between trust and behaviours related to utilizing professional financial advice. Using data from the American Life Panel, their measure included five items: trust in the stock market, banks, insurance companies, stockbrokers, and investment advisers. Lachance and Tang (2012) examined the association between trust and financial advice-seeking behaviour using the U.S. National Financial Capability Study. The latter research included the ==== question as well as one additional question exploring trust in the financial sector (====).====A number of studies have examined the link between trust and various aspects of retirement preparedness, including planning for retirement, willingness to participate in pension plans, perceived financial preparedness for retirement, and non-default asset allocation choices in pensions (Segel-Karpas and Werner, 2014, Beckmann and Mare, 2017, Ricci and Caratelli, 2017, Deetlefs et al., 2019). Few authors, however, have investigated the relationship between trust and retirement wealth holdings. Beckmann and Mare (2017) analysis in developing economies, for example, considered whether households were more likely to save in formal versus informal instruments, and though they did ask whether respondents participated in pension plan participation in, they did not examine how much wealth was held in these accounts.====The present paper examines whether and how trust impacts multiple aspects of older peoples’ economic behaviour conducive to retirement security in a large, population-based sample in the nation of Singapore. The three domains which we focus on are: (1) pension plan participation and savings; (2) life, health, and long-term care insurance cover; and (3) capital market engagement and financial advice-seeking behaviour. We begin by assessing older Singaporeans’ overall level of trust in people using the WVS question, to compare to evidence from other countries. We then examine how the traditional WVS question stacks up against our more detailed trust questions eliciting respondent trust in insurance agents, bank financial advisors, non-bank financial advisors, civil servants, and pension fund agency officials. Finally, we assess whether our results are associated with key factors driving older adults’ financial outcomes. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we examine a broader set of retirement preparedness outcomes than has been explored previously. Second, we show that trust shapes savings and investment behaviour for older adults who already participate in pension plans. This is arguably a higher-level policy consideration in the context of developed countries where pension institutions are already fairly established and a large proportion of workers participate in pension plans through automatic enrolment or otherwise, versus the question of whether trust influences pension participation.====To preview our findings, we show that trust in institutional financial representatives generally has a more powerful effect on household economic behaviours than general trust in people. Our analyses reveal that responses to the WVS ==== question is largely uncorrelated with older household behaviours related to retirement saving, insurance cover, or investment. Moreover, ==== is only weakly linked to respondent characteristics about which we have information in our dataset. By contrast, we find that trust in institutional financial representatives, such as Central Provident Fund (CPF) representatives, is quite strongly associated with economic preparedness for retirement. The CPF board is the primary government agency administrating Singapore’s social security system. Trust in CPF officials is positively and significantly associated with higher pension balances and pension investing, holding other factors constant. Moreover, respondents significantly less confident in civil servants as well as bank and nonbank advisors are more likely to have withdrawn money from their CPF pension accounts once they are permitted to do so (at age 55). Turning to insurance behaviour, we find that ==== is not a statistically significant determinant, but respondents who trust insurance agents are much more likely to have all types of insurance, including life, health, and long-term care policies.====Our analysis of trust and engagement in the capital market also shows that ==== is uncorrelated with whether respondents invested in the stock market, and whether respondents sought financial advice from advisors. By contrast, trust in insurance agents does predict who invests in stocks and has a financial advisor, and trust in CPF officials is positively related to having a financial advisor. Additionally, financial literacy is generally positively related to trust, particularly trust in CPF officials, yet those who are financially savvy are less trusting of insurance agents, bank advisors, and nonbank advisors. We also find that the more financially literate hold higher pension plan balances, are more likely to invest in the stock market, and are more likely to have health, long-term care, and life insurance coverage. These conclusions are robust to a detailed set of controls including education, income, risk preferences, self-reported health, financial confidence, and optimism.====In what follows, we first briefly describe the Singaporean pension system, followed by an overview of our dataset. Next, we report our empirical findings, and we close with a discussion and conclusions.",Trust and retirement preparedness: Evidence from Singapore,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300487,21 September 2020,2020,Research Article,76.0

Older workers may want to delay retirement to ==== their prolonged lives, but job markets are not favorable for them. A hike in pension benefits might increase individual financial security, but weaken pension stability. Using panel data for older workers in Korea – a typical fast-aging middle-income country with a high rate of elderly poverty – this study finds that the forward-looking incentive measures associated with the public pension have a statistically significant effect on retirement probability. Older wage workers are more responsive to utility gains from continued work due to additional earnings and increased pension benefits than to financial gains from greater pension ","Labor market participation among older workers is affected by many variables. Previous studies of developed countries show that the social security system can have a significant effect on retirement, leading to a sharp decline in their labor force participation rate (LFPR) at eligibility ages (Blau and Goodstein, 2010, Blöndal and Scarpetta, 1999, Gruber and Wise, 2004).====Will this trend repeat in middle-income countries as their public pension systems mature? Many of these countries have seen their populations age rapidly due to low fertility rates and higher life expectancy. This places financial pressures on pension systems, and, combined with the prospect of decreasing family support, also adds to the risk of elderly poverty. If public support is not adequate for financing retirement, older workers may have an incentive to remain in the labor market. Yet the labor market in these countries is not favorable to older wage workers. This will pose a serious policy challenge for policies seeking to maintain pension stability and minimize elderly poverty.====A case in point is the Republic of Korea (South Korea). With low fertility rates and higher life expectancy, it is currently the fastest aging country among all OECD members. Its old-age dependency ratio - the number of individuals aged 65 and over per 100 people of working age - increased from 11.2 percent in 2000 to 20.2 percent in 2016 and is projected to reach 31.7 percent in 2025 (OECD, 2017). South Korea also has the highest poverty and suicide rates among the elderly in OECD countries.==== Financial concerns among older workers are reflected in their retirement behavior. While the official retirement age (i.e. age eligible for public pension benefits) is from 60 to 65, depending on birth cohort, the effective labor market exit age==== was 72 in 2016, reflecting the high share of older workers who are self-employed or still in the labor force. This is much higher than the OECD average of 65.1 and the U.S. average of 66.8 (OECD, 2017). Given that the labor market exit age resembles the pension eligibility age for most OECD countries, it appears that the elderly population in Korea needs to work longer to ensure financial stability in retirement.====The Korean government faces several policy challenges here. To address elderly poverty, it needs to strengthen public support and safety-nets for the elderly. Its largest social security system, The National Pension Service (NPS), was created in 1988 and achieved universal coverage in 1999. Its fund balance, however, will become exhausted as the number of beneficiaries increases, indicating a need for reform. Making the tax-benefit scheme more sustainable requires knowing the retirement incentives associated with the current system.====Many other middle-income countries with developing social security systems will face similar problems. Their benefit levels may not be as sufficient as those of rich countries, thereby posing policy challenges regarding the welfare of the elderly and the labor market structure. If older wage workers wish to work more so as to better prepare for retirement, tension may arise with young job seekers in a tight job market. Some older workers may have to go into self-employment as a second-best choice, adding to the already high share of the self-employed in their labor markets. For older self-employed workers, who tend to be relatively poor on average, enforcement of public pension is not easy.==== In addition, family support that used to be an essential source of retirement financing has been dwindling in many Asian countries. While there are many cultural contributors to this phenomenon, sharply declining fertility rates have been a critical cause of reduced support by children.====This study aims to contribute to the literature by providing evidence on retirement incentives of the social security system in Korea, a typical fast-aging middle-income country. Due to the relatively short history of the government pension program and the lack of reliable data containing sufficient information on older adults, studies on the retirement incentives of Korea’s main social security program have been limited. Using six waves (2006–2016) of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLoSA) dataset, a relatively new database with individual-level data for those aged 45 and over, we estimate the incentive effects of the NPS on the retirement behavior of male workers. To compare the Korean pension situation with that in other countries, we assess measures of the expected pension benefit and other incentive variables (i.e. accrual, peak value, and option value) that have been used in previous cross-country comparison studies (Gruber and Wise, 2004, Stock and Wise, 1990).====Our estimation results show that retirement incentives inherent in the NPS do have a statistically significant effect on the probability of retirement. Older wage workers are more responsive to utility gains from continued work due to additional earnings and increased pension benefits than to financial gains from greater pension wealth. Furthermore, the level of pension benefits is not statistically significant when controlling for financial and labor market characteristics. This may indicate that older workers perceive social security benefits alone as insufficient for financing their later life. Relatedly, supplementary income variables such as transfers from children and government income support for retirees do have statistically significant effects on retirement. All this suggests there will be increasing pressures on the public pension system in fast-aging middle-income countries as low fertility rates lead to fewer children being able to support their parents, and as the number of pension recipients and the total pension benefits paid per person increases with life expectancy.====The following section provides a literature review and background information on Korea’s national pension program.

Increased longevity may compromise public budgets’ sustainability due to the growing expenditures with health services and social security. It may also affect labor market dynamics and influence savings’ behavior, leading to lower equilibrium interest rates and more restricted monetary policy interventions’ space. Yet, consumers and entrepreneurs become more risk-averse as life expectancy grows, which may reduce the volatility of consumption and investment. This paper aims at verifying if population aging promotes or hinders macroeconomic stability. Using data from 146 economies between 1996 and 2016, static and dynamic panel data models were estimated controlling for other factors that affect short-run macroeconomic performance. The results indicate that countries with an aging population exhibit lower consumption and investment volatility, but output volatility seems to increase as the population grows older likely due to the labor market responses to aging and greater international trade volatility.","Population aging is no longer a trend restricted to developed countries. Scientific advances and improved access to health care services have contributed to the growth in longevity, while greater participation of women in labor markets has led to lower fertility rates (Yoon et al., 2014, Aiyar et al., 2016, Eggertsson, 2018). The rise in old-age dependency ratios has been blamed for relevant changes in several countries’ macroeconomic performance, particularly in more advanced economies====.====The age composition of a country influences the demand for goods, services, and financial assets, affects the labor-force productivity, overwhelms public finances, and alters credit markets’ dynamics. Although a large literature has focused on the effects of population aging on economic growth, only recently the discussions also started to consider the link between the growth in longevity and business cycles volatility.====The impact of demographic changes on short-run macroeconomic stability is ambiguous. On one hand, economic agents’ degree of risk aversion tends to increase as life expectancy grows. The prevalence of a more cautious behavior promotes greater consumption smoothing, increases savings, lowers equilibrium interest rates, and spurs investments in low-risk endeavors. All these factors contribute to lessening consumption and investment short-run volatility.====On the other hand, the fiscal burden caused by the increase in longevity may hinder the use of fiscal policy to promote macroeconomic stability. The impact of population aging is particularly severe in emerging economies, where governments face greater public budget financing restrictions. Additionally, as economic agents grow older, their marginal propensity to consume tends to fall, which lowers the fiscal multiplier and further compromises the efficacy of fiscal policy====.====Population aging may also lead to greater business cycles volatility because of its impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy interventions and on financial markets’ stability. As longevity increases and savings grow, the equilibrium interest rates may drop to levels near the zero lower bound, hindering the central bank’s ability to stimulate the economic activity at the onset of a financial crisis. Moreover, the growth in savings may be destabilizing if competition for these resources leads to increased risk-taking behavior by financial institutions. Additionally, as pension funds and other institutional investors gain a more prominent role, their synchronized behavior increases the financial sector’s exposure to systemic risk, and their global reach may raise the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks.====Finally, the increase in longevity may also contribute to greater macroeconomic volatility as aging individuals have lower productivity and face greater barriers to getting rehired after a recession. As a result, business cycles’ volatility grows, and economic recoveries tend to be sluggish.====The present article evaluates the impacts of population aging on short-run macroeconomic performance. The paper attempts to verify whether the conservative behavior of older economic agents towards risk leads to lower cyclical volatility of consumption and investment and neutralizes the possible destabilizing effects of aging on labor markets’ dynamics and on the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies.====According to Bean (2004) and Fujita and Fujiwara (2015), demographic changes occur at a slow pace, and their short-run impact on economic activity is deemed negligible. In order to take this restriction into account, the empirical strategy adopted in the present paper involved using data from 146 countries between 1996 and 2016. The time series component of the panel dataset was transformed from yearly data into five groups of four-year intervals, which allows that demographic changes are better accounted for. Thus, the transformed dataset has five observations for each of its 146 cross-section units.====The literature which analyzes the impact of aging on business cycles volatility has mostly aimed at developing life-cycle or dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models and at presenting empirical evidence on the link between longevity and short-run macroeconomic performance using microeconomic data (Wong, 2016, Fujita and Fujiwara, 2015; Heer et al., 2017, Sudo and Takizuka, 2018, Jones, 2018). To the best of our knowledge, no other study has attempted to evaluate the impact of aging on business cycles volatility using such an ample group of countries. Jaimovich and Siu (2009), for instance, used a dataset with only seven countries to verify the impact of aging on macroeconomic performance, and their focus was solely on the labor market dynamics. Aksoy et al (2019) in turn used a vector autoregressive panel dataset of 21 OECD countries to assess the long-run impacts of population aging.====The results presented here reveal that increases in longevity lead to lower cyclical volatility in consumption and investment, but greater volatility in production. Because separate variables accounted for the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies, this puzzling outcome may arise if changes in labor market dynamics due to aging overshadow the stabilizing effects of changes in economic agents’ risk-behavior. Yet, additional estimations show that (i) a robust positive link between population aging and employment volatility only occurs in a few of the regression settings; and (ii) international trade volatility emerges as an important channel through which population aging leads to greater output volatility. Finally, the results also indicate the existence of a non-linear relationship between population aging and the volatility of consumption and investment: volatility is higher when the population is very young or very old but falls when the fraction of the population in their middle-ages is large, an outcome previously reported by Jaimovich e Siu (2009).====Assessing the importance of population aging to short-run macroeconomic performance is relevant because several countries have been displaying this demographic trend over the last decade. Some authors have even suggested that the severity and lasting effects of the Great Recession are partly due to the growth in longevity (Stock and Watson, 2012, Jones, 2018). Thus, identifying the link between population aging and business cycles may guide fiscal and monetary policies’ interventions, as well as labor market initiatives to ease the burden of economic slowdowns.====Besides this introduction, the paper has five more sections. The second section presents the literature which explores the link between aging and short-run macroeconomic stability. The third section details the data and the empirical strategy, while the fourth section analyzes the estimations’ results.

The analysis is based on a law change to the benefit rules which occurred in Spain in July 2012, when the eligible age for an extended benefit to older workers was raised from 52 to 55, and on data from the administrative records of the Spanish Public Employment Service. We analyse empirically the changes in the age pattern of inflows intro unemployment insurance before and after the reform, on the one hand, and the effect of the legal change on the age at the date of unemployment benefit admission, on the other hand. Our findings suggest that reducing the potential benefits duration affects the pattern of admissions, transferring entries to higher ages, and that the age at which older workers begin to receive unemployment insurance benefits increases by between one and three months for certain categories of workers.","Academics who investigate the impact of reforms on the generosity of unemployment compensation systems (UCS) focus their attention almost exclusively on the effects of the level and duration of unemployment benefits on the numbers exiting from receipt of benefits. However, the UCS can affect not only the exits from benefit recipiency and its duration, but also the inflows into recipiency. Both transitions are important in explaining aggregate unemployment rates. In fact, some works stress that changes in unemployment inflows are responsible for much of the change in unemployment rates (see Burgess and Turon, 2005, Lalive et al., 2011). Strangely enough, the impact of unemployment benefits (and more specifically, unemployment insurance -UI- benefits) on unemployment entry has been rarely studied. In contrast to outflow effects, empirical evidence on the impact of benefit generosity on the unemployment inflow is scarcer. This paper contributes to filling this gap in the literature by examining how a law change for older workers (that modified the potential duration of their benefits) affected the inflows into UI.====The UCS may affect unemployment via a higher inflow into unemployment. In the equilibrium search model with an endogenous job destruction rate, idiosyncratic shocks to workers’ productivities make firms’ optimal layoff rule depend on the wage rate, which in turn is affected by the prevailing UI benefits (Mortensen and Pissarides, 1999). If the UI becomes more generous, newly established jobs become unprofitable more quickly, leading to an increase in the steady state flow from employment to unemployment. Likewise, UI benefits that are more generous might affect the behaviour of employers and workers, inducing separations, leading to individuals claiming UI and influencing the timing of layoffs. Implicit contract theory allows to examine the incentives for employers to change their hiring and firing decisions as a result of changes in the generosity of the UI, attempting to remodel (temporary) layoffs, concentrating on the worker–firm relationship as an implicit contract and focusing on the potentially collusive behaviour of employees and employers when faced with uncertain fluctuating product demand (Feldstein, 1976, Topel, 1983, Burdett and Wright, 1989).====This behaviour may affect older workers more intensely, if they can take advantage from extended entitlement periods of UI and/or tailored early retirement schemes, so that unemployment-related benefits effectively provide a pathway to early withdrawal from the labour market, such as the measures devised by many European countries to reduce the effective supply of labour during the 1980s (Duval, 2003). Given these favourable terms, there are strong incentives for older workers dismissed before eligibility for a full pension to draw benefits and use the UCS as a pathway to retirement, especially those employed by companies with many older workers or firms facing economic difficulties. At the same time, for these firms, dismissing older workers first might appear more socially acceptable than placing the burden of job loss on other employees. There might even be a coincidence between the interests of employers, who wanted to reduce a costly segment of their workforce while avoiding social conflict, and the interests of older employees, who were keen to stop working before the legal retirement age.====The role of the UCS in the inflow into UI has been largely forgotten, or at least underestimated, and its statistical importance (especially for older workers) has not been well assessed. Yet, UCS rules and their changes may affect the incentives of employers and employees, influencing layoff decisions and their timing. In this piece of research, we test the hypothesis that changes in the generosity of the UCS (the potential benefits duration, PBD) influence the entry of older workers into UI. If this is the case, it should be visible empirically: the age at which older workers may start drawing benefits should be consistent with the PBD in such a way to enable them to bridge the gap until eligible for full pension. Therefore, changing PBD should affect the age at which older workers begin to receive UI.====Our analysis is based on a law change in benefit rules which occurred in Spain in July 2012. Until then, the unemployed who turned 52 during their PBD, having contributed to the Social Security for the risk of unemployment for at least six years during their working life and fulfilling all the conditions (except the age) for receiving a Social Security pension, were allowed to collect unemployment benefits (UI, unemployment insurance, and/or UA, unemployment assistance, UA) up to the moment they become eligible for a normal old-age pension (65 years). These terms changed in 2012, when the age to become eligible for the extended benefits of older workers was raised from 52 to 55. This reform reduced the unlimited potential entitlement period by three years for the group of individuals aged 52–54 years at the time of job loss, providing an ideal setting for a quasi-experimental evaluation of the influence of potential benefit duration on the inflow into UB. There are two dimensions to be identified: eligibility (age) and time (before and after the law change). The data used come from the (universal) administrative records of the Spanish Public Employment Service (PES), the agency in charge of UBs, which provides information about changes in unemployment benefits over the period 2007–2017. This database enables us to study in detail the age pattern of inflow into UI.====The analysis carried out in this paper is of general interest for several reasons. First, it provides new evidence on the impact of UCS parameters on inflow into UI, a subject that has been studied substantially less than outflow in the literature on UCS, with a small amount of studies investigating unemployment entry effects arising from increased/reduced benefit duration. Second, it contributes to the literature on the interaction between institutions (in this case, the UCS and the pension system) in shaping the behaviour of employers and employees.====Third, the article examines an issue that is useful for public policy, since it highlights the role of UCS rules in explaining the level of participation in the labour force of older workers. Since many countries are debating (or have already implemented) reforms that reduce the generosity of early retirement schemes with the goal of increasing the employment rates of older workers, Spain is an interesting case study because these schemes were heavily used to mitigate labour market problems over the past decades (since the 1980s, when unemployment rates sky-rocketed and remained high for many years). While the Spanish early retirement system created particularly large incentives, the scheme is similar to those of other European countries. Therefore, our results may illustrate mechanisms of policies that are at work (or under debate) in many countries.====Lastly, the richness of the administrative dataset used makes it possible to identify the factors at work and highlights not only the entitlement effect but also the importance of the distance to retirement as response types of behaviour to UCS rules. While the former corresponds to a propensity of the parties to a labour relationship (firms and workers) to schedule job termination so that the employee gains access to longer PBD, the latter concerns the tendency to schedule separations so that workers can receive unemployment benefits until they are eligible for a full pension. As our dataset allows to identify accessions to UI by cause of entry, we can add to the literature on that point.====The structure of the article is as follows. Section “====” reviews the empirical literature on the effects of PBD on entries into UI benefits. Section “Institutional setting: the UCS and the 2012 labour reform” provides a description of the UCS regulations in Spain and the law changes adopted in 2012. Section “Data and descriptive statistics” presents the administrative data and some descriptive statistics. Section 5 provides an econometric analysis of the effect of the legal change on the pattern of UI inflow before and after the reform (a “density analysis”, where the dependent variable is the number of beneficiaries) and on the age of unemployed workers at admission into UI (an “age analysis”, where the dependent variable is age), followed by several robustness checks. Finally, Section “Conclusions” concludes.",Does unemployment benefit duration affect inflows into unemployment?

After accounting for the corresponding conditions in adulthood, we find that both higher childhood socioeconomic status and cognition (especially mathematical ability) are strongly and positively associated with owning risky financial assets, a house, as well as with one’s willingness to take financial risks. In stark contrast, having had health problems in early life negatively affects only homeownership in older age. Finally, favorable childhood conditions are also positively associated with the transition in and out of risky asset ownership several decades later, both by facilitating investing and making divesting less likely.","Why do so very few households invest in risky assets? This puzzle has been preoccupying economists for many years (see e.g. Haliassos and Bertaut, 1995, Guiso et al., 2001), with the overwhelming majority of potential explanations related to adulthood. We propose to study this problem from a new angle that has not yet been explored in the literature.==== Specifically, we go back in time and examine the effect of childhood conditions on both risky asset choice and risk preferences in older age. To do so, we use micro-survey data that provide both current and retrospective information on a representative sample of people aged 50+ in 11 European countries, with a focus on several childhood indicators related to early cognition, socioeconomic status (SES) and health. The data also contain information on asset choices and risk attitudes at the time of the survey, and thus we can examine how the latter are linked to early life conditions.====We find that risky asset ownership in older age, as well as the willingness to take any financial risks, are strongly and positively associated with childhood SES and cognition. In contrast, the effect of health problems early in life is considerably weaker. Importantly, these results are obtained after controlling for SES, cognition and health status in adulthood, namely by including in our empirical specifications variables such education, wealth, income, and health conditions. Ours is thus evidence for the existence of direct and longstanding (possibly permanent) effects of childhood conditions on economic choices and attitudes later in life, above and beyond their adulthood-related causes. We also further extend the literature on portfolio allocation by estimating the transition probabilities in and out of ownership for different financial assets. Our findings indicate that higher childhood SES and cognition make it less likely for households to sell their risky assets, and more likely to invest in them if they don’t already own them.====There are several channels through which childhood experiences may affect financial decisions in adulthood. First, childhood conditions have direct implications for wealth later in life, which is in turn strongly associated with risky asset ownership. Oftentimes, an early life of deprivation has a negative effect on childhood health. Poor childhood health adversely affects cognition and wealth accumulation in adulthood, thus leading to the perpetuation of poverty (Palloni, 2006), the persistence of which across generations is well documented.==== More generally, there is ample evidence that the intergenerational correlation in incomes and income volatility is high (Solon, 1992, Shore, 2011). The same is true for the intergenerational correlation in wealth, as documented by Charles and Hurst (2003), who also find that adults who have wealthy living parents are more likely to invest in risky assets like stocks.====Second, childhood conditions affect individuals’ stock of human capital. The benefits of positive early childhood experiences (as indicated by height) extend to the old age, as taller individuals enjoy better physical and mental health in later life (Case and Paxson, 2008). Furthermore, using height as a marker for lifelong experiences, Korniotis and Kumar (2010) find that taller individuals are more likely to participate in financial markets, and when they do so, they also hold riskier financial portfolios. Case et al. (2005) in turn find that being born in a low SES family has a negative impact on childhood health, lowers investments in human capital and worsens health in early adulthood, all effects associated with lower adult earnings (see also Hanushek and Woessmann (2008) for a survey of the voluminous evidence on the strong positive association between childhood cognition and adult earnings). Hence, health and cognitive problems in childhood are likely to put people at a disadvantage when they start their working lives. With diminished human capital, individuals will likely experience a lower lifetime income, with direct implications for portfolio choice.====Third, early life experiences may affect portfolio choice by shaping attitudes toward risk. For instance, a difficult childhood may lead to higher risk aversion in adulthood. Results from Hryshko et al. (2011) suggest that attitudes such as risk aversion are partly shaped by childhood SES. They find that besides age, gender, religion, and parents’ risk aversion, a higher level of parental education makes children less risk averse in adulthood, which should lead to riskier portfolio allocations.====Fourth, childhood conditions may affect the rate of return of capital. For example, early cognitive skills are likely to have a direct impact on the level of financial sophistication later in life. Indeed, Lusardi et al. (2010) find that the financial literacy of young adults in the US is strongly positively associated with their test scores in high school, as well as with their parents’ wealth. Furthermore, household finance literature has long recognized that financial sophistication affects saving and portfolio decisions (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007; Behrman et al., 2012, Lusardi et al., 2017), with Van Rooij et al. (2011) showing financial literacy to correlate with higher chances to invest in the stock market and with greater wealth. Calvet et al. (2009) construct an index of financial sophistication and show that poor financial sophistication explains a rich set of investment mistakes, which include under-diversification, inertia in risky shares of one’s portfolio, and the tendency to sell winning stocks and hold losing ones.====Fifth, childhood conditions may affect the type of uncertainties that an individual will have to face during adulthood. Having certain medical conditions early in life can lower life expectancy and lead to higher and more volatile health spending. Additionally, low cognitive abilities and childhood SES can reduce the chances of finding and keeping a job, thus leading to a less stable working life trajectory. In fact, Brandt and Hank (2011), using the same data as we do, find a strong positive association of childhood SES and health with income uncertainty in adulthood, as indicated by the prevalence of unemployment spells. As a result, higher exposure to risk in one dimension may lead people to reduce risks in other dimensions, for instance by increasing saving for precautionary reasons or by diminishing investments in risky assets like stocks. Empirical evidence for the former effect was provided by Carroll and Samwick (1997), who showed that people exposed to higher income insecurity systematically accumulate more wealth. Moreover, Guiso et al., 1996, Heaton and Lucas, 2000 find that when other independent risks are present, investors drop their exposure to rate-of-return risks, lowering the share of wealth in illiquid and risky assets (especially stocks).====In recent years, several studies have focused on the effects of education and cognition on stock market participation. In the U.S for instance, Cole et al. (2014) find that education has large causal effects on financial participation and smaller effects on a households’ finance management (as indicated by credit scores, bankruptcy, and foreclosure). The study also uses within-sibling variation in cognitive ability to highlight the importance of cognition for sound financial decision-making. In this context, however, using investment or retirement income as proxy for market participation is only partially informative about one’s amount and type of investments. Conversely, Hryshko et al. (2012) use PSID data on direct risky assets ownership and find that education has a positive impact on the joint propensity to own stocks and mutual funds (outside of retirement accounts). Grinblatt et al. (2011) study the Finnish stock market participation as a function of IQ measured at age 19 or 20. They conclude that all IQ subcomponents (logical, verbal, and especially mathematical scores) have a significant impact on stock or mutual fund ownership later in life, with the economic effect of IQ being even larger than income’s participation effect. Finally, Christelis et al. (2010) find the propensity to invest in stocks to be strongly related with cognitive abilities in older age.====Our paper contributes to the literature on financial risk-taking in several dimensions. First, it examines the effect of cognition in childhood (at age 10) on financial risk-taking, ==== of the corresponding effect of education and adulthood cognition. Second, it highlights the influence of childhood SES and health on financial risk-taking, ==== of childhood cognition and ==== of any measures of economic resources in adulthood. Third, we provide this evidence for 11 different European countries, using harmonized survey data. Finally, as discussed below, we study the effects of our variables of interest on (i) the static choice of holding risky financial assets, and (ii) the decision to invest in or disinvest from them from one period to the next. Hence, our study sheds light on how our variables of interest affect the dynamics of financial risk taking.====Finally, we note that the link between childhood conditions and financial risk taking has also been briefly touched upon in, Christelis et al. (2011, henceforth CDM). There are several fundamental differences between this study and CDM (e.g., different outcome variables, the examination of asset ownership transitions, etc.). These differences are discussed in detail in Appendix A1.====The structure of the paper is as follows: Section “Data” describes the data, while Section “Methodology” discusses our estimation methodology.

The most direct way to access home equity is downsizing, but few choose this option because they generally prefer to stay in their house. The alternative is withdrawing equity through a reverse mortgage or a property tax deferral, but few households use these options either. While this low take-up has been well documented, a more fundamental question is the extent to which homeowners exhibit sufficient stability in their housing patterns to make them well-suited to tap their equity. For example, if homeowners do tap their equity and then end up moving, they have to pay back the loan with interest, which could leave them with inadequate resources at a vulnerable time in their life. This paper assesses how likely households are to move as they age to see if borrowing against one’s home is a reasonable financial strategy. The analysis uses the ==== (HRS) to analyze three cohorts: the HRS cohort (ages 50–54 in 1992), the AHEAD cohort (ages 70–74 in 1993), and a synthetic cohort covering the whole lifespan from age 50 to death. The analysis identifies typical housing trajectories in retirement and explores how often, and for whom, tapping home equity would be a viable strategy.====The paper found that:====The policy implications of the findings are:","As retirees live longer, spend more on medical care, and get less income replaced by Social Security, many may need to consider tapping their home equity to be comfortable in retirement. They could access their equity most directly by selling the house where they raised their children and purchasing a smaller, less expensive house for their retirement. Such a shift would not only produce a bundle of cash but would also reduce the expenses associated with homeownership. The problem is that most retirees are attached to their homes and want to age in place. For retirees who want to stay put, the only alternative is to borrow against their home. This borrowing could be done through a reverse mortgage or a state property tax deferral program – two mechanisms that allow people to increase their income (or reduce their expenses) while they are alive and pay back the loan with interest when they die or move. Despite the need for additional money in retirement, few households take out a reverse mortgage and homeowners seem resistant to deferring their property taxes. Researchers have explored the reasons for such reluctance and found that homeowners may be put off by the complexity of the product or want to avoid liens on an asset that they plan to leave as a bequest.====A more fundamental issue for policymakers is whether most homeowners are well suited to tap their home equity. For example, despite a general desire to age in place, people may end up moving for various reasons. If those who moved have already tapped their equity, they are forced to pay back the outstanding loans with interest, leaving them with inadequate resources at a vulnerable time in their life. The question is to what extent are homeownership patterns stable enough to tap home equity? To address this question, this paper assesses how likely people are to move as they age and identifies the characteristics of these movers to see if borrowing against one’s home is a viable financial strategy.====The discussion proceeds as follows. The first section describes what we know about the products available for tapping home equity, the preferences of households, and moving patterns. The second section describes the data from the Health and Retirement Study used for the analysis, the methodology for creating a “synthetic cohort” of 50–54 year olds that can be observed until death, and a relatively new technique – sequence analysis – that can be applied to cohorts of households to uncover and group together common housing trajectories. The third section reports the results of applying sequence analysis to the HRS cohort who were 50–54 in 1992 and the AHEAD cohort who were 70–74 in 1993, as well as the synthetic cohort. Once groups with stable and unstable patterns have been identified, the fourth section reports on the characteristics of the homeowners who fit each pattern, information that could help policymakers assess who is best suited for tapping home equity. The final section concludes that most homeowners either stay in the home they own in their 50 s or in a new home they purchase around retirement and therefore experience enough residential stability to tap home equity through products and programs like reverse mortgages and property tax deferrals.",Are homeownership patterns stable enough to tap home equity?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300426,15 July 2020,2020,Research Article,84.0

Among the implications, the most important consideration is the savings-driven economic growth and the sustainability of the pension system. The former affects economic growth, and the latter impacts on society's stability.====China has been experiencing rapid economic growth, based on the World Bank data, the country’s average annual GDP growth reached 9.9 percent between 1979 and 2010.==== China’s extraordinary economic boom is accompanied by an impressive expansion of urbanization. In 2000, only 35.9 percent of people in China lived in urban areas. By 2016, the urban share of the population grew to 57 percent.==== The household structure has also changed due to increasing urbanization. Household size shrank as more people moved to urban areas. According to census estimates, the average household size fell from 3.44 in 2000 to 3.10 in 2010.==== Average household size declined nearly everywhere in the world in the past three decades, while the co-residence of children and older persons is still common in China nowadays (UN, 2017). However, some reverse trend in household composition has been observed. With China’s economic influence, the impact of household structure on household consumption in China can have implications not just in the country but also to the rest of the world.====The effort of incorporating the different needs of people at different ages into the dependency ratio goes back to Cutler et al. (1990). The authors observed that people younger than 20 years old spend more on education than people in other age groups ($2553 against $309 in 1989 dollars), while people who are 65 years old and over spend more on health than those under 64 ($5360 against $1262). In generating the “support ratio“, Cutler et al. (1990) constructed a needs-weighted consumption measure, where the number of people under age 20 was adjusted by multiplying it by 0.72, while the number of people above 65 was multiplied by 1.27. Weil (1999) also used these factors to incorporate the relative needs of the young and old in determining the optimal fertility rate and population growth that maximize consumption. Prskawetz and Sambt (2014) extended the approach of Cutler et al. (1990) by disaggregating the population into more age groups and constructing and/or comparing the economic support ratios in the European countries using the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) data.====Another line of analysis on the relationship between age and consumption is based on the life cycle theory that allows consumption to vary across age. Kniesner et al. (2006) pointed out that if there is a life cycle plan to defer consumption at a later age, the value of the life==== of the elderly would be higher than that of the young. Using the Norwegian quarterly time series data on the aggregated level, Erlandsen and Nymoen (2008) empirically documented that the age distribution of the population has significant and life-cycle consistent effects on aggregate consumption. Alessie and de Ree (2009) found a hump-shaped (log) household income, and durable and nondurable consumption over the life (or age) profiles of Dutch households.====The notion of “equivalence scale” that is popularized in poverty assessment shares similarities with our efforts to reflect the economic needs of people at different ages. The equivalence scale proposed by Deaton (1997) incorporates the household composition when measuring consumption per capita by including both the effect of “economies of scale” and “different needs of people at a different age.“ In contrast to our framework, their focus is on a welfare measure reflected by the share of food consumption rather than absolute consumption expenditure. Also, they did not introduce the role of productivity (income) in their framework.====Previous studies are mainly focused on age-specific consumption through the perspective of the life cycle framework. Although there is an extensive literature that uses the NTA approach with micro data used—for example, Mason et al., 2006, UN, 2013, and Barslund and von Werder (2016)—the structure of the household (co-residency style) at the micro level are mostly ignored. For example, elderly people who live alone might exhibit different consumption patterns compared to their peers who live with their offspring. With changes in household composition, household consumption should change accordingly. On medical expenditure, past studies mostly examine whether the expenses rise along with age or the expenses are mainly incurred during the last years of life. Using the 1983–1992 longitudinal data of deceased Swiss individuals, Zweifel et al. (1999) found that health care expenditures are primarily spent in the last two years of life. Using a 29-year longitudinal English dataset, Seshamani and Gray (2004) drew similar conclusions: a tenfold increase in costs from five years before death to the last year of life overshadows the 30-percent increase in costs from age 65 to 85. Yogo (2016) examined the panel data from the Health and Retirement Study in the United States from 1992 to 2006 and noted that the out-of-pocket health expenditures rise with age for elderly people. However, all these analyses are based on individual-level data rather than accounting for their household structure.====We introduce the household structure to analyze its impact on household regular expenditure and medical expenditures motived by previous research on household consumption/health expenditures and intergeneration living arrangements, which have documented strong evidence in the positive role of the intrahousehold transfer such as family care. Using a social experiment data, Pezzin et al. (1996) concluded that the choice among publicly provided home care and family care depends on the living arrangments, and in turn, the living arrangements choices are influenced by the publicly provided care. Pezzin and Schone (1999) develop and estimate a joint model of informal caregiving and the labor participation decision of the adult daughters. They found the intergeneration coresidence is an important mode of assistance to the elderly people. Hughes and Waite (2002) proposed an alternative theory to explain how household structure affects individual health: individuals have role-based household relationships shaped by the available resources and demands. The perceived imbalance of higher demand than the resources poses risk to individual health. Using waves 1 and 2 of the Health and Retirement Study, for individuals at age of 51–61, they found married couples living alone or with children are the most advantaged while single mothers with children are the least.====Different efforts recently also have been paid to assess population aging in a more sensible way than the traditional dependency-ratio, such as Sanderson and Scherbov (2005), who measured the population aging with a standardized median age of the population, which is to divide the median age by the expected remaining years of life. Such measures incorporate the population dynamics, such as longer life expectancy, into the measurement of aging. An implied assumption in this measurement is that with longer life expectancy, people can work and generate income at an older age as the same rate as their former cohort with a shorter life expectancy at a younger age did.====Different from Cutler et al., 1990, Weil, 1999, and Prskawetz and Sambt (2014), we estimate the factor of relative needs of people at different ages based on a regression model, which differentiates household composition. Different from Sanderson and Scherbov (2005), our approach provides an alternative way to measure aging by taking into account the income generating capability directly.====We are also related to the literature on the marginal propensity to consume. The recent focus of this line of literature is paid more on examining the relationship between the propensity to consume and the income or wealth level of the individuals. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data 1999–2013, Fisher et al. (2018) found that the average marginal propensity to consume for the United States is 0.1 as 0.15 for the lowest income quintile and 0.06 for the highest income quintile. Badura et al. (2017) documented the negative relationship between the marginal propensity to consume and the relative income using data for Shanghai from 2000 to 2014. The range of their reported marginal propensity to consume is from 0.6 to 0.9. While Zhang et al. (2018) analyze saving behaviors of Chinese households using Chinese Household Income Project 2013 data, they documented the top earners saving rate is close to 0.5 while the bottom income households save rate is 0.2, which is equivalent to a marginal propensity to consume from 0.5 to 0.8. Our analysis cannot yield directly the marginal propensity to consume because our analysis is based on household income and consumption rather than income and consumption per capita. Additionally, the implied assumption in our analysis is that individuals in different age cohorts have different marginal propensity to consume, which is one of the reasons that not only the size of the household but also the structure of the household affect the consumption.====We apply the same modeling framework to examine how the household composition affects the medical expenditure and re-examine whether there is a linear relationship between age and medical expenditure among the elderly members.====Building on the proposed modeling framework and utilizing the 2011 Chinese Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data, we found that the consumption- and productivity- adjusted dependency ratio (both total and old-age dependency ratios) were consistently lower than the one that is traditionally defined.====The commonly discussed cost-saving impact works through two channels: The first is “scale-of-economy” impact by sharing the common cost in the household by the family members; the second is the intrahousehold transfer – family caring provided by the middle-age member to the elderly members, better risk-sharing by the coresidence, and child-caring provided freely by the elder members to the young members. Through the intrahousehold transfer channels, we expected to have the following findings.====For the regular consumption expenditure, the elderly members consumed much less than the young or middle-aged members. The relatively younger elderly members between 65 and 72 years old reduced the consumption expenditure of the young members in their households, while the elderly members who lived alone consumed more than their counterparts who lived with their offspring.====For medical expenditure, on the contrary, the elderly members, especially those elderly individuals who lived alone, spent more on than the young and the middle-aged members. One interesting pattern we observed from the data is that, by distinguishing the cut-off age between the younger elderly and the older elderly members and controlling household income and household structures, the medical expenditure of the elderly exhibited an inverted-U shape relationship with age. Medical expenditures are mostly spent on individuals between 55 and 65 years old. After 65 years of age, especially after 78 years old, medical expenditure started to decline. We also found that in China, higher household income reduced rather than increased medical expenditure significantly.====In our analysis, we do not rule out the possibility of wealthier members tend t live alone. Similar patterns were observed by Pezzin et al. (1996) that a generous public home care program significantly reduces the probability of living in shared households. Since in the survey we do not have the pension reported, we cannot separately measure the income of the elderly members in a shared household. Therefore we cannot check statistically whether the income of the elder people who live alone is significantly higher than those living with their off-springs. However, since the purpose of our analysis is to check whether there is a cost-saving effect when elderly members live with the younger members, the fact that wealthier people tend to live alone, do support our argument.====Our data has its caveats. First, we used a cross-sectional dataset, which cannot capture the cohort effect straightforwardly. Second, health status is not explicitly defined in the analysis of health expenditure. The measurement of health status is conditional on the health status distribution embedded in the data. However, had the health status been included, it should enhance the pattern found in the analysis, because we expect older people to have worse health status on the average, which should cause an increase in medical cost rather than a reduction. Third, our data might not be adequate to address the issue on the rising medical cost when approaching death. Nevertheless, despite these caveats, the evidence showing that the household structure plays an important role in determining regular consumption expenditure and medical expenditure cannot be overlooked.====Additionally, in our household survey data, we do not have social transfer items included. We do include household members who are retired. However, their pensions were not reported and therefore not included as part of the household income. If the saved pension being invested, the return is included in the income. Although we do not have the pension amount reported, we have the share of elder members who are having a pension. The pensioner accounts for 40.4% (1297/3210) in the elder members who are 65 and above years old. Therefore, social transfer plays a role implicitly in our analysis.====Section “Consumption- and productivity-adjusted dependency ratio” sets up a linear regression model and deduces the equivalent needs of population members at different ages.

If, for instance, an active work life is beneficial for the health of the elderly, policies aiming at delaying retirement could potentially improve health and reduce medical expenses. In order to inform the policy debate of such possible health externalities, knowledge of how retirement causally affects health is critical.====Investigations of the relationship between retirement and health have increased in the two decades since the seminal study of Kerkhofs and Lindeboom (1997) along with a growing interest in the effects of policies that delay retirement.==== However, there remains no unified view of the impact of retirement on various health outcomes, with some studies concluding that retirement has a positive influence on health (both mental and physical) and others stating that retirement has a negative or null effect. Investigating the reasons for these differing results can help us to better understand the relationship between retirement and health. A survey of the literature on this topic by Nishimura et al. (2018) finds that differences in estimation methods and country-specific contexts are the main drivers of heterogeneous results across studies.====Another key aspect to understanding these differences is a better grasp of the mechanisms through which retirement influences health outcomes and health investment behaviors (i.e., health lifestyle). This research question has been first tackled by Eibich (2015) using German data, and subsequently by Motegi et al., 2016, Kämpfen and Maurer, 2016, Ayyagari, 2016, Zhu, 2016, Celidoni and Rebba, 2017, Zhao et al., 2017, Bertoni et al., 2018, Kesavayuth et al., 2018, Binh Tran and Zikos, 2019.==== ==== However, since most studies consider a specific country and estimation methods are often different, findings are difficult to compare and/or to generalize, and sometimes lead to opposite conclusions. Insler (2014) finds that retirees decrease smoking after retirement, while Ayyagari (2016) estimates that retirement increases the probability of smoking among ever smokers even though they both used the same U.S. Health and Retirement Study data. In view of the existing literature, cross-country studies using harmonized data and identical estimation methods may offer a valuable contribution to better assess the effect of retirement on health.====In this study, we take on this task and examine the effect of retirement on health behaviors in seven major developed countries. To avoid confounding heterogeneity in cross-country findings with differences in data and estimation methods, we use harmonized data, and adopt identical variable definitions, sample restrictions, and methodology for each country. Specifically, we estimate the effect of retirement on health investment behaviors such as alcohol consumption and smoking by exploiting rich and harmonized longitudinal data on older adults from the U.S., England, Europe, and Japan. Our empirical strategy relies on fixed-effects instrumental variables estimation to deal with the endogeneity of retirement decisions. We use pension eligibility age as an instrumental variable, assuming that financial incentives associated with pension eligibility age affect the retirement decision, but are not directly related to an individual’s health investment behaviors.====In contrast to the literature, most of which consists of single-country studies, we find that the elderly do not uniformly change their health investment behaviors in retirement. Changes in behavior differ across countries not only in magnitude but also in the direction of change, and are also heterogeneous by gender and age. Consequently, we cannot present a single unified view of the effects of retirement on health investment behaviors across countries. It is possible that these differences in behavior may be due to differences in the retirement age across countries, and so we have paid particular attention to the control of age in this study and have adopted a flexible functional form in our estimations. We have been able to replicate the results from previous studies by adjusting the way in which we control for age. An additional finding of this study is a verification of the results of Nishimura et al. (2018), which finds that health outcomes can be improved after retirement in most cases. However, although we find that health outcomes may improve, the heterogeneity of health investment behaviors means that the behaviors themselves are not necessarily good predictors of health in retirement.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in the analysis, and Section 3 explains the estimation methods and identification strategies. Section 4 presents the results and our interpretation, and Section 5 summarizes, draws conclusions, and provides ideas for future research.",Retirement and health investment behaviors: An international comparison,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300323,June 2020,2020,Research Article,87.0

The care responsibilities they take on are often incompatible with working full time, and many unpaid care providers drop out of the labor force altogether. The diminished labor force attachment of unpaid care providers is a problem because time spent outside the labor force is a lost opportunity to build one’s savings for retirement, leaving unpaid care providers, most of whom are women, in vulnerable straits when their time comes to retire. This study analyzes how California’s paid leave policy impacted the labor force participation and part time status of unpaid care providers, allowing for differential impacts by gender, educational attainment and age.====Workers take leave from work for a variety of reasons. A 2012 survey of employees reveals that 18 percent of leaves taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) were for the illness of a spouse, parent or child, and 21 percent were due to a pregnancy or the arrival of a new child (Klerman et al., 2012). California implemented a ==== family leave policy in 2004, which provides workers access to 6 weeks of partially paid leave to care for a newborn or for sick family members. Studies of the effects of California’s paid family leave policy have focused on measuring its impact on young women who take maternity leave. The present study looks at the effect of California’s paid family leave policy on the labor market outcomes of those who provide unpaid care or assistance to a family member or friend who has a long-term illness or a disability.====After 2003, the incidence of caregiving rose in California, driven by a drastic increase among women. This trend was mirrored in the rest of the country, implying it did not occur due to the adoption of paid family leave in California. Moreover, both in California and in the rest of the country, the profile of informal care providers shifted towards older care providers who are Asian or Hispanic, more often having an Associate or a Masters’ degree or better, and more likely to have never married.====Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (Census Bureau, 2016) this study applies a difference-in-difference approach to analyze the impacts of California’s paid family leave policy on the labor force participation rates of those who provide unpaid care, while controlling for the effect of compositional changes in the sample of unpaid care providers. Results suggest that the adoption of paid leave in California is consistent with a 1% increase in the likelihood of being an unpaid care provider in the labor force among women and the higher educated.====The analysis also points to a substantial increase in part time status among unpaid care providers subsequent to the adoption of California’s paid family leave law, but there are not enough observations to estimate this effect controlling for the changing composition of working unpaid care providers.====The next section presents the relevant literature, section 2 describes the data, section 3 conducts a preliminary data analysis of the effect of california’s paid family leave policy, section 4 introduces the model, section 5 analyzes the results, section 6 discusses the results and section 7 concludes.",How does paid family leave affect unpaid care providers?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X2030030X,30 May 2020,2020,Research Article,88.0

We use data from the first three waves of the China Health and Retirement ==== (CHARLS), where participants provided information on Internet use and cognitive function measures at the baseline in 2011 as well as two follow-ups in 2013 and 2015. Cross-lagged panel models were fitted to test the reciprocal association over these four years. Middle-aged and older individuals with higher cognitive function were more likely to be regular Internet users. After controlling for the effects of cognition two years prior, Internet users tended to score higher on cognitive tests than non-users. These findings survived across alternative subsamples and model specifications. Our results suggest that cognitive decline in later life may explain the lower technology adoption rate among older individuals. Meanwhile, Internet use could serve as a protective factor against cognitive decline in mid-life and older adulthood.","The last century has witnessed dramatic technological advances, among which familiarity with the Internet has become a significant determinant of the social connectedness and labor force flexibility of individuals worldwide. As the largest developing country in the world, China’s modernization is accompanied by accelerated adoption of the Internet. As reported by the China Internet Network Information Center, with less than 2% Internet users in 2000, the proportion of individuals using the Internet had increased to 31.8% by 2010, and to 61.2% by 2019. Despite the marked improvement, China is still left behind by the most developed countries. Japan, for instance, has achieved a usage rate of over 90% from 30% in 2000 (World Bank, 2019).====Non-universal Internet use indicates a ‘digital divide’ in China, where specific segments of the population are excluded from using new technologies to improve the quality of life. Among the characteristics documented to be associated with Internet use, age stands out as a vital factor (Gilleard and Higgs, 2008, Wagner et al., 2010). Calculations from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) suggest that about three-quarters of those aged 15 to 44 had used the Internet in 2016, compared to less than one in six people aged 45 and above. Financial constraints due to lower incomes, lack of awareness about the Internet or its benefits, and little prior technology experience are among the many reasons preventing older people from fully adapting to the Internet (Barnard et al., 2013, Carpenter and Buday, 2007, Morris et al., 2007).====Normative health declines impose additional barriers encountered by older adults in using technologies (Charness and Boot, 2009, Hawthorn, 2000, Lee et al., 2011, Matthews et al., 2019). Older adults with physical impairments have more difficulties than do younger people in handling technological devices (Gell et al., 2013, Wright and Hill, 2009). Mental health is also affected by aging. Given the complexity of technologies required to access the Internet, the acquisition of relevant knowledge takes cognitive efforts (Czaja et al., 2006). Cognitive deficits place obstacles to going online, where research has supported the predictive role of declining cognitive abilities in lower rates of Internet use among the elderly (Berner et al., 2013, Berner et al., 2015, Berner et al., 2016, Berner et al., 2019, Charness and Boot, 2009, Czaja et al., 2006, Elliot et al., 2013, Freese et al., 2006, Gell et al., 2013, Kamin and Lang, 2016, Kamin and Lang, 2018, Umemuro, 2004).====For cognitively disadvantaged people, however, the environment shaped by technological developments can be both challenging and stimulating. Participating in cognitively demanding activities, such as learning new skills or knowledge, is protective against age-related cognitive decline (Bielak, 2010, Chan et al., 2016, Park et al., 2014). Meanwhile, the wide variety of services and activities available through the Internet, such as information seeking and interpersonal interaction, facilitate a mentally engaged lifestyle (Kyriazis and Kiourti, 2018, Myhre et al., 2017, Slegers et al., 2012, Small et al., 2009). Therefore, Internet use could help maintain cognitive health in older adulthood (Almeida et al., 2012, Berner et al., 2019, d’Orsi et al., 2018, Kamin and Lang, 2018, Klimova, 2016, Slegers et al., 2012, Tun and Lachman, 2010, Xavier et al., 2014).====Both pathways, cognitive ability predicting Internet use and Internet use mitigating the cognitive decline, are plausible. Nevertheless, cross-sectional studies cannot make reliable inferences concerning the direction of this association. A critical earlier longitudinal study of Kamin and Lang (2018) reported both directions of the Internet-cognition association for European older adults. However, the extent to which these effects can be found in other settings remains an unanswered question. In this study, we utilize a longitudinal sample of middle-aged and older Chinese populations to investigate the reciprocal relationship between Internet use and cognitive function over time.====We add to the literature on Internet use among older adults in the following ways. Firstly, this study sheds light on the bidirectional relationship between Internet use and cognition in the context of China, where the population aging has occurred at a much lower level of Internet penetration than in developed countries. In 2015, around half of the older Europeans were regular Internet users (König et al., 2018), but being online was a minority activity among older people in low and middle-income countries. Secondly, we employ cross-lagged panel models to simultaneously estimate the impacts of two variables on each other over time. Data from a large population-based sample provide us with the statistical power to detect relatively small effects. The current paper’s contribution over Kamin and Lang (2018) lies in the incorporation of latent variables. We focus more on the within-individual process as an attempt to provide evidence for the causal interpretation. Thirdly, we conduct stratified analysis by age, gender, education, and area of residence to explore whether the unequal adoption of digital technologies could exacerbate existing inequalities.",Internet use and cognition among middle-aged and older adults in China: A cross-lagged panel analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X2030027X,12 May 2020,2020,Research Article,89.0

If individuals use pension savings to purchase real estate, they face a trade-off between alleviating borrowing constraints when young and lower liquid retirement means when old. We study the decision to withdraw retirement assets for home purchase in advance by analyzing a recent reform. A change in down payment requirements made such early withdrawals less attractive, as borrowers are obliged to provide a larger amount of non-pension equity for a home purchase. Using individual-level data from a large Swiss ==== provider, we find that the share of individuals who withdrew in a given year dropped by one sixth. For the withdrawers, the average share of pension assets withdrawn decreased by ==== percentage points, mainly driven by individuals with lower levels of pension ==== and of older age. Nonetheless, our analysis also shows that while limiting second pillar withdrawals can aggravate the borrowing constraint to some degree, they are not the only constraining factor when purchasing a home.","We shed some light on the interplay between retirement savings and real estate purchases in the context of a change in regulation in Switzerland. The purchase of real estate can work as a substitute for retirement savings. It may also act as an insurance against fluctuations in rental costs (Sinai and Souleles, 2005). Effectively, when withdrawing pension assets for real estate purchase, individuals face a trade-off between the utility streams of owner-occupied housing and reduced pension assets in the future, along with low portfolio diversification. Due to the special nature of home ownership, the policy maker faces the question whether mandatory retirement savings should be allowed to finance residential property.====Advanced withdrawals of pension assets to purchase owner-occupied housing are possible in countries like Australia, Singapore, or Switzerland. The Central Provident Fund in Singapore allows its insured individuals to make (unlimited) withdrawals for housing since 1968. In Australia, the option to withdraw retirement assets for home ownership was only introduced on July 1, 2018. It allows first home buyers to employ a maximum of AUD 30,000 of voluntary superannuation (paid for with employment-related contributions) to place a deposit on residential property. In Switzerland, withdrawing pension wealth accumulated in the mandatory second pillar for owner-occupied housing has been possible since 1995 (regulated within the Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans). There is no upper limit on withdrawals for individuals below age 50; older individuals can claim the higher amount of either the accumulated wealth at age 50, or half their current accumulated wealth.====Due to the importance of the second pillar in Switzerland, with contribution rates of up to 20%, pension savings account for a large fraction of middle-aged households’ wealth on average, thus making withdrawals attractive. Every third purchase of a home between 2013 and 2017 in Switzerland was partially financed by advance withdrawals at an average amount of CHF 72,000 in 2017 (MoneyPark, 2017). Hence, this policy is an important part of home ownership promotion, which was introduced to the constitution in 1972.====Nevertheless, advance withdrawals have come under scrutiny due to macroeconomic conditions. An exceptionally expansive monetary policy with key interest rates close to zero made property ownership more attractive and pushed up real estate prices. Regulators feared both an overheated property market and an excessive debt burden on households, especially in case of increasing interest rates and falling house prices. As of July 2012, stricter rules for the financing of residential property apply. Households are obliged to provide at least 10% of the property’s value as so-called hard equity, i.e., equity other than pension assets. Previously, it had been possible to finance the required down payment of 20% entirely with accumulated pension wealth from the second pillar. The second change, a requirement to reduce the loan-to-value ratio to a maximum of two thirds within 20 years, basically implemented what had already been common practice before the revision.====Interestingly, the new macro prudential restrictions came in the form of a rule for professional conduct imposed by the Swiss Bankers Association and encouraged by the Swiss National Bank. Such minimum requirements merely provide guidelines for the internal bank procedures that deal with the lending business (Swiss Bankers Association, 2014).====While the aggregate number of advance withdrawals in Switzerland has been on a decreasing trend since 2004 due to decreasing home purchase transaction volumes and rising real estate prices (cf. Fig. 1), there were still around 30,000 withdrawals annually. Around the time of the reform, the aggregate number of withdrawals dropped from more than 25,000 in 2011 to less than 20,000 in 2013, corresponding to a decrease of more than one fifth. It remained at this low level for the rest of the observation period (2013–2015). Therefore, the stricter equity regulation coincided with a non-negligible aggregate effect on the usage of advance withdrawals.====Drawing on administrative data from a large Swiss employer-based pension provider, we explore how the reform influenced withdrawal decisions at the individual level. The pension provider covers employees all over Switzerland and thus approximately 1.1% of the Swiss labor force. The insured individuals tied to this pension provider are representative of the Swiss population. We use the universe of individuals insured by this pension provider in the years just before and just after the reform, namely 2011 and 2013, incorporating information on select socio-economic factors, retirement balances, and advance withdrawals. We investigate whether a policy change in terms of guidelines for minimum requirements is effective along two adjustment margins: the extensive and the intensive margin. We further analyze the characteristics of individuals withdrawing pension assets in advance before and after the reform to uncover the underlying mechanisms at play. Do individuals abstain from a home purchase, postpone their purchase, find other sources of equity or buy a cheaper home in response to the reform?====We observe fewer advance withdrawals after the reform — the individual probability of claiming pension assets drops. The effect of the reform also materializes along the intensive margin: If individuals decide to make a withdrawal, they claim a smaller share of pension assets. As such, changes in access to home ownership have distributional consequences. The share of pension wealth withdrawn after the reform especially dropped for older and lower income individuals. Even after the reform, however, withdrawals play an important role in overcoming liquidity constraints in home purchases. Results suggest that some potential buyers were constrained more by the hard equity requirement after the policy change and less by their pension wealth in financing owner-occupied housing. Our results are neither driven by changes in wages, the unemployment rate, interest rates, nor real estate prices around the reform. In a robustness check examining only foreign residents who should have access to mortgage contracts with foreign banks and thus serve as a control group, we find no effect of the reform.====Our paper relates to three strands of literature. First, early withdrawal of pension wealth is an aspect of portfolio choice in retirement savings. Yogo (2016) shows that housing is the most important tangible asset for the average retiree among four major asset classes (bonds, risky assets, annuities and housing). It serves two purposes: a consumption value from living in the home and a wealth store, which can be left as a bequest or invested to pay for healthcare costs. Considering housing equity as a low-risk investment and underlying insurance provision to buffer long-term care costs, Fehr and Hofmann (2019) find that long-term care risks may be an important driver for home ownership.====Second, our analysis touches on the substitutability between real estate and retirement savings. While we analyze the decision to substitute pension savings with housing equity, most existing literature investigates the possibility to unlock housing wealth as a means of retirement income. Clearly, owner-occupied housing equity has a consumption benefit. Whether the elderly consider downsizing their home equity for general consumption depends on the ratio of income to housing equity and the adequacy of saving for retirement (Venti and Wise, 2004). For countries with declining fertility rates and high life expectancy, e.g., Japan, Mitchell and Piggott (2004) suggest the unlocking of housing wealth assets via reverse mortgages to finance retirement expenditures. The liquidation of housing wealth is especially attractive for “income-poor and house-rich” households (Angelini et al., 2014). In terms of adequacy of retirement saving, home ownership depends on whether housing wealth is considered a substitute for financial wealth to support post-retirement consumption. For US households, Venti and Wise (2004) find that housing equity should not be decumulated to finance non–housing consumption if savings are sufficient to maintain the pre-retirement standard of living.====Finally, our analysis also relates to the annuitization decision at retirement, as advance withdrawals for housing are an anticipated cash out of retirement savings. As demonstrated by Yaari (1965)’s seminal paper, annuities provide sizable utility gains for the individual. In an empirical application, Brown (2001) examines the role of life annuities for insuring against the expenses associated with longevity. Davidoff et al. (2005) find that market incompleteness and liquidity constraints may limit the optimal degree of annuitization to some extent. Moreover, as Bütler and Ramsden (2016) show, differential tax treatments of the lump sum and annuities impact an individual’s cash out decision at retirement. Seemingly, the trade-off between liquidity of means and longevity insurance, as well as most factors influencing annuitization, can also be expected to have a bearing on the withdrawal decision.====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we provide an overview of the institutional setting: the Swiss pension system and promotion of home ownership. Section 3 introduces the dataset and describes the empirical strategy. We present the main results in Section 4, and shed light on the mechanisms at play in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the study.",Building on a pension: Second pillar wealth as a way to finance real estate?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300268,4 May 2020,2020,Research Article,90.0

Differences in life expectancy between high and low socioeconomic groups are often large and have widened recently in many countries. Such longevity gaps affect the actuarial fairness and progressivity of public pension systems. However, behavioral responses to longevity and policy complicate analysis of possible reforms. Here we consider how various pension systems would perform in an OLG setting with heterogeneous longevity and ability. We evaluate ==== of three Notional Defined Contribution plans and three Defined Benefit plans, calibrated on the US case. Compared to a benchmark non-redistributive plan that accounts for differences in mortality, US Social Security reduces regressivity from longevity differences, but would require group-specific life tables to achieve progressivity. Moreover, without separate life tables, despite apparent accounting gains, lower income groups would suffer welfare losses and higher income groups would enjoy welfare gains through indirect effects of pension systems on labor supply.","There are large differences in mortality by socioeconomic status in rich industrial nations and in some developing countries as well, according to a growing literature which has also found that these differences have often widened in recent decades (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 2015, OECD, 2016, Waldron, 2007, Bosworth et al., 2016, Chetty et al., 2016, Rosero-Bixby and Dowosero, 2016, Rostron et al., 2010). While these increasing inequalities in health are themselves an urgent and critically important problem for policy, here we will focus on a different issue: These mortality differences interact with government programs, particularly those for the elderly such as public pensions, health care, and long term care. The economically advantaged groups survive for more years than those with lower income, and thereby receive more costly benefits from each of these programs. Unless tax and contribution structures, on the one hand, and benefit structures on the other, take such differences into account the result can be a net transfer of income from the poor to the rich through these programs. To the extent that programs are designed to be progressive, and intended to redistribute income from rich to poor, these mortality differences will reduce or even reverse the direction of redistribution. Effects of this sort on government programs in the United States were recently quantified and found large (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 2015). For example, the widening of the longevity gap between the top and bottom income quintile in the US raised the present value of lifetime government benefits for the top quintile relative to the bottom by $132,000 for men and by $157,000 for women (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 2015 11). Consequences of this kind are surely present in other countries as well, and have begun to draw broader attention (Ayuso et al., 2017, Holzmann et al., 2020, Lee and Sánchez-Romero, 2020, OECD, 2016).====As populations age, the fiscal sustainability of government programs for the elderly has been increasingly threatened, leading to strong pressures for policy adjustments now and in the near future. Potential policy adjustments, such as raising the Normal Retirement Age for pensions or indexing each generation’s benefit level to its remaining life expectancy, will have different effects on groups with different mortality, effects that will increase if the mortality differences continue to widen. The interactions of mortality differences with policy adjustments were also analyzed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2015) study, for selected program changes.====Analysis of these effects and interactions is far from straightforward, due both to data limitations and to the likelihood of broader behavioral responses by individuals to policies and to their own mortality risks. On the data side, assessments require calculation of taxes and benefits over an entire adult lifetime in relation to mortality differences across an entire lifetime. Since work often starts before age 20, and because many individuals survive past 100, analysis requires longitudinal data for each generation over a span of something like 80 years, disaggregated by socioeconomic status. Such data are seldom if ever available. Empirical studies such as National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2015) have in practice been based on a mixture of observed, simulated and projected data, reflecting many assumptions and introducing many uncertainties, and even after these efforts data on some key variables may be unavailable for parts of the lifecycle.====There are also difficult theoretical issues. Presumably these mortality differences are to some degree known to the actors, who then take them into account as they formulate their lifecycle plans for education, consumption, saving, and retirement, plans that are further complicated by individual differences in ability. Once government programs are added to the picture, all sorts of new incentives and distortions arise, with different effects for different longevity and ability groups. Analysis of the redistributive effects of government programs must also consider the way that these individual behavioral responses will affect the outcome.====In this paper we focus on public pensions rather than considering the whole range of public programs for the elderly. We develop a model for a small open economy, the population of which exhibits heterogeneous ability and mortality leading to differences in education, income, and retirement planning. Mortality differences by long term earnings are based on the analysis in National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2015), which hereinafter we refer as ====, and the parameters of our theoretical model are calibrated to match key aspects of ==== findings. We restrict our analysis to the steady state and develop a general analytical framework of pension systems. Within this framework we focus on redistributive effects of six different public pension systems: three Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) plans and three Defined Benefit (DB) plans. An NDC pension system is a PAYG system which is designed to mimic a standard Defined Contribution (DC) system, in the sense that participants make mandatory contributions to a notional account that earns a rate of return stipulated by the government, not determined by the stock market, and is generally chosen to equal or be close to the sustainable rate of return that a PAYG system can pay—that is, the growth rate of GDP or of the wage bill. On retirement the participant uses the notional account to purchase from the government an annuity based on a similar rate of return and the remaining life expectancy, based on the life table for the participant’s generation. The NDC system provides an actuarially fair tradeoff between retirement and continuing to work, and it is expected that participants will view these contributions as an investment rather than as a tax. An NDC system should by design be approximately fiscally sustainable. In our analysis, one version of these NDC and DB plans ignores mortality differences at retirement as do all current programs. Another three versions—one NDC and two DB plans—differ in their approaches to structuring taxes/contributions or benefits so as to reduce or avoid the program inequities arising from differences in life expectancy, or to achieve redistribution more generally. These five systems are compared to an ideal NDC plan (our benchmark) in which both contributions and retirement benefits are adjusted for the mortality of each group. For concreteness, our analysis draws in various ways on the results of ==== for the US case, either with a core DB system closely resembling that of the US, or a modified NDC system that shares some quantitative features of the US case. In order to focus on the role of the mortality differences, we simplify in various ways, including assuming that the systems are in long term fiscal balance.====Our main findings stem from the behavioral responses arising from the difference in retirement age between NDC and DB plans. NDC systems minimize labor market distortions by better linking contributions to pension benefits. Thus, in NDC systems earlier or later retirement ages tend to be as neutral as possible to the budget of the social security and the individual, since benefits are automatically adjusted according to the remaining years-lived in retirement. In contrast, DB systems poorly link contributions to pension benefits as life expectancy increases. In order to re-introduce actuarial fairness, DB pension systems apply penalties/rewards for early/late retirement ages. However, when these penalties/rewards are not in line with those that are actuarially fair, the pension system not only modifies retirement behavior, but it also leads to a series of other behavioral responses that affect the wealth and welfare of individuals. In particular, our estimates indicate that under the mortality regime of the 1930 birth cohort in the US, individuals in the first three income quintiles would have retired on average two years later in non-progressive DB plans, and by one and a half years later in progressive DB plans, compared to NDC plans. This difference in the retirement age raises the marginal benefit of education in non-progressive DB plans. In contrast, despite the positive difference in the retirement age between progressive DB plans and NDC plans, in progressive DB plans the marginal benefit of education does not raise because these systems impose a high effective tax on labor. We also find that in non-progressive DB systems the average increase in lifetime income is accompanied by a fall in lifetime welfare, since the increase in lifetime income comes at the expense of less leisure time during the working period and in retirement.====Throughout the article, we will focus on how the six public pension systems redistribute income across income groups and how individuals respond to alternative pension settings and mortality regimes. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we detail the demographic characteristics of the population. In Section 3 we set a general accounting framework for simultaneously analyzing NDC and DB pension systems. In Section 4 we introduce a lifecycle model of labor supply in which individuals decide their education, hours worked, and the retirement age. Details about assumptions, data used, and parameter values are provided in Section 5. The redistributive properties of each pension system by income quintile under two mortality regimes are presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.

According to the United Nations, the proportion of the world’s population above 65 years old will nearly double from 9% to 16% between 2019 and 2050 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). This comes with important challenges, as additional resources will be necessary to meet the needs (in health and social services) of a relatively large elderly population (Seshamani and Gray, 2003). A key aspect of population aging is that it is expected to disproportionately hit developing countries. Indeed, by 2050, 80% of all older people will live in low- and middle-income countries (National Institute on Aging et al., 2018). This will exert heavy pressure on the budget of developing countries and will put at risk a population already vulnerable.====Recently, more research has been carried out in the context of developing countries to assess the impact of population aging on fiscal and macroeconomic conditions====. This paper follows this line of research by analysing the fiscal impact of population aging on the demand for social resources from people at the end of the life cycle and discusses the implications in terms of public finances. The paper focuses on the case of El Salvador, which is a relevant case study for developing countries in Central America and the Caribbean====. El Salvador is currently facing a full demographic transition (ECLAC, 2008) and as the pace of population aging is much faster than in the past, this will lead to increasing fiscal pressures (Peña and Rivera, 2018). Therefore, it is important to ensure the sustainability of public finances in the medium and long term. In this context, the empirical contribution of the paper is twofold: first, an estimation of the fiscal dividend is presented to highlight the importance for El Salvador of adopting fiscal policies in the short and medium term in a context of demographic transition. Second, a long-term budget projection is produced to assess how population aging will put pressure on government budgets.====To assess the impact of population aging on public finances in El Salvador, this study uses the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) produced by Peña and Rivera (2016) for 2010. The National Transfer Accounts (NTA) are useful in order to quantify the reallocations of economic resources among individuals of different age groups (Mason, 2007, Lee and Mason, 2011). These reallocations occur throughout the life cycle and happen in periods in which labour income is greater than consumption (usually in potentially productive ages) or in periods in which consumption is higher than labour income (usually in potentially unproductive ages) (Lee and Mason, 2011). Both situations generate public and private mechanisms that lead to transfers from people in potentially productive ages to people in potentially unproductive ages (Mason, 2007). The flows that solve these imbalances are generally grouped in transfers -public or private- and asset-based reallocations –public or private. These support mechanisms give rise to intra and intergenerational reallocation of resources between different age groups.====Using the NTA, this article presents an estimate of the fiscal dividend for El Salvador==== i.e. the relative growth of taxpayers (contributors) by public transfer receiver (Mejía and Murguía, 2012, Rosero-Bixby and Robles, 2008, Queiroz and Turra, 2014, Miller and Cruz, 2013). This dividend is currently positive due to the demographic dividend that El Salvador is experiencing. Nonetheless, the fiscal dividend will start to shrink given the evolution of the demographic dividend estimated in Peña and Rivera (2018). In addition, this paper relies on the methodology proposed by Miller (2006) and followed by Miller et al., 2011, Narayana, 2012, Miller and Cruz, 2013 for the production of a budget projection for El Salvador for the period 2020–2050 based on the fiscal structure in 2018. This projection (scenario 1), which is mainly based on the evolution of El Salvador’s population structure in the coming decades, shows that if the current fiscal structure is maintained, the share of public debt on GDP could reach an average of 125.45% in the 2040 decade. Moreover, the paper presents a hypothetical scenario (scenario 2) in which public revenues are increased progressively (the rate of growth of revenues is assumed to be higher by 3 percentage points). This outcome could stabilize the debt to GDP ratio around 80% in the 2040s. Alternatively, the paper discusses another scenario (scenario 3) in which the increase in public revenues is accompanied by a reduction in public expenditures in general services (the rate of growth of expenditures is assumed to be lower by 3 percentage points). This combination of measures could help to reduce the public debt ratio to levels of 60% of the GDP in the 2040 decade without reducing social expenditures.====The results draw attention on at least two aspects: first, the fiscal dividend will be extinguished in the 2030s. This means that, due to population aging, the rate of growth of effective receivers will increase more than proportionally with respect to the rate of growth of the effective contributors. Therefore, implementing fiscal policies to enhance the sustainability of El Salvador’s public finances would be more challenging in a context in which population aging by itself will put more pressure on the government budget. Second, the fiscal projection shows that health as well as poverty and other social protection are the two budget lines that will increase relatively the most due to population aging====. In the base scenario (Scenario 1), in which no fiscal policies are implemented to face the demographic transition, the public debt raises sharply reaching an average GDP share of 125.45% in the 2040 decade, making the debt unsustainable in the medium and long term. However, if measures on the expenditures and revenues sides are implemented, El Salvador can improve its capacity to face population aging and put the public debt on a sustainable path in the medium and long run. This highlights the urgency of implementing fiscal policies in the short and medium term to take advantage of the favorable population moment –as shown by the fiscal dividend- that El Salvador would enjoy until the 2030s.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the main channels through which population aging exerts pressure on public finances. In Section 3, the fiscal dividend is estimated while in Section 4, the methodology used to carry out the budget projection and the results are presented.

With a premise that SC is an individual-level concept in which individuals purposely invest, we estimate elderly individuals’ stock and investment in SC using ====Using four waves of the Korean ","Low birthrate and rapidly ageing population have taken up primary spots in the South Korean policy debate. According to population projections, working age population peaked in 2016 and is expected to start declining in 2020 by more than 300,000 workers annually (Vital Statistics Division, 2016). By 2020, a large bulk of the Korean baby-boom generation will retire. At the same time, social safety net and fiscal policy aimed at the elderly are inadequate to fulfill the needs of the current and prospective elderly.====Over the past several years, mass media have been raising the issues of deteriorating physical, social, and economic status among the Korean elderly. There have been reports of an upsurge in suicides, violence and economic crime among the elderly blamed on inadequate social-inclusion, healthcare, and pensions. Economic status, physical health, cognitive abilities, and life satisfaction of the retirees have come under scrutiny by macroeconomists, and healthcare and welfare professionals. The World Bank (2016) evaluated various implications of population ageing in Korea and other East Asian countries and proposed policies dealing with the root causes of problems in ageing societies, including reforms to labor policy across the life cycle, continuing education, and the inclusiveness of the welfare state. However, that report did not address adequately the elderly generation’s social engagement or their exclusion from markets and society.====Korean policymakers have recently exerted effort to reform the country’s welfare state. The Ministry of Health and Welfare provides three types of support: public services, sharing talents, and economic activities. The first involves arranging volunteer work for the elderly to give them a sense of accomplishment to the benefit of the society. The second type provides the elderly with opportunities to share their talents in special occupations, to help them establish interpersonal relationships. The last type facilitates job opportunities for the elderly in the private sector, through internships or support for firms that employ the elderly in occupations where they can demonstrate their skills. Despite government’s efforts, the effects on the elderly’s social integration are inadequate. According to a survey of living conditions and welfare needs of the elderly, respondents who never socialize are constrained by their lack of close friends, neighbors and acquaintances (Chung et al., 2011, Chung et al., 2014). Moreover, those who have no close friends, neighbors, or acquaintances make up the vast bulk of the population. The evidence suggests that social integration is crucial to enhancing the well-being of the Korean elderly, and calls for better understanding of the formation and evolution of their social capital (hereafter SC) and their engagement in society and the economy, so that more effective social policies could be implemented.====Our study contributes to policy debate by estimating the degree of elderly population’s social integration, as well as the factors affecting individuals’ investment in SC. We combine several dimensions of SC into a single measurable index using principal component analysis (PCA). Then we use linear regressions and probabilistic mixture models to identify factors explaining individuals’ SC investment and its evolution across years. Our study also contributes to literature on inequality dynamics over the life cycle (Blundell 2014) by evaluating the dynamic role of preexisting factors on SC accumulation and the trajectory of this accumulation across different demographic groups.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the existing literature on SC accumulation and its role in individuals’ wellbeing in Korea.

The data allows for a strict isolation of the effects of transition from work to retirement for both mental and physical ====. We use the lowest statutory eligibility age for full old-age pensions, 63 years, as an instrument in FE-IV estimation to ensure causal inference. We find that (1) retirement at age 63 moderately decreases the use of antidepressants, especially for women. The effect is sharp, while it is somewhat reversed in the later years; (2) the beneficial effects of retirement on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal conditions are smaller and more diffused; (3) for occupational classes, our results show a reduction in antidepressant use for women in almost all occupations, whereas for men it is significant for manual workers and farmers; (4) we find stronger declines in the anti-depressant use among men and women who retire from low- and mid-income work, as well as more robust decrease in the risk of cardiovascular diseases for high-income and non-single; and (5) our test of external validity shows that the beneficial effects in antidepressant use can be extended to apply to most Finns retiring at ages 62–64.","The current trend of declining old-age mortality rates has severely challenged the financial sustainability of the public pension schemes in almost all the high-income countries. A yet-unresolved question is how far the retirement ages can be increased without significant effects on the health of elderly workers and retirees; this is an issue of both individual welfare and public finances. While finding answers has been a goal of a large body of research literature, a great deal of uncertainty remains in the subject. The research designs are challenged by ambiguous direction of causality and heterogeneous, often unobserved characteristics of retirees. Furthermore, the empirical literature typically builds on local average treatment effects (LATE) that identify the treatment effects for only a minority of the retirees.====In this paper, we introduce new estimates for the health effects of retirement by using the individual Finnish population, retirement and health registers for the period 2000–2012. Our focus is on retirements after the 2005 pension reform while the full data window allows us to control for the trend effects of ageing prior and after the retirement. We measure the influence of retirement on mental health through purchases of antidepressants and the impact of retirement on physical health by hospital visits associated with cardiovascular or musculoskeletal diseases. We show that our results are not likely to be subject of the typical identification problems in the literature, and thus provide a good benchmark of the health impacts of retirement.====The detailed data allows us to carefully analyse the characteristics of retirees. Our health data comprise information on all prescription medications and contacts with the hospital care system of the studied individuals. Therefore, we avoid the problems related to using self-assessed health measures and non-response or loss to follow-up biases. Furthermore, we identify persons that have retired from full-time work to full retirement, with the aim of capturing all the key elements of the retirement transition (end of work, more leisure, less income). A caveat in the previous literature has been that the observed retirements often involve cases in which retirees have already ceased working due to unemployment or disability before retirement, or they may have continued working after starting to draw pensions. In these cases, results may be ambiguous due to large de facto heterogeneity in the key elements of retirement. Moreover, we observe the health outcomes for different income and socio-economic groups for which qualities of work and retirement from it may be very different.====We make use of the Finnish institutional set-up that is suitable for a quasi-experimental research design. In particular, we address the health–retirement endogeneity problem using the instrumental variable (IV) approach. The endogeneity problem arises because changes in health may also affect the decision to retire and this may easily result in biased estimates of the health effects of retirement. Following the recent literature, we use the lowest statutory eligibility age for full old-age pensions as an instrument for the actual retirement age. In the Finnish earnings-related first pillar old-age pension scheme, the statutory earliest full pension retirement age of 63 years provides particularly strong incentives for retirement from work to old-age pension, and indeed it is the most common route out of labor markets. While the statutory age is a good predictor of the true retirement age during the studied period, it is not likely by itself to affect health. Thus, the lowest eligibility age provides a strong and valid instrument.====The pension scheme at our focus dictates a large fraction of the retirement income and retirement decisions in Finland. Most of the individuals working in the private sector until old-age pension retired between the lower and the upper age limits of the flexible retirement window of 62–67 years in our data. There are simple rules for pension accrual and actuarial adjustment for postponing withdrawals. Moreover, the replacement rates and old-age poverty are on average OECD levels and thus, the Finnish system provides a framework for a representative case in terms of the income effects of retirement.====Based on our analysis, we provide new and interesting findings on the effects of retirement. We show that retirement decreases the use of antidepressants, whereas the effect on physical conditions is smaller and more diverse. For socio-economical classes, our results show a reduction in antidepressant use for women in almost all occupations, whereas for men the effect is significant only for manual workers and farmers, while the effects are much smaller for the other occupational categories. Moreover, we find stronger declines in the anti-depressant use among men and women who retire from low- and mid-income work, as well as more robust decrease in the risk of cardiovascular diseases for men who work in the high-income jobs or whose family status is other than single. For women, we also find solid evidence that the risk of using antidepressants falls sharply after retirement, while the effect is somewhat reversed in the later years.====Moreover, our detailed data set allows us also to address the generalisability of our results. A key challenge of current retirement health literature is that IV methodology only provides the LATE at the exact eligibility age. Typically, a jump in the probability of retirement as a result of reaching the statutory age limit (the first stage) suggest that only minority of the population will comply with the rule – our study is no exception. As Fig. 1 shows, in the Finnish case the increase in the probability of retirement due to reaching age 63 is at best around 30%, albeit that it is still a relatively strong effect when compared to the previous literature.==== As some people choose to retire before the statutory retirement age, and others who reach it forgo the possibility of retiring, the decision to retire provides a case of two-sided noncompliance. If there is evidence against the homogeneity of the expected (marginal) treatment effects in the population, the group of compliers is selected and the selection matters for the outcome, thus compromising the generalisability of the results.====We test the heterogeneity of the marginal effects of retirement on our health variables by applying the framework proposed by Brinch et al. (2017) in different segments of the population. We compare the health outcomes of those who retire at 63 with those who retire later or earlier, and build a rejection test statistic for treatment homogeneity.====Our general finding is that the homogeneity assumption can be rejected when comparing health outcomes far from the threshold age and if the time-invariant individual-level heterogeneity is not properly accounted for. Instead, in the age window of 62–64 years, and after considering the time-invariant effects, we do not find evidence against treatment homogeneity in the case of antidepressant use and hospital episodes due to musculoskeletal diseases. Thus, we can safely generalise our LATE results concerning these health outcome variables to the broader age window. This is important, as 68% of retirements from work to old-age pensions occur at this age interval====. On the other hand, we find some evidence suggesting that the effect of retirement on the cardiovascular hospital treatments is heterogeneous in a manner that may result in upward bias in the effect of retirement. Moreover, there are some socioeconomic groups for which the homogeneity of the treatment effect is rejected.====This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we take stock on the previous literature. Section 3 introduces our data, while Section 4 discusses our research methodology. In Section 5, we report our main results, and in Section 6 we address robustness of our results to different specifications and typical problems in statistical inference.

The paper uses a ==== specification, six measures of health (self-reported health status, activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, depression, word recall, and hypertension) and data from three waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS). We find gender and rural-urban gaps in levels and rates of decline in the health of middle-aged and older Chinese, with worse health outcomes overall and worse declines for women among those with rural household registration status (or Hukou)-rural residence. Results from the fixed effects models indicate that among men age 45 to 59 with rural ==== and residing in rural areas, health decrements are significantly associated with a lower likelihood of working and reduced work hours, earnings, and income. The work status and work hours of older women (age 60–69) with a rural ==== (regardless of rural or urban residence) are associated with health changes, while earnings or income are not. These results suggest that in China, gender, Hukou, and residence are particularly important factors to consider for the relationship between health and individual work and income outcomes for middle-aged and older adults. Overall, they point towards a need in China for policies that support health, work, and income among middle-aged and older adults in rural areas, especially among middle-aged men with rural Hukou-rural residence.","Like many countries around the world, China has undergone dramatic demographic and health transitions in recent decades. Average life expectancy has increased from around 40 in 1950 to around 70 in 2010 (Smith et al., 2014). China’s older adults (age 60 and above) will increase from under 10% of the total population in 2000 to 30% in 2050 (Kinsella and He, 2009). New challenges have arisen with chronic diseases as now the major driver of mortality and with the consequences of an aging workforce. These rapid transitions are likely to place stress on China’s health and social protection systems, which have focused on diseases at younger ages and on infectious rather than chronic diseases. It is then perhaps surprising to find that while there exists a very large literature that examines the relationships between economic status and health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), very little has been done on middle-aged and older adults in China.====Using three waves of a unique recent dataset, the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), this paper investigates how changes in health among adults aged 45 to 69 in China are associated with individual economic outcomes, in particular work and income. Specifically, we ask whether middle-aged and older individuals’ work status, hours worked, earnings, and income change alongside health. To understand how this relationship might manifest itself among different groups, we stratify our sample by gender and age as well as by rural-urban household registration status (Hukou) and residence status. This helps us to gain a deeper understanding of which groups might suffer the most from health decrements during middle and old age and thus demand more social protection.====This paper contributes to the understanding of the links between health and economic outcomes at middle and old ages in LMICs in three ways. First, we use an array of health measures to gain a more nuanced understanding of different aspects of health among middle-aged and older Chinese. Second, results are presented for the general middle-aged and older population and specific subgroups to assess vulnerability for different groups of individuals. Third, our study coincides with a period of expansion of the social protection and health insurance systems in rural China. While our study is not causal, our fixed effects specification enables us to assess the correlation between changes in health and changes in work and income outcomes and to draw with caution some implications for ongoing policy reforms and further research.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

As Germany is one of the fastest ageing countries, it has already introduced a LTC insurance scheme of the Bismarckian type in the 1990s. Since its introduction one debate concerning LTC has always been about the generosity and (long-term) financing of benefits.====In the course of this debate about the generosity of LTC insurance benefits, the Merkel administration decided to increase benefits significantly and enlarge the number of possible beneficiaries with the ====.==== To finance the reform, the contribution rate was raised from 2.35 to 2.55 per cent and a subsequent increase by 0.5 percentage points in 2019.====Several scholars such as Comas-Herrera et al., 2006, Costa-Font et al., 2008, European Commission, 2018, Fetzer et al., 2002, Häcker and Raffelhüschen, 2006, Kochskämper, 2018 or Rothgang (2010) have shown that LTC insurance is not and never has been sustainably financed, even at the onset due to the expected demographic changes. Subsequently, a funded element in addition to the pay-as-you-go financing was introduced with the ==== in 2015. This LTC capital reserve fund aims at partly financing deficits which will occur after 2035.====Within this paper, we answer the research question of the long-term implications of the recent LTC insurance reform (====. Using the methodological framework of generational accounting, we first compute sustainable contribution rates for LTC insurance after the ==== (pre-reform) as well as after the ==== (post-reform). This sustainable contribution rate serves as our macroeconomic benchmark and will offer the financial long-term adjustment requirements for LTC insurance under pre- and post-reform conditions. Second, we illustrate the future development of the contribution rate (wage tax) given the pre- and post-reform benefit levels. Finally, we calculate the reform-induced intergenerational financial impact on the cohorts born between 1916 and 2016.====As our results will show, there will be a financial pressure for LTC insurance by the 2020s at the latest. As a reaction to this financial pressure, basically four options are possible: a further increase in the contribution rate, a higher level of capital funding, and an explicit (or implicit) reduction of benefits or a combination of the three foregoing elements.==== However, with respect to the first option, a further increase in the contribution rate, there will be a limit depending on the public acceptance of the level of obligatory social security contributions. A significant worsening of the economic environment would most likely hinder further significant increases to the contribution rate. Similarly, it can be argued that the second option of higher capital funding has to be financed via a short-term increase of the contribution rate or other additional payments, which will reduce today’s disposable income of Germany’s population and will therefore be difficult to introduce with respect to the political enforceability. Moreover, the topic of an introduction of capital funding elements to ensure an adequate LTC level in the future has different aspects, which we will discuss in our conclusion.====Furthermore, the third option, an explicit cutting of benefits, seems to be a highly unlikely scenario as it would be contrary to the goals of the ====, as well as oppose public and political opinion on this topic. Hence, the most likely scenario would be an implicit reduction of benefits. With respect to this option the ====) plays an essential role within the LTC insurance scheme.

With the notable exception of Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, typically more than 70 percent of households in OECD countries own a home before retirement (see Chiuri and Jappelli (2010, p. 649)). Housing equity is by far the most dominant asset in most developed countries, dwarfing retirement accounts and other financial and non-financial assets. Despite its overall importance, the various determinants of homeownership in different countries are still heavily debated. On the one side it is seen as a pure investment vehicle while on the other side its role as a “precautionary savings device” that buffers especially long-term care shocks is highlighted. Our study adds to this literature by providing three main contributions: First, we consider homeownership as a risk management tool in retirement where households face financial risk as well as long-term care (LTC) risks. Second, we highlight the role of the public LTC insurance that reduces homeownership even when no reverse mortgages are available. Third, we isolate a novel mechanism for the impact of the public pension system on housing choices.====Our quantitative analysis focusses on the housing market in Germany, which for various reasons is an especially interesting market to study these issues. On the one side, the German homeownership rate is among the lowest in Europe for many years. Currently only 44% of German households are homeowners compared to 60% in the whole Euro area, see Mathä et al. (2017). Overall, the real estate market in Germany is quite stable with low turnover rates and very modest residential price dynamics. As a consequence, the German housing market was one of the few that avoided a slump in the wake of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, see Voigtländer (2014) as well as Mathä et al. (2017). On the other side, Germany has a long social insurance tradition and was one of the first countries to introduce a compulsory LTC insurance in 1995. Individuals are eligible to claim benefits if they are in need of care because of an illness or disability. Since the most recent reform in 2017 the condition ”in need of care” is derived in five grades which determine the benefit in cash and in kind. At the highest grade – on which we focus in the following – the maximum benefit for inpatient care reaches more than 2000 €==== ==== per month. As argued by private insurance companies, these LTC benefits cover up to 75% of total care cost at this grade level, see Verband der Privaten Krankenversicherer (2016). The remaining difference between costs of care and LTC benefits has to be financed out-of-pocket. If the care taker has no further resources, the spouse and/or the children have to pay before ultimately social assistance steps in. Our simulations indicate that without the public insurance system, homeownership in Germany would increase substantially by 25 percentage points compared to the current situation. In addition, households would also increase their stock market participation significantly. In this sense homeownership serves as a risk management tool in retirement.====Therefore, our paper adds to the literature that focusses on the interplay between homeownership and stock market participation which has a long history, but comes along with rather inconclusive findings. Owning a house introduces asset price risk and may even lead to higher liquidity risk (due to the indivisible and illiquid nature of a house). Consequently, homeownership seems to reduce the demand for risky financial assets, see Hochguertel and van Soest (2001) for the Netherlands or Yamashita (2003) for the U.S. On the other hand, homeowners are perfectly hedged against rent fluctuations (Sinai and Souleles, 2005) and inflation (Wu and Pandey, 2012) which may in turn encourage their risk taking in financial assets. Not surprisingly, Beaubrun-Diant and Maury (2016) present evidence from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) in the U.S. that the fraction of stockholders is significantly higher among homeowners than among renters, while Michielsen et al. (2016) find no effect at all of home equity and mortgage debt on the risky asset share of Dutch households. Chetty et al. (2017) argue that an increase in home equity due to rising residential prices reduces stockholding, while an increase in home equity due to a reduction in mortgage debt increases stockholding.====These seemingly contradictory empirical results are also evident in dynamic life-cycle models that highlight the interaction of tenure and portfolio choice. The seminal study in this direction was Cocco (2005), who abstracts from tenure choice and models housing as a durable consumption good and a risky investment. Owning a house generates returns in the form of consumption services from which the investor derives utility. However, house prices are uncertain and homeowners may incur large losses when they sell their house later in life. As a consequence, homeownership crowds out stock market investment and therefore helps to explain the empirically observed low participation rates on stock markets. The combination of house price risk, minimum house size and high transaction cost generates observed patterns of housing consumption over the life cycle and empirically plausible correlations in leverage and stock holdings. Yao and Zhang (2005) extend this approach by incorporating the choice between renting and owning a house. They find that investors choose substantially different portfolio allocations when owning a house versus when renting housing services. Homeowners substitute home equity for risky stocks. Hu (2005) also considers the tenure decision, but in his approach owning a house generates a higher utility than renting it. Again he documents the negative impact of homeownership on stock market participation. Exactly the opposite result is derived by Vestman (2019) in a model with preference heterogeneity, where households with a large savings motive choose to become homeowners and stock market participants, while those with small savings motives become renters and participate much less in the stock market. Our results are more in line with Vestman (2019), since we also find a positive correlation between homeownership and stock market participation. However, this is due to the fact that homeownership in Germany is a rather low-risky investment.====Finally, we also contribute to the literature that highlights the insurance aspect of homeownership. Already Venti and Wise (2004) or Poterba et al. (2011) point out that relatively few U.S. retirees tap into their housing equity to finance ordinary consumption needs. Instead it is rather used to buffer shocks to the family status (i.e. divorce, widowhood) or health (i.e. entry to a nursing home). Very similar findings are confirmed for Germany (Keese, 2012) and Great Britain (Banks et al., 2012), while Angelini et al. (2014) provide evidence for 13 European countries using life history data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARELIFE). Davidoff, 2009, Davidoff, 2010 was among the first who analyzed in a life-cycle model the role of home equity as an insurance against LTC risk in old age. As already discussed above, home equity is a large fraction of the wealth for the elderly and tends to be liquidated only late in life or when in long-term care. When hit by LTC shocks, homeowners can convert their equity into a reverse mortgage. Consequently, especially illiquid homeowners with pension wealth will hardly demand LTC insurance products on private markets, see also Laferrere (2012). Nakajima and Telyukova (2019) estimate a structural model of saving and housing tenure decisions for retired households who derive utility gains from homeownership and face longevity risk, uncertain medical expenses and borrowing constraints. In this model set-up, homeowners dissave at a slower rate than renters since they prefer to stay in their house as long as possible. Their simulations indicate that, without considering homeownership, retirees’ net worth would be 28–53 % lower in the U.S. Using the same model, Nakajima and Telyukova (2017) analyze the welfare consequences of reverse mortgage programs. On average the expected welfare gain of reverse mortgages is equivalent to just $ 252 or 0.84% of annual after-tax income. However, welfare gains are much larger for lower income and for older households. Finally, Shao et al. (2019) highlight the benefits of insurance products that combine a reverse mortgage with LTC insurance. Our model completely abstracts from reverse mortgages and considers only public LTC insurance provision. Nevertheless, we are still able to generate the substitution between LTC insurance and homeownership.====In the following we will present empirical facts reflecting portfolio structures and homeownership patterns in Germany. Afterwards we develop a life-cycle simulation model that captures the interaction between tenure choice, portfolio choice and various financial risks in retirement. In our set-up, home equity is used to buffer LTC and longevity risk, even without reverse mortgage arrangements. The homeownership rate therefore increases substantially by 20–30 percentage points if the public insurance system is eliminated.","Tenure choice, portfolio structure and long-term care – Optimal risk management in retirement",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X20300050,31 January 2020,2020,Research Article,98.0

Subjective life expectancy (SLE) is a measure of individuals’ expectation of remaining years of life. Either explicitly or implicitly, it is a key determinant of consumption and savings behaviour, and may be guided by a person’s own health and health behaviours. The Gateway to Global Aging, a platform for the Health and Retirement Study’s (HRS) family of population surveys, provides harmonised longitudinal datasets for many countries, each based on individual survey responses from respondents aged 50 and above. In this paper, we analyse SLE three of these datasets: the English ","Subjective life expectancy (SLE) has attracted the attention of economists since Dan Hamermesh (Hamermesh, 1985) pointed out the absence of any consideration of how long people are expected to live in the life-cycle models of individual consumption and saving that are central to the micro-foundations of macroeconomics. Other social scientists have also researched SLE, seeking to identify its main determinants and consequences, including retirement planning (Griffin et al., 2012, van Solinge and Henkens, 2010), health outcomes and health behaviours (Griffin et al., 2013, Kobayashi et al., 2017).====The SLE literature predominantly involves surveys where respondents are asked to assess their longevity. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and those studies deriving from it, now cover more than 70 per cent of the world’s population aged 50+. These studies have proven to be useful resources for such analysis. This literature has yielded considerable insights into SLE at the national level, yet the possibilities for cross-country comparative analyses have not been exploited until now. Two possible strategies for eliciting estimates of SLE are (1) a probabilistic method, where individuals are asked to estimate the probability of living to a given age and (2) a point estimate - where individuals are asked how long they expect to live, or when they expect to die.====This paper presents a novel cross-country analysis of SLE using data from three studies from the British Isles that are members of the HRS family: the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) and Healthy Ageing in Scotland (HAGIS). England, Ireland and Scotland have broadly similar economic, cultural and social structures, as well as a dominant common language. Actual life expectancy varies moderately across these countries. The most recent estimate of life expectancy at birth for women in Scotland is 81.1 years, in England is 82.9 years and in the Republic of Ireland is 83.4 years.====In this study we seek to answer two core research questions:====Research question 1 contributes towards the identification of those research questions that can be meaningfully addressed using SLE data. Systematic differences in SLE across cultures could reflect differences in substantive beliefs that may be associated with differential behaviours around health, saving etc. If instead the differences are the result of varying approaches to SLE elicitation across surveys, then it is important that researchers be aware of these when interpreting their results. This is one of the first papers to discuss these issues using SLE data from several countries. As such, it should provide a fertile base for future inquiry. The question is addressed in Section I: Comparing Subjective Life Expectancy Across Countries and Elicitation Procedures. Here, we introduce SLE and OLE and briefly summarize previous research comparing the two. We observe the measurement of life expectancy in ELSA, TILDA, and HAGIS, and the potential effects of their different elicitation procedures. We observe the distribution of SLE across the countries, and discuss issues of non-response and rounding, and the extent to which these can be explained by differences in numeracy and education.====Research question 2 is important because it addresses the association between the SLE differential and population characteristics. Because we standardise the SLE differential across the three data sets, we can measure the relationships between population characteristics and SLE differentials in each country, and compare these associations across countries. This is only possible when using harmonised survey data like those HRS-derived studies that are available from the Gateway To Global Ageing. The results could be of interest to researchers from a range of disciplines, from demography through epidemiology to economics. This research question is addressed in Section II: Comparing the SLE Differential Across Countries. Here, we concentrate on the SLE differential: the extent to which SLE differs from an objective measure of life expectancy (OLE) – the mortality risk indicated by population life tables. Previous research has tested whether the SLE differential varies across respondents’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics (Griffin et al., 2013, Kobayashi et al., 2017). Our study extends this research by investigating how the SLE differential varies across country: and to what extent this is explained by elicitation procedures and health characteristics.====In the final section, we summarize our key findings, discuss their likely causes and implications. We conclude with some recommendations for data collection practices in longitudinal aging studies.",How do subjective life expectancies compare with mortality tables?

In Denmark, long-term home care is predominately provided by local municipalities and is publicly financed. This paper uses a ==== approach to study the ","Ageing populations are considered one of the future megatrends affecting societies globally. It is projected that people over 80 years of age will account for around 10 per cent of the world’s population by 2050 (OECD, 2016). Politicians, stakeholders and researchers alike expect population ageing to have a major impact on labour markets, economic growth and social structures (Bloom et al., 2015; European Commission, 2018). The old-age dependency ratio (the ratio between the old and the working-age population), as well as public spending on pensions, health care and long-term home care are expected to increase significantly in the future (Bogetic et al., 2015), putting pressure on public budgets worldwide.====Denmark is one of the countries that is experiencing rapid population ageing, and it is estimated that by 2040 there will be twice as many Danes aged 80 and above than there are today (Ministry of Health, 2017). Denmark has a strong universal welfare model, and the care of older adults is predominately provided by local municipalities and publicly financed (Danmarks Statistik, 2011). Due to its welfare model, Denmark is the highest-taxed country in the OECD (OECD, 2017a, OECD, 2017).====The projected increase in persons aged 80 and above is expected to place a heavy burden on Danish municipal budgets (Kirk and Wilken, 2017) and thus lead to increased pressure on already high tax rates. In particular, the demand and expenditure for municipal long-term home care services is expected to rise, as increasing numbers of older adults with care needs continue to live in their homes due to personal preferences and ageing-in-place policies (e.g. Hajek et al., 2017). Given these challenges, an efficient allocation of resources is vital for the Danish welfare model, as is striking a balance between the municipal services provided and the population’s willingness to pay (WTP) taxes to finance these services. Previous research shows that there are indeed substantial unexplained differences in the level and quality of long-term home care services across municipalities (Houlberg, 2017), which may reflect citizens’ views and willingness to pay taxes to finance such services.====This paper uses a stated preferences/discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach to study the WTP for various components of long-term home care services for older people in the Danish welfare state context. Publicly financed long-term home care services are not traded on a market. Hence real choice data on the trade-off between costs and service levels are not available. Stated preference data are therefore essential in this setting.====Knowledge about how WTP is associated with peoples’ characteristics is relevant for policy makers who wish to increase the quality of long-term home care, as it can be used to guide the distribution of additional costs among taxpayers. Moreover, associations between peoples' characteristics and WTP provide information on how WTP may develop in the future, as the composition of the population changes. Furthermore, information on the association between political preferences and WTP may serve as guidance for policy makers as to which dimensions of long-term home care that may be improved under which political regimes.====We use a large dataset representing the Danish adult population of working age (18–65 years old) to investigate the WTP for different long-term home care service attributes. We ask respondents to consider a hypothetical individual – an 83-year old woman with physical limitations who lives alone – and to choose between various municipal service-packages for her. Each service-package gives an increase in yearly taxes per household. Thus, our DCE closely resembles the actual situation in Denmark, in which the municipality provides publicly financed, long-term home care services for older people.====In our setting, consistency between the attributes and levels of the choice sets and actual long-term home care packages offered by Danish municipalities was a prime concern. We therefore focus on attributes and levels corresponding to services and modes of delivery currently available in Danish municipalities. In addition, to increase the probability of all respondents being able to make informed choices we focus on services that are widely known and easy to relate to, such as meal services and cleanliness of accommodation.====We find that respondents generally have significant positive preferences for improving long-term home care services. WTP varies by respondent characteristics and is positively associated with age, being politically oriented towards the left and being employed, and is negatively associated with having a high level of education, having right-wing political preferences, having children aged 6–18 years and, somewhat surprisingly, having user or work experience of the long-term home care sector. We conclude that WTP for tax-financed, long-term home care services is closely linked to respondent characteristics.====Our findings are relevant for countries with tax financed long-term home care systems, which are often struggling to maintain quality within public budgets pressured by population ageing. Moreover, they are relevant for countries, e.g. in eastern and central Europe, that do not yet have a system for providing long-term care but that may wish to establish one.====Despite the challenges related to population ageing and the provision of long-term home care, few previous studies have addressed WTP for long-term home care services. Nieboer et al. (2010) conducted a DCE under the Dutch comprehensive public long-term care insurance system. In their DCE, respondents were to choose service packages and associated co-payments for four hypothetical patients. The study found that the hypothetical patient’s social and physical situation influenced respondents’ choices. For instance, respondents avoided choice sets involving nursing homes for all hypothetical patients, except for the patient described as living alone and suffering from dementia. However, the Nieboer et al. (2010) study elicits WTP via co-payments for the hypothetical patient and not for the respondent. Thus, the respondents’ WTP for long-term care services for others (or for themselves) remains unclear.====A study by Callan and O’Shea (2015) used the contingent valuation method to investigate WTP for various forms of community-based long-term care in Ireland and found strong preferences for family care – the currently predominant mode of care in the country. The study used an increase in annual taxation as the WTP payment vehicle. However, the results exhibited a low degree of convergent validity between respondents’ ranking of alternatives and their WTP values, i.e. respondents’ rankings were not consistent with their WTP. Furthermore, the study does not provide insight into the relative preferences for different long-term care service attributes, which is necessary for allowing the identification of their efficient combination.====Two additional recent studies have investigated preferences for long-term care services in a stated preferences framework, but without considering WTP. Kaambwa et al. (2015) investigated preferences for consumer-directed care in Australia (in which user co-payments apply) and found that both consumers (older people) and informal carers prefer to have a high degree of flexibility concerning, for example, choice of care workers and choice of activities in their care plan. Netten et al. (2012) investigated care preferences in the UK – a country characterised by requiring users to make substantial assets- and income-related co-payments towards long-term care. They found that respondents have strong preferences for having a high degree of control over their situation and a high degree of personal cleanliness and comfort.====Our study contributes to the scarce literature on WTP for long-term home care services by being the first to use a design that closely mimics the actual situation in a comprehensive welfare state setting. The study proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the Danish setting for long-term home care. Section 3 describes the data, experimental design and variables used in the analyses.

Our findings support the value of a life course approach in identifying the key determinants of health in old age.","Population aging has become an emergent global trend. The number of older persons – those aged 60 years or over – has increased substantially in China and the world, from 125.2 million and 0.61 billion (or both 9.9% of the population) in 2000–209.2 million and 0.90 billion (or 15.2% and 12.3% of the population) in 2015. This growth is projected to accelerate in the coming decades, to reach almost 358.1 million and 1.40 billion (or 25.3% and 16.5% of the population) by 2030 and nearly 491.5 million and 2.09 billion (or 36.5% and 21.5% of the population) by 2050 (United Nations, 2015) in China and the world. Healthy aging has become a very important theme for society, especially in China where the population ages fast.====As a key component of human capital, strong evidence suggests that the return to health investment is the highest in early life (Cunha and Heckman, 2009). The WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health highlights the role of childhood conditions as a primary source of unfair health inequality (Marmot et al., 2008). It is therefore important to assess the role of childhood circumstances in explaining the widening health gradient (Shen and Zeng, 2014, Bor et al., 2017). Growing evidence shows that a wide range of childhood circumstances could affect physical, cognitive, and mental health in old age, such as family socioeconomic status and parent’s educational attainments (Dahl and Birkelund, 1997, Moody-Ayers et al., 2007, Ramos, 2007, Zhang et al., 2008, Katikireddi, 2016, Gale et al., 2016), nutrition condition in childhood (Palloni et al., 2005, McEniry et al., 2008), health status in childhood (Sayer et al., 2004, Kuh et al., 2006, Dodds et al., 2012, Cooper et al., 2014), parenting skills (Andersson and Stevens, 1993, Krause, 1998), service capacity in the community (Shen, 2014), social mobility (Venkataramani et al., 2016), and maternal bereavement (Black et al., 2016, Persson and Rossin-Slater, 2017). This paper aims to assess an array of key circumstances to identify the overall role of childhood circumstances on health inequality in old age.====Health inequality prevails in old age, which may originate from both early life circumstances and efforts (Thorslund and Lundberg, 1994, Rueda et al., 2008, Marmot et al., 2008). Inequality of Opportunity in health (IOP in health, a.k.a. health inequality due to circumstances) is beyond the realm of individuals’ choices, whereas individuals should be responsible for health inequality due to efforts (Lefranc et al., 2008). Since circumstance factors in early life are uncontrollable by the individual, childhood circumstances are largely seen as illegitimate sources of health inequalities. On the contrary, differences in health status that are due to efforts, such as lifestyle, are often seen as ethically justified by individual choice (Roemer and Trannoy, 2016). Therefore, the policy implications of IOP are that actions should be taken to compensate for health inequality resulting from childhood circumstances (Roemer et al., 2003, Rosa-Dias and Jones, 2007, Lefranc et al., 2008, Rosa-Dias, 2009, Fleurbaey and Schokkaert, 2009, Trannoy et al., 2010).====It is difficult to define the exact set of childhood circumstances that contribute to health inequality. This paper classifies a comprehensive set of circumstances into eight domains most comparable to existing studies on IOP for income, such as Hufe et al. (2017). Specifically, the circumstances we measured in childhood include war, regional and urban/rural status, family socioeconomic status, parents’ health status and health behaviors, health and nutrition status, relationship with parents, friendship, and access to health care.====Using the mean logarithmic deviation (MLD) approach, this paper quantifies health inequality due to childhood circumstances (for which they have little control) that are distinguishable from health inequality due to efforts (for which they are responsible). We also measure relative contribution by domain of childhood circumstances using the Shapley value decomposition approach.====Compared to growing evidence from developed countries (Rosa-Dias, 2009, Trannoy et al., 2010, Bricard et al., 2013, Lazar, 2013, Garcia-Gomez et al., 2014) and developing countries (Jusot et al., 2014, Carranza and Hojman, 2015, Pal, 2015, Barbosa, 2016, Fajardo-Gonzalez, 2016), our study may contribute to the literature in four aspects. First, we advance the literature on life course epidemiology that has mostly been limited to shorter time periods, such as a decade in Simmonds et al. (2015). In contrast, we link individuals’ health outcomes at least 50 years apart to provide novel evidence of IOP in health in old age. Second, we examine IOP in health using by far the most comprehensive set of health measures. This represents an important advance as WHO (2017) defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of diseases. In contrast, most studies, such as Trannoy et al., 2010, Bricard et al., 2013, only evaluate a very small set of health outcomes. Third, we utilize a well-measured rich set of childhood circumstances to address the concern that poor information on childhood circumstances may undervalue IOP and therefore mislead policymakers into a false sense of complacency that health inequality is largely fair (Kanbur and Wagstaff, 2016). Fourth, we offer novel evidence of IOP in health of the Chinese elderly. As a country with the world’s largest aging population, IOP in health among Chinese elders should be of much concern.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In this paper, we examine the impact of social security expansion on neighborhood cohesion of ==== using China’s New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS), one of the largest existing pension program in the world. Since its launch in 2009, more than 400 million Chinese have enrolled in NRPS. We use two waves of China Health and Retirement ","Neighborhood cohesion has long been argued to play an important role in the health and well-being of the aging population through, for example, informal network of relationships and shared values (Blazer, 1982, Tomaka et al., 2006, Golden et al., 2009, James et al., 2011, Hudson, 2017). A lack of social contacts among older adults has been shown to be associated with an estimated $6.7 billion in additional Medicare spending annually in the U.S. (Flowers et al., 2017). The rapid aging of the world population further highlights the importance of attention to the health and well-being of older adults. To alleviate poverty and mitigate its health effects in older adults, governments of 106 countries have rolled-out social pension programs (Pension Watch, 2017). Despite increasing efforts to evaluate the impacts of pensions on the elderly’s income, health, and well-being (e.g., Case, 2004, Jensen and Richter, 2004, Lei et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2019), existing research has failed to adequately explore the causal impact of pension income on neighborhood cohesion, such as via social networking and social support.====Although government programs in services and income support have been found to bring multiple benefits (e.g., Duflo, 2000, Lovo, 2011, Hoynes et al., 2016, Cheng et al., 2018), some have promoted a crowding out hypothesis, in which grants and services provided by the government may reduce social networks and other informal arrangements (Etzioni, 1995, Putnam, 2000). Studies based on household survey data and experiments mainly focus on the crowding out effect on private transfers and predict varying degrees of crowding out effects of public transfers (e.g., Cox et al., 1998, Albarran and Attanasio, 2003, Juarez, 2009, Jensen, 2004, Stadelmann-Steffen, 2011). Despite dominant findings on crowd-out effects in the literature, some studies based on cross-country comparison refute the claims of crowding out. Comparing eight-scale measurement model of social capital of 23 European countries at both country and individual levels, Van Oorschot and Arts (2005) find that the only evidence for crowd-out effect lies in the case of people’s trustworthiness, and most of their findings regarding other forms of social capital, for example, relations with friends, trust in institutions, and interpersonal trust, contradict the crowding out hypothesis. Some other researchers find that more generous welfare payments benefit neighborhood cohesion by increasing the total insurance available to people (e.g., Heemskerk et al., 2004, Gelissen et al., 2012). These contradictory findings suggest that crowd-out effects may vary across different contexts and methods.====Empirical research examining the causal relationship between public pension programs and neighborhood cohesion, an important form of public goods, is limited. The expansion of the New Rural Pension System (NRPS) in China, a nationwide pension system, presents an ideal opportunity to explore the potential crowding out effects related to expanding pension benefits. Launched in 2009, the NRPS is a public transfer of resources to residence above 60 in rural China. It is non-contributory for the elderly above age 60 at the time of roll-out in the county, and whether an individual is eligible to receive this pension does not depend on the own past work history====.====This paper explores the impact of pension benefits on two essential dimensions of neighborhood cohesion of the elderly, i.e., collective recreational activities and altruistic activities such as helping others in the community====. We do this by empirically testing the effects of the NRPS on individuals’ participation in ==== (measured by playing Ma-jong, chess, cards, going to a sport, social, or other kinds of community clubs, or joining a community-related organization) and in ==== (measured by voluntarily providing help to or caring for those in need in the community).====Theoretically, the effects of receiving pension on elders’ neighborhood cohesion as indicated by collective recreational activities and altruistic activities are ambiguous. First, collective recreational activities include collectively organized activities in the community that are mainly recreational and to some extent also help build or maintain networks in the neighborhood. More income may enable older adults to devote more leisure time to such activities because of the income effect. However, the pension program offers an alternative form of risk sharing, which may weaken demand for social networking function of collective recreational activities and therefore lower realized participation in such activities. Second, altruistic activities involve providing social supports to those in need, partly in exchange for informal insurance against future risks. On the one hand, receiving a pension may relax budget constraints on both time and money, effectively conferring greater resources on elders to invest more efforts in altruistic activities that add to neighborhood cohesion. On the other hand, government-funded pensions may offer more financial security in old age, which in turn crowd out elders’ demand for social support and therefore may attenuate individuals’ propensity to offer support to the community. In both cases of collective recreational activities and altruistic activities, the pension program is expected to erode neighborhood cohesion if the crowd-out effect dominates, or strengthen neighborhood cohesion if the income effect dominates. Relative to collective recreational activities, altruistic activities are reciprocal with more feature of public goods for risk sharing, and thus may tend to be subject to more crowd-out because of pension. Therefore, we hypothesize that pension provision may discourage altruistic activities more than collective recreational activities.====To test these hypotheses, we use the waves 2011 and 2013 of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The CHARLS is a nationally representative sample of Chinese residents aged 45 and above collected by Peking University. It was designed as a HRS-sister==== study to facilitate cross-country comparisons. Our analysis is restricted to rural residents age 60 and older with rural-==== and had not participated in other social pension programs, which means they were eligible to receive the NRPS pension. To overcome the endogeneity of pension receipt, we use the duration of the NRPS in the county as the instrumental variable in the main analyses. Reduced form analyses also used to check the robustness of the results.====We also examine potential heterogeneities of pension program effects on recreational and altruistic activities to better understand the mechanisms behind our main findings. Specifically, we test the effects of pension by community diversity (defined by whether to have two major surnames accounting for more than half of the local population) and by family income. We show that pension benefits impose no significant impact on collective recreational activities, even for the poor whose budget tends to be more binding. Meanwhile, pension saliently crowds out altruistic activities, but no distinguishable effects are identified by community diversity. Our suggestive evidence indicates no declined social support pensioners may obtain from others as a results of pension receipt, therefore the crowd-out of altruistic activities can be interpreted as formal old age support in the form of pension replacing some demand for risk insurance scheme.====The paper makes novel contributions to the literature on public pensions and neighborhood cohesion. First, to our knowledge, we are the first to explore the causal relationship between pension and neighborhood cohesion at the individual level. Previous literature about the impacts of pension was mostly focused on income, health, well-being, private transfers, and living arrangements. (e.g., Jensen, 2004, Cai et al., 2012, Cheng et al., 2016, Cheng et al., 2018, Chen et al., 2019). None has explored its effect on recreational and altruistic activities. Another branch of literature on the relationship between the welfare system and social capital is mostly country comparisons. The findings from previous studies are incomplete and potentially biased considering that they cannot control for all key differences that might affect social capital across countries (e.g., Van Oorschot and Arts, 2005, Stadelmann-Steffen, 2011). Thus, our study adds to the limited literature on the evaluation of social pension programs. Second, our results might be important for policy discourse. We show that even a modest public pension can have important implications for neighborhood cohesion via reduced altruistic activities among older adults. Given that many countries are aging fast with limited societal support, our study may have important policy implications globally.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Yet the impact of this program is mitigated if those eligible fail to enroll. This paper examines the extent to which pension-eligible individuals, and their families, make optimal pension decisions. Families are involved in the NRPS decisions because, in most cases, adult children need to enroll as a prerequisite of their parents’ receipt of benefits. We examine the decisions of both those eligible for pension benefits (i.e. over 60 years old) and their adult children. We use the rural sample of the 2012 China Family Panel Study to study determinants of the decision to enroll in NRPS, premiums paid, and time taken to enroll. We find evidence of low and suboptimal pension enrollment by eligible individuals and their families. Suboptimal enrollment takes various forms including failure to switch from the dominated default pension program to NRPS and evidence that families do not make mutually beneficial intra-family decisions. For the older cohort, few individual and family characteristics are significant in enrollment decisions, but village characteristics play an important role. For the younger cohort, more individual-level characteristics are significant, including own and children’s education. Village characteristics are important but not as much as for the older cohort. Our finding of suboptimal enrollment is important as it highlights the need for policies to improve enrollment. This paper provides needed information on the extent of the factors relating to suboptimal enrollment.","In 2009, China introduced to its rural population the world’s largest social pension, the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS). This covered population tends to have lower education and lower income and worse health than its urban counterpart. The NRPS was designed to provide the rural elderly, especially those with low income, with basic protection against poverty in old age. The NRPS was also introduced in part due to erosion of the traditional system of intergenerational cohabitation, in which children would provide in-person care for elderly family members and share incomes. The lower rates of cohabitation with children are due to both the large outmigration of younger generations and the persistent decline in the fertility rate. Consequently, the elderly currently need more market-based services to substitute for the lack of in-person family care. Further, the increased life expectancy in China leaves the elderly living alone for more years.==== Thus, rural elderly are increasingly likely to suffer from too little support without the rural pension system. However, without a high uptake of NRPS, protection will remain low.====The NRPS was also launched to replace the failed, unsubsidized rural pension program initiated in the 1990s, i.e. the Old Rural Pension Scheme (ORPS). In contrast to ORPS, both the central and local governments generously subsidize the NRPS. The subsidy is particularly robust for those in the special phase-in period at program initiation, allowing elderly persons at the time of local rollout to receive benefits despite never having paid into the system. This special phase-in period provides an important opportunity to study enrollment decisions.====We use the 2012 China Family Panel Study (CFPS) to explore determinants of the decision to enroll in NRPS, premiums paid, and time to enrollment. This paper empirically investigates the extent to which people respond to the new pension program with optimal financial decisions. To the extent that they do not respond optimally, we also examine who fails to enroll, and why. Specifically, we examine the economic incentives to enroll and factors that could directly and indirectly affect enrollment decisions. The rollout of the program to all counties in China prior to the 2012 survey provides us with the opportunity to observe three key enrollment decisions: to enroll or not, timing of enrollment, and size of individual premium contribution. We examine these decisions both for those eligible for a pension and their adult children. We focus on the latter due to the requirement that children need to enroll to make their elderly parents eligible for NRPS, and because they may also have their own motivations to enroll for their futures.====The ==== in China requires at least one child (aged 16 years or above, not enrolled in school, and holding rural registration) to enroll in the NRPS to make their elderly parents eligible for pension benefits. Note that a large proportion of elderly parents have multiple children due to the loosely implemented One Child Policy in rural China. The enrolling adult child must pay premiums each year for parents to receive pension payments. We examine separately the incentives and decisions of those over and under the age of 60, due to this important policy and other differences in coverage and contribution requirements by age. Specifically, we separately examine individuals over age 60 who have children, and also those between the ages of 45 and 60. We ignore those under 45 for two main reasons: first, they have little incentive to enroll until later in life, even with the ====; second, this paper focuses on suboptimal pension choices in the intergenerational context, but those under age 45 often have no eligible adult children to be subject to the ====. People above age 60 have straightforward incentives to enroll in NPRS as it is noncontributory for this initial cohort of the elderly. The decisions of people aged 45–60 are more complicated for several reasons. Importantly, their decision to enroll may be affected by the desire to ensure benefits for their parents. If they choose to enroll, they also must decide when to enroll, and at what level of premiums.====We find that only half of the small percentage of childless seniors who could benefit immediately without being subject to the ==== enroll. Children and their elderly parents could make intergenerational arrangements to enroll, and have immediate pension benefits to both generations, but many fail to do so, thus leaving money ‘on the table’. Moreover, a sizable portion of respondents could obtain higher benefits simply by switching from the unsubsidized ORPS (the default program) to the highly subsidized NRPS, but again fail to do so.==== Perhaps surprisingly, the poorest households (in the bottom quintile) in age cohort 45–60 are less likely to enroll as compared to their richer counterparts even though there would likely be intergenerational benefits. And none of the lowest quintiles enroll more rapidly despite presumably having more to gain in terms of improvement in their well-being.====Our empirical investigation has several notable strengths. First, we contribute to the literature by making the first attempt to examine suboptimal pension enrollment and exploring plausible explanations to the puzzle of low pension enrollment and, more generally, inadequate planning for old age.==== Second, we contribute to the literature by examining intra-family and intergenerational arrangements as they are key to optimal pension decisions. Our ability to link older parents and children (even those who have migrated) enables us to observe intra-family dynamics. Third, because the 2012 CFPS survey was fielded on average two years after the implementation of NRPS, we can compare the actual enrollment to some clear-cut gains to enrollment that occurred in the initial rollout. In this post-enrollment period, respondents would have had ample time to make decisions. Further, we collect and match county administrative data on pension roll-out with individual’s pension choices to obtain precisely measured pension enrollment decisions.====Another contribution of this paper is that while most of the literature on pension decisions relates to the developed world, this paper examines pension decisions in a middle-income country. As the country with the world’s largest population and pension system, China’s experience demands analysis. In addition, the program is growing dramatically as China is currently integrating rural and urban social pensions. Once completed, this unified pension system may serve more than 800 million residents, doubling the current size of the NRPS (Chen, 2016). Thus, lessons learned from analysis of the NPRS have an immediate application.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We combine NTA data with information from life tables to derive measures of gender-specific net transfers over the whole life course and by life stages. The analysis distinguishes between public and private transfer flows, and accounts for transfers of services produced by ====. Furthermore, we analyse public transfers in more detail by decomposing public old-age benefits into yearly averages and the number of years that individuals can expect to be net recipients. In all analysed countries, men contribute more to public transfers and ==== a larger proportion of consumption needs of children, compared to women. By contrast, women provide most of the transfers of services produced by ====, such as childcare and household work. While yearly net public benefits in old age are considerably smaller for women in most countries, total public benefits over the whole retirement period are higher for women due to their higher life expectancy.","Economic transfers between generations are essential elements of society. Typical for the human life course are periods of dependency in childhood and old age, characterised by consumption exceeding production. A large part of the consumption needs in childhood and old age are covered by transfers between generations.==== In Europe, intra-family transfers from parents play the most important role for children, while the needs of the retired population are mainly covered by public transfers.====Men and women differ considerably in their roles as providers and recipients of intergenerational transfers. Men are characterised by higher employment rates and higher income than women. For example, in Austria, Germany, Italy and the UK, men generated about two-thirds of total labour income in 2010. In Slovenia, the country with the lowest gender differences in average labour income, men still generated about 55 per cent of total labour income (Hammer et al., 2015). Consequently, men pay a higher share of income-based taxes and social contributions, thereby providing a larger proportion of public transfers to the elderly generation. Because of their higher labour income, men also finance a larger share of the consumption needs of children.====Unpaid household work and childcare also constitute important intergenerational transfers. These activities are mainly carried out by women, who are net providers of unpaid services to children and other adult household members. Vargha et al. (2017) estimate that working-age women carry out 2–4 h of unpaid work each day for other household members. Transfer contributions in form of unpaid work vary substantially between European countries and are found to be particularly large for women in Italy and Spain, corresponding to about 4 h of unpaid work throughout the entire working age.====The specialisation of women in unpaid work is among the main determinants for the lower pensions of women in most European countries. Having a child is usually associated with an increase of unpaid work for women, along with a reduction of paid work, lower contributions to the pension system and consequently lower pensions (Blau and Kahn, 2017). Overall, European women aged 65 + received 39 per cent less pension than men in 2009. The calculation of this gap includes persons without own pension. The pension gap is found to be lowest in most former socialist countries, where the difference between average male and female pension income in the elderly population 65 + is 20 per cent and less (Bettio et al., 2013). During socialism, the participation of women in paid work was encouraged, resulting in smaller differences between the careers of men and women. By contrast, in Luxembourg, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Spain and Malta, the gender gap in pension income is 45 per cent or more.====While average yearly pensions are lower for women, they are net receivers of public transfers for a much longer period than men. In most European countries, women retire considerably earlier than men (OECD, 2019a) but have a much higher life expectancy. The average difference between male and female life expectancy at age 60 in the European Union is four years (Eurostat, 2019a). It is therefore important to differentiate between yearly net benefits and the accumulated net benefits over a lifetime when analysing gender inequalities in the intergenerational transfer system.====For this analysis, we measure and analyse gender differences in transfer contributions and benefits at each life stage and over lifetime for 15 European countries. In particular, we address the following two research questions: (i) How large are gender differences in net intergenerational transfers over lifetime when all types of transfers are considered, including transfers in form of unpaid work? (ii) Does the public transfer system advantage men or women when life expectancy is taken into account?====This is the first paper that uses the comprehensive European National Transfer Accounts data for analysing gender-specific intergenerational transfers. It contributes to the discussion on gender equality in the transfer system by measuring transfers in form of unpaid work and by quantifying the effect of gender differences in life expectancy on transfers over lifetime. Even when women and men receive about the same amount of public transfers in lifetime terms, it is still problematic if they have to live from much lower yearly pensions than men and face a higher risk of poverty in old age (Eurostat, 2015). On the other hand, men spend and enjoy a much lower number of years in retirement than women, despite their substantial contribution to the transfer system. It is important to explore gender inequalities considering differences in the level and duration of public old-age benefits. Especially, since these dimensions are crucial levers for adjusting the public transfer system in the context of population ageing.",The gender dimension of intergenerational transfers in Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X19301215,14 December 2019,2019,Research Article,104.0

We find that, once differences in socioeconomic factors are accounted for, the cognitive function of male ","There is a large literature documenting the so-called Hispanic Health Paradox (HHP), that is, the epidemiological finding that some health outcomes of Hispanics residing in the United States are comparable to, and in some cases better than, those of non-Hispanic whites (Hummer et al., 2007, Markides and Coreil, 1986, Riosmena et al., 2013, Sorlie et al., 1993). The strongest version of the HHP has been found to apply to mortality and hypertension. In terms of these two outcomes, Hispanics, and particularly Mexican-born immigrants, fare better than NH whites even before controlling for SES (Abraído-Lanza et al., 1999, Palloni and Arias, 2004, Riosmena et al., 2013). The phenomenon is considered paradoxical because Hispanics have, on average, a lower socioeconomic status (SES) than non-Hispanic whites (Jiménez, 2011, Williams and Collins, 1995), and there is ample evidence of a positive association between SES and health (Chandola et al., 2007, Feinstein, 1993, Goldman, 2001, Meara et al., 2008, Minkler et al., 2006, Smith, 2004).====For other health outcomes, a weaker form of the HHP holds, whereby Hispanic migrants fare better than NH whites of the same SES. For example, Riosmena et al. (2013) find lower rates of diabetes and obesity for Mexican-born immigrants than NH whites after controlling for educational attainment. An even weaker version of the HHP holds when the health outcomes of Hispanics are worse than those of NH whites, but compare favorably to those of other minorities. For example, Sloan and Wang (2005) find that Hispanics perform worse than whites but better than blacks on a series of cognitive tasks. Finally, the immigrant advantage may not extend to all health outcomes, as implied by the results in Eschbach et al. (2007), which show no statistically significant differences in old-age disability between foreign-born and U.S.-born Mexican Americans.====This paper investigates the presence of an immigrant advantage in cognitive function for Mexican-born individuals. Previous studies have documented that Hispanics perform worse than NH whites in cognitive tasks and are at a higher risk for dementia. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)—a nationally-representative, longitudinal survey of the older U.S population—Díaz-Venegas et al. (2016) found that Hispanics have lower cognitive functioning than NH whites after controlling for education. Sloan and Wang (2005) also report worse cognitive performance of Hispanics relative to whites. Chen and Zissimopoulos (2018) use data from the HRS and find that Hispanics have higher odds of being diagnosed with dementia after controlling for chronic conditions, drug treatment, and lifestyle factors as well as SES. Lines et al. (2014) find that Hispanics have a higher prevalence of and mortality from Alzheimer’s disease, a type of dementia. These papers do not assess potential differences between foreign- and U.S.-born Hispanics, nor among Hispanics by country of origin.====In this paper, we measure cognitive outcomes of Mexican-born individuals currently living in the U.S. (“Mexican immigrants”) relative to those of non-Hispanic whites (“NH whites”) and perform separate analyses by gender. Consistent with previous studies which find worse cognitive outcomes for Hispanics, we find no evidence of a strong version of the HHP for cognitive function: both male and female Mexican immigrants perform significantly worse than NH whites in five tasks designed to evaluate cognitive performance.==== Once one controls for socioeconomic indicators, however, a new paradox emerges. While the cognitive performance of male Mexican immigrants becomes statistically indistinguishable from that of NH whites after controlling for education and income, the cognitive scores of female Mexican immigrants remain significantly below those of NH whites.====This is the first study, to our knowledge, to document a cognitive gap for female Mexican immigrants relative to female non-Hispanics whites.==== ====The finding is relevant because low cognitive performance is a risk factor for dementia, and indeed the cognition tasks we focus on in the paper are the basis of screening tools for cognitive dysfunction (Carpenter et al., 2011, Katzman et al., 1983, Mendiondo et al., 2003, Zissimopoulos et al., 2014).==== Thus, Mexican-born females currently residing in the U.S. might be at an elevated risk for dementia.====As a second contribution, the paper proposes and tests four potential (and non-mutually exclusive) explanations for the cognitive gap of female Mexican immigrants. The “risk factor hypothesis” posits that the relative incidence of risk factors for dementia among Mexican immigrants relative to NH whites is higher in the sample of women than in that of men. The “survival bias hypothesis” states that the mortality rate of male Mexican immigrants with low cognition is higher, relative to their white counterparts, than that of female Mexican immigrants. The “differential selection hypothesis” holds that female Mexican immigrants are less positively selected than their male counterparts in terms of either their cognitive level or predisposition to cognitive decline when compared with either the non-migrant Mexican population or the population of return migrants. Finally, male Mexican immigrants may display cognitive outcomes that are more similar to those of NH whites because they are better acculturated to their new setting than their female counterparts (the “acculturation hypothesis”). Our results provide some support for the differential selection hypothesis, but we do not find evidence consistent with the risk factor, differential survival, or acculturation hypotheses.====To measure the cognitive gap between Mexican immigrants and NH whites and empirically assess the risk-factor, survival bias, and acculturation hypotheses, we use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which provides scores for a battery of cognitive instruments, as well as extensive information on health status, health behaviors, household income, demographics, and age of arrival to the U.S. for Mexican immigrants. To assess the differential selection hypothesis, we construct a merged dataset with the subsample of Mexican immigrants from the HRS and the full sample from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS). We split the latter into two subsamples, namely Mexicans without a history of migration to the United States (“non-migrants”) and Mexicans with a history of migration to the United States (“return migrants”).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

While it is sometimes argued that a mismatch between the actual number of hours worked and people’s preferences about the amount of work they want has an association with mental health, findings are mixed. Moreover, ==== and age-specific factors are often not included in studies exploring these relationships. This paper examines the link between working hours mismatch, job strain and mental health in Australia, focusing on mature age workers (aged 45–64 years), a group of workers for whom these issues have seldom been explored. Results from our panel data estimations, using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, show significant associations between a mismatch of working hours – that is, either working more or less than one’s desired hours – and poorer mental health. Our analysis also suggests that jobs characterised by low levels of control and high demands have a significant negative impact on reported mental health scores. Designing flexible working environments and giving workers more ==== should be priorities in order to improve the general mental health of mature age workers.","A 2017 survey found that 40 per cent of the Australian workforce is over 45 years old (ABS, 2017) and this number will likely increase in the upcoming years. Over the past decade, there has been a notable increase in the labour market participation of people aged between 45 and 64 years. However, working at a mature age may not be easy; with some employers favouring younger workers, many mature age workers, particularly those in part-time jobs, work fewer than their desired hours. Such a phenomenon is often described as underemployment and mature age workers in Australia are prone to longer periods of underemployment than younger people (Li et al., 2015). Growing part-time and “flexible” work arrangements are likely to push these numbers even higher. Moreover, it is not only sufficiency in terms of working hours that matters; job quality and a fit with employees’ needs and preferences contribute to the quality of life of mature age workers, as discussed in Brown et al. (2015).====Unfortunately, the number of working hours does not depend only on an employee’s choice, but is also influenced by employers’ decision making, and this is a reality that is relevant for older as well as younger workers (Gielen, 2009). This paper focuses on examining the association between hours mismatch and mental health among mature age workers in Australia, an area which is still understudied. Previously, a stress process model (Pearlin, 1989, Pearlin et al., 1981) has been used, providing a theoretical framework to study the effects of underemployment by identifying potential mechanisms linking stressors to adverse health outcomes. More specifically, previous literature has noted that work hour constraints may have an effect on (i) self-assessed health in general, (ii) subjective wellbeing such as life satisfaction or job satisfaction, (iii) psychological wellbeing or (iv) mental health (see, for example, Bell et al., 2012, Burns et al., 2016). The separation between subjective wellbeing and psychological wellbeing in the literature follows the approach used in Burns et al. (2016, p. 726), in which psychological wellbeing refers to psychological functioning such as a sense of competence, autonomy, resilience, relatedness, purpose in life, personal growth and self-acceptance.====Although not focusing specifically on mature age workers, previous research has produced mixed findings on the association between actual and preferred hours worked and health. For example, Bassanini and Caroli (2015) provided an extensive literature review regarding the relationship between work and health and concluded that there is a negative association between working hour gap (the difference between the actual and desired hours of work) and health. Further, Dollard and Winefield (2002) discussed various work states and drew upon a range of work stress and unemployment theories to explain the associations between work states and mental health in Australia. In the Australian context, there are mixed findings, with some studies identifying an association between an hours mismatch and either mental health or subjective wellbeing, while others suggest no association between the two (see, for example, Adam and Flatau, 2006, Dockery, 2006, Kugler et al., 2014, Milner et al., 2015, Otterbach et al., 2016, Wilkins, 2007, Wooden et al., 2009). Interestingly, Dockery, 2006, Otterbach et al., 2016, Wooden et al., 2009 all argued that, compared with underemployment, overemployment has a larger impact on mental health, while Adam and Flatau, 2006, Wunder and Heineck, 2013 have argued the opposite. De Moortel et al. (2017) found that the impact varies depending on gender. They found that involuntary overwork was positively associated with poor mental wellbeing for men, but for women overwork (regardless of voluntariness) and involuntary underwork were positively associated with poor mental wellbeing. The literature has also discussed other factors that can influence mental health, including prior employment status, initial mental health status, marital status, types of job contract and the types of work that people do. For the latter, particularly, the issue of job strain is strongly relevant.====The job strain literature aims to discuss the negative consequences of strain at work represented by job demand and job control. However, we were unable to find a study in Australia that has investigated this issue. In practice, beyondblue (2016) has also identified common risk factors for mental wellbeing in the workplace, which include heavy workloads; strict deadlines and targets; unclear roles and responsibilities; low control over how the job is carried out; challenging working hours; high emotional, mental or physical demands; lack of recognition or feedback; bullying and/or poorly managed behaviours; and discrimination. Mental health issues at work are an important component of wellbeing, as occupational stress and work-related mental health issues are the cause of many disruptions, such as loss of productivity and absenteeism (Harvey et al., 2014).====This study will fill a gap in the literature, and its findings will be highly relevant for policy and program development. First, the nature of work and the expectation of work among mature age workers may change as this group enters the pre-retirement period. Second, none of the previous literature has focused on mature age workers, despite evidence that this group of workers in Australia may be particularly prone to long period of underemployment. As highlighted in Li et al. (2015), which used data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (ABS (2012), mature age workers in Australia tend to be trapped in underemployment and have a longer average duration of underemployment than younger people. Although the rates of underemployment were highest among the younger age group of 15–24 years at 17.4 per cent compared to 7.5 per cent for the mature age workers 45–54 years and 6.5 per cent for the age group of 55 years or over in 2016, the rates of underemployment for people aged 45–54 years and those aged 55 years and over have been increasing in recent years (ABS, 2016a). Further, mature age workers in Australia generally have a longer duration of underemployment than younger people. The median durations of part-time underemployment in 2019 were 26 weeks for people aged 15–24, 32 weeks for people aged 25–34 and 48 weeks for people aged 35–44. These underemployment durations were lower than the 52 weeks median duration of underemployment among mature age workers aged 45–54 and 65.4 weeks among mature age workers aged 55–64 years (ABS, 2019). Further, while only less than one third of people aged 15–19 years who were underemployed (part-time) experienced insufficient work for one year or more, this duration was experienced by over half of those aged 55 years and over and 46 per cent of those aged 45–54 years (ABS, 2014).====Milner et al. (2015) examined the association between working less or more than standard full-time hours and mental health, while Otterbach et al. (2016) investigated the association between hours mismatch and mental health, but they did not focus on mature age workers. Thus, our study fills this gap and, to strengthen its contribution, it also includes, as a comparison, an investigation of the effects of work hour constraints on mental health among younger workers.====Second, with the exception of Otterbach et al. (2016), previous studies examining hours of work and mental health have mostly depended on short panel data and have not focused on the gap between the hours a person would like to work and the hours they usually work (in other words, the hours mismatch). Our study also takes into account the type of work that mature age workers do, including the demands of the work and the extent of employees’ decision making, particularly whether a person has control over their work.====Third, in terms of measurement, our study complements Otterbach et al. (2016), who used the reduced SF-12 form of the SF-36 questionnaire (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey) as the basis for their mental health measure while our study uses the SF-36, which is more comprehensive. We use four variants of the mental health components of the SF-36: mental health (symptoms related to anxiety and depression and measure of positive affect); role-emotional (interference with work or other daily activities due to emotional problems); social functioning (interference with normal social activities) as discussed in Butterworth and Crosier (2004); and vitality (energy and fatigue measures) as discussed in Brown et al. (2011).====This paper poses three research questions: Is working hours mismatch associated with mental health among mature age workers in Australia? What are the impacts of job strain on mental health? Are there any gender differences? We also examine how the findings about hours mismatch and job strain for older workers compare with the younger generation. We focus on the implication of hours mismatch and job strain on mental health. Exploration of factors that determine hours mismatch and job strain is beyond the scope of this paper.====The remaining sections are as follows. In Section 2, we present the literature review. Section 3 discusses data and methodology and patterns of mental health by gender. In Section 4 we discuss the results and draw out some policy implications.

This change may lead to a labour force characterized by older employees and older operational managers. This paper contributes to the existing literature on the effect of aging on firm performance by performing an explorative analysis of how the age of the operational manager and the age composition of employees relate to the survival of Swedish firms during 2004–2013. We observe that the relationship between the age of the operational manager and firm exit changes functional shape when separated into different firm-size categories. Additionally, the age of the operational manager tends to be more important for new firms compared to incumbents. The share of older employees is positively associated with firm survival.","In this paper, we conduct an explorative analysis of how the age of the operational manager and the age of employees relate to the survival of firms. It is well-known that aging affects the preferences, the values, the abilities, the performance, and the productivity of individuals with great implications for them as individuals, as family members, as members of various social networks, as entrepreneurs/operational managers, and as employees. What is less well-known is to what extent the age of entrepreneurs/operational managers and the age of employees influence the performance of firms and, in our case, the survival of firms across different size categories and across the lifecycle of the firm. Since survival is the ultimate performance measure for firms, we claim that it is interesting to discuss and to analyse the potential relationship between the age of the entrepreneur/operational manager, the age composition of the employees, and the survival of firms in general and across different size and age groups. The paper hereby addresses some of the potentially important future research issues in aging societies, mentioned in Bohlmann et al. (2018).====A limited number of studies have focused on how firm survival is affected by the age of managers and employees (Coad and Timmermans, 2014, Azoulay et al., 2018, Coad, 2018). Most studies have focused solely on entrepreneurs and have found that the survival rates of businesses established by older entrepreneurs are higher than the rates of those started by younger entrepreneurs (Cressy and Storey, 1995, Wagner and Sternberg, 2004, Mueller, 2006), which may be due to more extensive and more varied human capital, i.e., education and experience, superior networks, and a stronger financial situation (Arkebauer, 1995). Thus, there are ample reasons to assume that aging will influence the decision-making capabilities and skills of managers and the productivity of employees, and that both have a large potential to influence the performance of firms, including their survival. However, we cannot a priori know the direction of the effects and whether they are linear. The theoretical literature seems to support two main ideas: i) a positive influence of the age of managers on the survival probability of firms and ii) the existence of a threshold above which the positive impact is reversed. This paper adds to the existing literature by examining the survival of all firms, including firms of various size and age classes. In addition, we focus on the operational manager, not only on entrepreneurs, and the influence of the share of older employees on firm survival. The purpose of this paper is to make an explorative empirical contribution to the literature on the effects of aging populations on the survival of firms, where we in addition decipher the relationship by analysing different kinds of firms (depending on their size and age). We thereby contribute to the current discussion of the general economic effects of the demographic change that is currently happening in many developed countries.====To this end, Swedish microdata at the individual and firm level for the period 2004–2013 are used. The empirical design starts with descriptive statistics showing that firms with an operational manager (above 55 and 64 years of age) are more likely to survive. When estimating the relationship between the age of the operational manager and firm survival, the shape of the relationship differs among firms based on size and age categories. The age of the operational manager tends to be more important for small firms (up to ten employees) and for newly established firms. In relation to the age composition of employees, we observe that the share of older employees (above 55 and 64) overall reduces the probability that a firm will exit the market. This is an interesting and intriguing result at a time when firms in most developed countries have an increasing share of elderly individuals==== serving as both operational managers and employees. As the transformation of the demographic structure in the developed economies continues, this change is going to be even more pronounced among firms in the years to come. The findings in this paper thus emphasize the heterogenity across firms, i.e. of different size and age in regard to the relationship between the age of the operational manager and firm survival. Hence, there is no clear-cut answer regarding the benefits/disadvantages of having an older operational manager.====The paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 describes the conceptual background.

More concretely, the increases in wives’ ==== can explain 67% of the total change in husbands’ participation rates from 1995 to 2016. Moreover, during the years of the GFC (2008–2013) and without this effect, the participation rate of Spanish older men would have decreased below 57%, almost 8 percentage points less than the value actually reached.====The findings that emerge from our study suggest that economic policy should consider opening up a further avenue of action, one which does not tend to be envisaged, and which, in the case of Spain, is absent from recent legal reform, namely, targeting not only the individual but also the whole family unit of older persons as a legal goal.","After a lengthy period during which over 54-year-olds in most OECD countries tended to reduce their involvement in the labour market, there has been a significant increase in labour market participation since the mid-late 1990s. This trend has also been evident in Spain and has implications for so-called ==== which, from the sociolabour perspective, involves the capacity of older individuals to remain in the labour market, wherein they offer their key labour and life experience and help to alleviate public rent-sharing systems.====The reasons underlying this shift in older male worker participation have been the focus of much attention in the economic literature, and explanations for said change have been based on the supply and demand side.==== The former of these two perspectives seems to have emerged as the most relevant and has, in this regard, been the subject of the greatest focus in the literature. More specifically, of all the factors operating from the supply side of the equation, among the group we are concerned with, the following four drivers have played a major role.====First, the change that has taken place in the formative profiles of the older labour force would seem to provide one of the key reasons explaining why the working life of individuals in this group is now longer. The most-trained workers participate more in the labour market because they receive higher emoluments and their jobs tend to demand fewer physical requirements. This phenomenon has been studied by, among others, Goldin and Katz, 2007, Kuhn and Lozano, 2008 in the United States and by Pérez and Carrascal, 2010, Pérez et al., 2015, Pérez et al., 2016 in Spain. These latter works conclude that for Spanish males aged 55 to 64 years living with a partner, holding a university degree increases their likelihood of remaining in the labour market by 23 percentage points and by over 30 percentage points in the case of individuals with postgraduate studies compared with having only a basic education.====Second, the health status of the group analysed seems to have a critical bearing on their decision either to remain in the labour market or to leave, as highlighted in a studies such as Coile (2004a), Siegel (2006) or Schirle (2007). In Spain, Álvarez et al. (2002) highlighted how leaving employment as a result of illness or disability tends to lead to the decision to retire, to take up another type of inactivity, or to devote oneself to homemaking in the case of women. Nevertheless, as asserted by García-Gómez et al. (2018), if the purpose is to explain the increase in the participation rates of elderly males after the mid-1990s, there does not seem to have been any substantial change in the health status of the group analysed that would account for such a phenomenon.====Third, factors are linked to how easier or more difficult the social security system makes it to leave the labour market and how generous pensions are or what reductions may be imposed therein as a result of taking early retirement. Such relations have been widely explored (Gustman and Steinmeier, 2009, Blau and Goodstein, 2010, the USA; Hanel and Riphahn, 2012, of Switzerland; Queiroz and Souza, 2017, for Brazil; Peracchi et al., 2002, Cairó Blanco, 2010, García-Pérez et al., 2013, García-Gómez and Jiménez-Martín, 2018, García-Gómez et al., 2018 for Spain).====The public pension system in Spain is a defined-benefit pay-as-you-go system. Although there is no legal retirement age, the ‘normal’ age in force for most of the period in question was 65 years, although it should be considered that the system has undergone reforms since 1997, which we summarize as follows.==== In 1997, there was a gradual increase from 8 to 15 in the number of years used to compute the pension, coupled with a reduction in the amounts paid. However, the penalisation for early retirees aged between 60 and 65 years decreased by 1 percentage point, provided that they had been paying contributions for at least 40 years. In 2002, the possibility of taking early retirement at 61 was made widely available and partial retirement schemes compatible with individuals remaining in employment were promoted. Certain incentives to retire for individuals aged over 65 years were also introduced.====These incentives were intensified in the 2007 reform, when the penalisation for early retirement (i.e., under the normal age of 65 years) was reduced by half of 1 percentage point.====The reform implemented in 2011 was framed within an extremely adverse economic context for the Spanish economy, such that the measures introduced, to a large degree, attempted to alleviate the burden on the system by reducing the generosity of the pension system. A gradual increase in the statutory eligibility age from 65 to 67 years was established, the number of years used to calculate the pension was increased from 15 to 25, and the conditions for early retirement were made stricter. The latest reform took place in 2013. This reform was an effort to introduce a sustainability factor (SF) linking the initial pension level to life expectancy and a pension revaluation index that would separate the automatic revaluation of pensions from the consumer price index (CPI). By 2018, the elements defining this latest reform were suspended: the application of the SF was set at a date no later than 1 January 2023, and the revalorization index (RI) was not applied to pension increases for 2018 and 2019, which reverted to being linked to the CPI.====Notably, studies carried out in Spain highlight how the reforms undertaken prior to 2011 have, at most, played a marginal role in the shift in the trend in the participation rates of elderly males in Spain.==== If we analyse the effective retirement age in Spain, we observed how this settled at approximately 64.2 years after 2013.====Fourth and last, one variable that may prove relevant in elderly males’ participation decisions is the decision taken by their wives or civil partners==== to remain in the labour market. This factor seems to play a particularly prominent role among legally registered older couples and specifically implies that the decision of one member to participate in (retire from) the labour market may lead the other member to reflect on their own situation. Hypothetically, there are two theoretical channels through which this double interaction might operate. That is, using Coile’s terminology, (Coile, 2004b) there are two types of ‘spillover effects’: an income effect and an effect working through the complementarity between each spouse’s leisure time (i.e. the shared leisure effect).====The income effect simply states that if one spouse’s labour earnings increase as a consequence of his/her labour market participation, the other spouse will experience an increase in his/her nonlabour income because the household shares both spouses’ incomes. If leisure time is assumed a normal ‘good’, the neoclassical model of labour supply would predict a decline in the labour participation of the latter spouse. Alternatively, the shared leisure effect affirms that one spouse’s increase in leisure time will augment the marginal value of leisure for the other partner, making more likely his/her disengagement from the labour market. Thus, if the income effect were stronger than the shared leisure effect, we expect to observe in our data that the likelihood of remaining in the labour market for a husband with a retired wife would be higher than that of a husband with a participating partner. By contrast, if the prevailing effect were the shared leisure effect (as is the case), we should find in our data a higher likelihood of participating in the labour market for husbands with an active spouse compared with that of the husbands with a spouse out of the labour force.====In this regard, international evidence has suggested that the members of a couple prefer to make a joint decision regarding whether to retire (Blau, 1998; Maestas, 2001; Coile, 2004b; Chalmers and Milan, 2005; Stancanelli and van Soest, 2012; Honoré and de Paula, 2013; Hospido and Zamarro, 2014; Syse et al., 2014; De Preter et al., 2015; Radl and Himmelreicher, 2015 and Warren, 2015). This phenomenon leads to the predominance of the so-called ==== or ‘====, which is particularly noticeable in formally established couples and implies that the labour participation decision (retirement) of one of the members may trigger a mirror effect in the other. The work of Schirle (2008) focused specifically on evaluating this effect in three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The author stated that it is extremely relevant because it accounts for between one third and one half of the recent increases in participation in these countries in the group of older males living with a partner. In Spain, Pérez et al., 2015, Pérez et al., 2016 also contrasted (for the period 2001–2009) the relevance of the ====, according to which the likelihood of an older male remaining in the labour market increases by between 11 and 17 percentage points, ====, (depending on the specification) if their partner also remains in the active population====.====The first innovation offered in this work is that it considers the whole of the period throughout which this phenomenon took place, namely, the last two decades. To this end, we used a broad sample of microdata spanning every year from 1995 to 2016. As a result, in addition to being able to measure the trend globally, we were also able to ascertain how the ==== behaved during the economic and financial crisis (GFC), which had such a profound impact on our labour market. In this sense, we found for the whole period that the presence of a wife in the labour force increases the husband’s likelihood of participating by between 11 and 20.6 percentage points. That effect not only held firm during the GFC but that it increased, because the corresponding marginal effects for these years fluctuated between 11.4 and 21.8 percentage points. The second innovation of this paper is that we conducted a nonlinear decomposition of the whole effect that allowed us to determine which aspect, the shared leisure effect or the personal characteristics, was more important to explain the participation rate of the older males. We found that the increases in wives’ labour force participation explained 67% of the total change in husbands’ participation rates from 1995 to 2016.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 offers a descriptive approach of how older individuals’ participation has evolved in the OECD as a whole, and specifically in Spain. Section 3 discusses the basic lines of labour participation models in the family and presents the empirical strategy. The fourth section describes the sample used. Section 5 presents with the estimations, and section 6 presents the decomposition of the effects. Section 7 discusses economic policy implications.

We use harmonized longitudinal survey data from the United States, China, and 13 countries in Europe, and follow the ==== design of Dobkin et al. (2018) to estimate dynamic effects of a hospitalization on out-of-pocket health expenditures, labor market outcomes, social insurance payments, and household income. We find distinctly different patterns across countries. In contrast to the United States, where hospitalizations lead to large health expenditures and decreases in earnings, individuals in Northern and Southern Europe are largely protected from negative economic outcomes. Hospitalizations in China lead to even larger out-of-pocket expenditures as a percent of prior income, but do not negatively affect labor market outcomes. Our results largely align with the differences in generosity across countries in social protection institutions that include health systems, social security programs and labor market regulations.","Work in later life is often a crucial period for building retirement savings. Fresh evidence on life-cycle wage growth across countries shows that wages peak around the age of 50 across many countries, though life-cycle wage growth is steeper in rich than in poor countries (Lagakos et al., 2018). This period of working life is also much more susceptible to health shocks. For example, 45-64 year olds are 33% more likely to have an overnight hospitalization than 20-44 year olds (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). Health shocks not only pose immediate medical expenditure risk, but also have a wide range of economic consequences on jobs, earnings, and household finances. In the United States, for example, Dobkin et al. (2018) document that the latter economic costs associated with hospital admission can overshadow the immediate cost of out-of-pocket medical spending. While health insurance provides protection against medical expenditure risk, protection against downstream labor market consequences rests with other types of insurance programs, including disability, sick pay, and retirement programs. As many countries around the world grapple with how to design these programs, it is particularly important to understand the economic consequences of shocks late in life under various institutional settings.====In this paper, we document the economic consequences of health shocks among older workers across countries using micro-level data to gain insights into how institutional and policy factors affect economic outcomes. To do this, we use the Harmonized Health and Retirement Study family of surveys consolidated by the Gateway to Global Ageing Data. Our core sample includes the United States between 2000 and 2014 from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), 13 European countries between 2007 and 2015 from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which we group into Northern Europe, Southern Europe, and Western Europe, and China between 2010 and 2014 from the China Health and Retirement Survey (CHARLS). This set of countries provides an interesting comparison set because, one, as we will discuss shortly, major types of health systems are represented by the countries in our sample; and two, our sample covers countries of different income levels and at different stages of development.====Our empirical strategy uses an event study approach around discrete health shocks. Following Dobkin et al. (2018), we examine the effects of six economic outcomes, including out-of-pocket medical expenditures, respondent earnings, spousal earnings, work status, social insurance payments, and total household income, for older workers aged between 50 and 59 who have health insurance coverage. We exploit the panel nature of each dataset to estimate these effects for several years after the hospitalization relative to a pre-trend in these outcomes prior to hospitalization.====We find distinctly different patterns around the world. In Northern and Southern Europe, out-of-pocket medical expenses do not rise significantly upon a hospital admission, suggesting that the (universal) healthcare systems in these countries insure individuals well against typical medical costs associated with a hospital admission. Moreover, while there is a gradual decline in income that begins several years before the hospitalization event, there is no significant drop in total income after the hospitalization from this trend. In contrast, hospitalizations in Western Europe and the United States lead to significant and persistent out-of-pocket medical costs and significant declines in earnings and employment. Social insurance payments significantly increase, and while it is enough to offset the earnings decline in Western Europe, it is not in the United States and thus total income significantly declines in the years following a hospitalization (as shown in Dobkin et al. (2018)). In China, out-of-pocket medical expenses increase substantially after a hospitalization, but earnings do not fall.====To understand whether some of these estimated effects are driven by differential admission to hospitals that may be correlated with later economic outcomes, we also examine the effects of hospitalization on health outcomes. Indeed, we find that self-reported work limitations and health status appear to be worse in the United States and Western Europe following a hospitalization, which may help explain the more pronounced negative labor market effects in these countries.====These patterns can also be interpreted to some degree in light of the institutional differences across countries. For medical costs, Northern and Southern Europe have relatively generous social health insurance programs that protect individuals from most of the cost of a hospitalization, unlike in the United States and in China where health insurance programs have lower coverage rates. Analogously, European countries typically have more generous disability and sick pay programs and stronger labor market protection that may help cushion potential difficulties in returning to work after a hospitalization. Using country-wide data on the social protections for health, disability, and work, we find evidence that in countries where the government plays a larger and more active role in these protections, the effects of hospitalizations on out-of-pocket health expenditures are smaller, and in countries with stronger employment protections the negative effect on earnings is also dampened. These results largely align with the cross-regional differences in our main analysis and the institutional details characterizing these regions.====Our results add to a growing empirical literature on the link between health and economic activities over the life-cycle (see Prinz et al., 2018, Currie and Madrian, 1999 for reviews). Earlier work in this area measured effects of changes in a variety of health measures on consumption, earnings, and medical costs in the United States (e.g., Cochrane, 1991, Smith, 2005), while more recent studies often focus on sharper health “shocks” such as hospitalizations, use rich structural models, incorporate administrative data, and evaluate effects in other countries (Dobkin et al. (2018) and De Nardi et al. (2018) in the United States, Garcia-Gómez et al. (2017) in the Netherlands, Parro and Pohl (2018) in Chile). Much of this work finds large effects of hospitalization on earnings. We contribute to this literature by examining the effects of hospitalizations on economic outcomes in a variety of countries using harmonized data and methods.====This paper also contributes to the literature on international comparisons of health (see Banks and Smith (2011) for a review). As argued in Kapteyn (2010), cross-country comparisons can be a useful way to evaluate the effects of institutions and policies, which can vary dramatically across countries but less so within countries. However, many previous studies making international comparisons rely on datasets and/or identification strategies that are only loosely comparable. This makes credible comparisons across countries difficult because variation across countries may simply be due to different econometric assumptions, sampling frames, or question wording. Using the Gateway to Global Ageing Data allows us to use the same estimation strategy on datasets that were specifically designed to mirror the HRS in the United States, though of course such a design cannot completely eliminate concerns over comparability. This hopefully provides more confidence that differences in results across countries are due to economic, institutional, and cultural differences between countries rather than data or methodological differences.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the health and social insurance systems in the United States, Europe, and China.

Historically, such needs were essentially handled within the family; however, the growth of the welfare state, in its various guises, led to the gradual substitution of these intergenerational arrangements by the market and by public transfers. In today’s social welfare systems, the working-age population provides economic resources for both the young – in terms of education and family support – and the elderly – in terms of financing pensions, health and long-term care systems. These exchanges are the result of the extending of welfare state action over the past century from mere poverty reduction to broader programs that provide merit or social goods (primarily education and health) and which secure income in the face of adversity (i.e. unemployment and disability insurances) or during old-age (i.e. pension systems).====It is worth noting that the degree of substitution (‘crowding-out’) of intergenerational private transfers by public transfers and the age composition of such transfers vary markedly within the countries that share the European social model (Albertini, 2016).==== Interestingly, the growing tendency to focus public policies on the needs of the elderly, as identified in different strands of the literature (Preston, 1984; Coder et al., 1989, Fuchs and Reklis, 1992, Folbre, 1994, Vanhuysse, 2013), is often overlooked. This trend has been associated with the population ageing process and the increasing political power of the elderly in representative democracies; however, the reasons underpinning it cannot be reduced to simple demographic forces. Countries have reacted differently to the common demographic transition, motivated by their specific national institutional arrangements and by policy inertia (Esping-Andersen and Sarasa, 2002). The extent to which this shift in public resources to the elderly challenges the distributive norms inherent to the social welfare system remains open to debate. In short, the age composition of transfers in a society can be seen as a reflection of the choices between alternative schemes for distributing resources to individuals, challenged by demographic and socioeconomic change.====Historical and current analyses of private and public transfers and of the market, and their respective roles in ensuring welfare, require a considerable amount and diversity of data, conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied by a single data set. Moreover, they require longitudinal – generational – observations not only of monetary transfers, but also of transfers in-kind. An enlightened approximation to the question is offered by Mason and Lee (2011), who describe the ==== as “the social institutions and economic mechanisms used by each generation or age group to produce, consume, share, and save”. In the framework of the interdisciplinary research project, National Transfer Accounts (NTA), a comprehensive method for measuring the flow of transfers between different age groups has been developed, with the corresponding dataset. More specifically, NTA provides estimates of how the working-age population finances the needs of dependents (primarily children and the elderly) by resorting to the three, so-called, “welfare pillars” (Esping-Andersen, 2002): markets, families and government. This dataset greatly improves our ability to analyse the challenges that the European social model faces.====In recent decades, population ageing and the economic downturn have combined to change redistribution needs and the intergenerational balance. The crisis initiated in 2008, the start of what would become known as the ‘Great Recession’, created a temporary scarcity in the working population that can provide insights into the future consequences of the ageing process. Regarded as the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, there is a vast body of literature dedicated to analysing both its causes and effects. Using historical data, Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) showed that the aftermaths of severe financial crises have three characteristics in common: a prolonged collapse of asset prices (especially housing), a marked fall in both output and employment and, finally, a veritable explosion in public debt. And, indeed, all three circumstances manifested themselves in the Great Recession, albeit with notable differences across countries. Looking beyond the strictly macroeconomic consequences of the Great Recession, several papers have also considered its effects on social welfare. For example, Deaton (2012) performed an insightful analysis of its impact on the subjective well-being of Americans while Somarriba-Arechavala et al. (2015) undertook a cross-country analysis of the variation presented by different quality of life indicators in the EU between 2007 and 2011. The latter confirm that in most countries – and more especially those of Southern and Eastern Europe – the crisis has had a severe impact on both economic indicators (low per capita income, high unemployment and income inequality) and social conditions (social exclusion, trust in public institutions, racial tension, etc.), making the Great Recession a truly ====.====This article analyses the impact of the Great Recession by ages and reviews the arguments that underpin intergenerational redistribution to examine the Spanish case. The structure of intergenerational transfers in Spain and their evolution during the crisis provide the backdrop for testing the compatibility of specific policy outcomes with these arguments. We employ the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) methodology to perform an in-depth analysis of the situation in Spain, one of the European countries hit hardest by the economic downturn. In ‘Empirical evidence: the unbalanced welfare state’ we present the empirical evidence available for various countries around the world and, in ‘What justifications are there for an asymmetric intergenerational redistribution?’, we review the arguments forwarded to account for the bias observed towards the elderly in their welfare state policies. In ‘Methodological framework: National Transfer Accounts’, we provide an overview of the NTA method and outline the data used to construct the NTA for Spain 2012. The results reported in ‘Analysing the impact of the crisis by age in Spain’ confirm that the level of protection provided to children during the crisis was undermined. This can be attributed to the weak family policies implemented in Spain, which failed to mitigate the sharp drop in labour income resulting from unemployment and wage reductions. Finally, ‘Conclusions’ concludes and we raise the question as to why high-income societies appear so averse to old-age poverty while they seemingly accept child poverty almost without flinching.",Protecting the elderly and children in times of crisis: An analysis based on National Transfer Accounts,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X19300957,10 October 2019,2019,Research Article,110.0

We examine and compare levels and determinants of financial literacy as well as its association with asset allocation among middle-aged and older individuals of Japan and the United States. We present some interesting findings. First, financial literacy is generally influenced by educational attainment, cognitive skills, coursework in economics or ====, and income level. Second, financial literacy is associated with household asset allocation; individuals with higher literacy also have investment in stocks or securities. These patterns are commonly observed both in Japan and the United States.","Financial literacy holds growing interest for managing assets/savings during the longer retirement period currently experienced in rapidly aging countries. Indeed, the case is pronounced in and relevant to Japan, where population aging is taking place at the most rapid rate in the world in an environment that combines a persistent long-term low level fertility rate and continuing rise in life expectancy.==== These factors have resulted in the older generation occupying a higher proportion of the total population at 27.3% while putting pressure on the sustainability of the pay-as-you-go public pension program (Shimizutani et al. 2016).====Under these circumstances, there are two forces that act to lower the adequacy of retirement savings and thus obstruct the management of economic resources in later life for middle-aged and older individuals. One is a reduction in the amount of pension benefits to receive and the other is a longer time horizon that has to be compensated. A higher level of individual financial literacy may serve as a device to ensure economic well-being or even enhance the standard of living at older ages.====Research on financial literacy has developed significantly since the 2000 s (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014) for the U.S. and other Western countries, but is still relatively scarce in Japan. Currently a widely used, standard measure of financial literacy is the number of correct answers to a 3-question quiz inquiring about compound interest, inflation, and risk/diversification. These questions were first asked in 2004 in the Health and Retirement Study.====Using these and other metrics of financial literacy, Lusardi and Mitchell (2014) conclude that in the U.S. the level of financial literacy is low. Moreover, the low level of financial literacy is found to be prevalent in other countries including Japan (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011b). When looking at the data by subgroup, the level of financial literacy is hump-shaped along with age and is higher for males, the educated, employed individuals, or those who are higher earners. Furthermore, a large volume of empirical research documented that the standard measure of financial literacy is indeed associated with a variety of financial decisions or economic behaviors such as stock market participation (van Rooij et al., 2011) and retirement saving (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007), and financial literacy is confirmed to play a non-negligible role in those decisions/behaviors if instrument variable (IV) estimation is employed to address endogeneity.====This study examines factors influencing financial literacy and the association of financial literacy with household financial decisions among middle-aged and older individuals aged 52–79. Using harmonized micro-level data, we perform parallel analyses in Japan and the U.S., highlighting differences and similarities between the two countries as far as empirical findings are concerned. Research on financial literacy in Japan has been relatively scarce, let alone studies of individuals approaching or entering retirement age. Because of the demographic and economic changes mentioned above, understanding heterogeneity in financial literacy and decision-making within this segment of the population is especially important and a major contribution of this paper.====Among the few previous studies, Clark et al. (2013) revealed that a higher level of financial literacy is found in males, residents in urban areas, the higher educated, or high income earners in Japan.==== The study utilized a micro-level dataset on individuals from the 2010 National Survey on Work and Family, focusing on individuals in the sample who were aged 40 to 59 and employed at the time of the survey. Furthermore, they found that financial literacy is partially linked with the demand for human capital investment, measured by the need for additional skills to be competitive at the current job.==== As regards financial literacy for younger individuals, Cameron et al. (2013) showed that financial literacy is higher among Japanese high school students than in the U.S. and New Zealand. In a more recent work, Yoshino et al. (2017) used a dataset collected by the Central Council for Financial Service Information, which is not based on a standard two stage random sampling, to examine factors influencing financial literacy and the relationship between financial literacy and household asset allocation. While the data used by Yoshino et al. (2017) contains rich variables related with financial literacy, they are not internationally comparable and thus are not suitable for an international comparison study.====This study performs two sets of analysis: the first is on the factors that influence financial literacy and the second is the association between financial literacy and household asset allocation. Our contribution to the literature features two new enhancements. First, we perform a Japan-U.S. comparison using internationally standardized datasets. While we share the spirit of the analytical approach with Yoshino et al. (2017), we use world-standard longitudinal datasets on the middle-aged and older individuals, namely Japanese Study on Aging and Retirement (JSTAR) for Japan, and Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for the U.S. These surveys are “sisters” in international harmonization efforts for studies on population aging, and most of the variables collected, including the three metrics of financial literacy, are standardized across countries. Thus, these datasets are most suitable for a Japan-U.S. comparison in financial literacy, as described in the next section. Second, this paper advances the research in Japan. We focus on middle-aged and older individuals aged 52 to 79 who are sensitive to retirement preparation or who are indeed retired. Moreover, we include some new variables as covariates which were not included in the previous literature in Japan, specifically, measures of cognitive ability and experience of taking an economics/accounting coursework.==== We believe that these additional variables will help to uncover a more accurate assessment of the impact of socio-economic status on financial literacy or household asset allocation.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset used in the empirical analysis and presents descriptive statistics of financial literacy. Section 3 performs regression analysis to associate the level of financial literacy with a variety of factors including household demographics, socio-economic status, and measures of cognitive ability, and so on. Further, Section 4 investigates the relationship between financial literacy and household asset allocation.

Happiness is found to increase in the period after divorce for both men and women. We show that this pattern goes through a decrease in stress and financial hardship.","Research has recently focused on understanding the consequences of divorce and separation for former spouses’ well-being (see Gumà et al. (2015) for a recent contribution for European countries and Clark et al. (2008) for an analysis on the impact of life and labour market events on well-being in Germany). While there is general consensus in recognizing that marital dissolution can potentially generate uneasiness in an individual’s life (Amato, 2000), scholars also recognize the need to better understand the heterogeneity of outcomes according to individuals’ and couples’ characteristics (Amato, 2010), its evolution over time (Bauer et al., 2015, Clark and Georgellis, 2013, Rudolf and Kang, 2011), and the channels driving such detrimental effect.====In this paper we investigate the well-being variations associated with divorce and the possible channels contributing to this relationship by means of a retrospective panel based on the third wave of SHARE, called SHARELIFE, covering 14 European countries. This retrospective panel has been constructed along the lines of Brugiavini et al. (2013). Individuals interviewed in the third wave of SHARE contribute to the retrospective panel with as many observations as their years of age. The dataset will then cover a wide range of countries and a long time span.====Well-being is an intrinsically multidimensional concept typically measured by self-evaluations. In order to analyze genuine variations of well-being across individuals, it is crucial to account for differences in response styles (Bertoni, 2015, Angelini et al., 2014): conditional on actual circumstances, individuals might approach survey questions differently. Due to their innate characteristics and their life-time history, they might use different benchmarks when assessing their condition and attach the same level of well-being to different self-evaluations. Such heterogeneity in reporting styles complicates any attempt to elicit actual variations in well-being from self-evaluation comparisons. Using a retrospective, cross-country panel dataset is particularly suitable to analyze the relationship between well-being and divorce net of several confounding factors, including those related with response style heterogeneity.====First, the longitudinal structure of the data allows to implement fixed-effects panel data models to control for unobservable time-invariant characteristics, such as personality traits, potentially correlated with both well-being and marriage dissolution (Roberts et al., 2007). Moreover, Diener and Suh (2000) argue that comparability of well-being evaluations might be challenged by cross-country heterogeneity in the prevailing societal values. Individual fixed effects sweep out differences in response styles due to social norms in the country of birth and country of residence at the moment of the interview. A third type of bias is produced by the cultural values that individuals have been exposed to due to their migration histories involving other countries (in addition to that of birth and the one where they are currently living) or by the norms that were prevailing in the country in which they were living at the time of divorce. In a standard panel, migrants typically are not followed throughout their life, while the retrospective nature of the data at hand delivers us full migration histories of a representative sample of the over 50 population in Europe (Antonova et al., 2014). In all our specifications we will control for a full set of country of residence dummies to remove any bias related with cultural connotations in happiness evaluations embedded in individuals as a result of their migration histories. On top of reporting styles concerns, allowing for full migration trajectories is also important to control for cross-country heterogeneity in societal attitudes towards divorce, which might affect the actual decision of interrupting the family relationship. The retrospective nature of our data allows to observe how individuals’ migration histories interweave with the evolution of their family relationships.====The richness of SHARELIFE data and the length of the retrospective panel also make it possible to include in our specifications a wide set of additional time-varying explanatory variables, such as number of children, physical health, labour market participation, unemployment and job industry, as well as to control for their variation along the life-cycle. Whereas these characteristics are clearly important well-being determinants, they are also expected to influence the decision of divorcing by shaping the social inclusion of individuals after the end of the family relationship. All in all, our dataset proposes to be a powerful tool to analyze the consequences of life course events on well-being.====We estimate fixed-effects linear regression models and show that for both men and women well-being reduces in the year of divorce. Nevertheless, the correlation between divorce and well-being is not likely to show up only in the year in which the divorce takes place. Anticipatory variations can be motivated by the fact that marriage dissolution is likely not to be an unexpected shock but the end of a period during which marriage life deteriorates and partners well-being is negatively affected by this process. Moreover, divorce is a key life-course event and its consequences might propagate over time. Based on a subsample of divorcees we show that, as divorce approaches, happiness decreases significantly for women and after divorce well-being improves for both genders.====Once ascertained that well-being significantly varies with divorce, it becomes relevant to understand the channels according to which this relationship materializes. The SHARELIFE questionnaire asks respondents to declare whether they experienced particular periods of financial hardship or stress. Financial hardship rises until the year of divorce and then decreases. We also find that in the years before divorce the incidence of stressful period increases. This is because divorce is typically the epilogue of a long period of within family tensions, discussions and uneasiness. After divorce, former partners experience a significant relief from stress. The improvements in happiness after divorce match the contemporaneous lower probability of experiencing stress episodes and the improvement in the financial situation with respect to year of divorce. This way, stress and financial hardship propose as part of the mechanism according to which divorce and well-being result to be correlated.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe in details the retrospective dataset and the key variables we use in our analysis. In Section 3 we present the econometric model and discuss the empirical evidence.

We conduct a linear regression in order to isolate factors influencing hospital costs and length of stay.====The mean length of stay (SD) for older patients (65+) is 11 days (18.17) and the mean hospitalisation cost (SD) €6706 (9422). The main predictor of hospital costs is the length of stay. A linear regression (n = 41,348, R==== = 0.4520) reveals that predictors of a longer LOS for hospitalised older patients are: to be a male, to come from another hospital, to be sent to hospital by a general practitioner, to be admitted through the emergency department, to undergo a surgical procedure, to suffer from a major or extreme SOI or run a major or extreme mortality risk, to have a high score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), to stay in an ICU, to belong to older age categories (85+), and to be institutionalised after discharge.====Advanced age is by itself only a weak predictor of hospital cost, but it is a good predictor of a longer hospital stay.","In the scientific literature, older people are generally defined as persons aged 65 and over (Sabharwal et al., 2015, Orimo et al., 2006). Some key indicators, such as the increase in average age, life expectancy, proportion of population aged 65 and over, or the ratio of old people to very old people, all emphasise that the Belgian population is ageing (Sanderson and Scherbov, 2008). More specifically, we have noticed an ‘ageing in the ageing’, since the most spectacular increase concerns very old people, aged 85 and over (Vilpert et al., 2013). According to the Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Centre (KCE), the share of very old hospitalised patients (85+) will most probably continue to grow in the coming decades (Van Den Bosch et al., 2011). Scientific articles dedicated to the study of hospital populations currently concentrate on oldest old patients, aged 80 or 85 and over (Vieillissement de la population et évolution de l’activité hospitalière, 2015, Brandão et al., 2017, Goebeler et al., 2004, Melzer et al., 2015). Other studies have pointed out that, besides age, clinical profiles and physical abilities have to be taken into account to describe older or oldest old patients (Orimo et al., 2006).====Population ageing constitutes a serious challenge for our health care system (Brandão et al., 2017, Bogaert and Bains, 2003, Jeandel and Vigouroux, 2015, Ruiz et al., 2015) and will have a serious impact on total health care costs (Ha et al., 2014). Some studies indicate that health expenses correlate with age (Maisonneuve et al., 2013) and reach a peak around 85 years (Bogaert and Bains, 2003). However, those studies have concentrated on total health expenditure; they have not precisely analysed the cost of ageing for the hospital as an institution. The proportion of older patients (65+) in hospitals is high (Ruiz et al., 2015, Vieillissement de la population et évolution de l’activité hospitalière, 2015, Brandão et al., 2017, Goebeler et al., 2004, Melzer et al., 2015). In 2015, 27% of hospitalised patients in Belgium were aged 75 and over, totalling 43% of patient days in acute care (non-geriatric) (Deschodt, et al., 2015). In 2014, there were 1,697,084 hospital stays (all ages), amounting to a mean cost for the Belgian social security system of €4986.66 per stay (Feedback financier par pathologie, 2014).====Old inpatients (65+) are intensive users of acute care; they are usually associated with a higher risk of admission through the emergency department (Vilpert et al., 2013, Melzer et al., 2015) and with a longer hospital stay. The diversity of diseases and the number of comorbidities complicate the profiles of old inpatients; potentially, this could lead to an increased utilisation of hospital resources (Ruiz et al., 2015).====Some studies have identified the determinants of costs and length of stay for hospitals. However, there are large differences among the populations studied as regards variables and types of care (inpatient and/or outpatient care) included in models, and also between the cost perspectives adopted by these studies (societal, hospital-centred, or patient-centred). In Belgium, little research has been conducted on the medico-administrative variables that have an impact on the overall hospital cost for old inpatients (65+). However, today such research seems essential for hospitals because the Belgian government has set up a project setting out to reform the financing of hospitals (De Block, 2015). The reform, which is to be introduced in 2019, plans a lump sum per Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) per hospital for some pathologies with low variability (some All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups (APR-DRGs) with Severity Of Illness (SOI) 1 or 2). Other APR-DRGs with higher severities will continue to be paid by the existing financing system, i.e. with a fee-for-service for the medical activity. In this context, it would be interesting to understand whether age influences hospitalisation costs, in order to know whether this variable should be integrated into the new hospital financing system.====The objectives of this research are (i) to describe the medico-administrative profiles of inpatients aged 65 and over and (ii) to determine the main hospitalisation-related diseases in order (iii) to assess and identify predictors of hospital costs and length of stay thanks to data collected in hospital administrative databases.",Profile of hospitalised elderly patients in Belgium—Analysis of factors affecting hospital costs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X19300969,10 October 2019,2019,Research Article,113.0

In this paper, we use harmonized, cross-national survey data from the Health and Retirement Study, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, and the English ","The death of a spouse frequently imposes a large financial shock. In addition to loss of the decedent’s work or pension earnings, the last year of life for older adults is often characterized by high levels of healthcare utilization and spending. This can significantly reduce household wealth available for survivors through the direct costs of healthcare, informal care, home modifications, and other goods and services related to health deterioration; lost income from the decedent and caregivers who changed work behavior; and an accumulation of unpaid bills (Fan and Zick, 2004, Kelley et al., 2015, Lundberg et al., 2003, Weir et al., 2002). In addition, many households fail to take precautionary actions such as designating a second point of contact for routine financial transactions, purchasing life insurance, or providing information about the value and location of all accounts and assets. Relatively high rates of poverty among widows who were not poor during marriage are well documented in the United States (Bernheim et al., 2003, Bound et al., 1991, Hurd and Wise, 1989, McGarry and Schoeni, 2005, Weir et al., 2002) and Europe (Bíró, 2013, Dewilde, 2012, Hungerford, 2001).====A number of public policy and private market solutions exist to protect survivors’ well-being. Life insurance and legal services can be purchased to ensure stability for spouses (Bernheim et al., 2003). Governments can adopt policies that protect surviving spouses through default rules about disposition of the home and other assets and/or shift the balance of old-age pension payments to smooth payments over a couple’s life expectancy rather than an individual worker’s (Dewilde, 2012, Gillen and Kim, 2009).====In this paper, we use harmonized survey data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) to describe cross-national patterns of will use, spousal inheritance policies, and widows’ (and widowers’) retained wealth following a spouse’s death. We examine whether wills provide financial protection and whether this varies in countries with more versus less favorable spousal asset retention policies. While previous studies have examined intergenerational inheritances and household wealth cross-nationally (Semyonov and Lewin-Epstein, 2013), our study is the first to our knowledge to consider spousal will use in this context.====The cross-national, harmonized HRS/SHARE/ELSA data not only allow us to compare households before and after the death of a spouse, but provide key details about whether the decedent had a will and how the estate was settled. These data are well-suited to our research design because sampling occurs at the household level, thus we are able to follow widows and widowers after their spouses die. We take advantage of rarely used will data collected during posthumous “Exit” interviews conducted with next-of-kin proxy informants following the death of a sample member. We use these data in conjunction with characteristics of each country’s family inheritance policies to describe will use and bequest patterns in the United States and Europe.====We collect spousal inheritance policies for the 20 countries in our study and use the full cohort of decedents to characterize the median spousal inheritance share in each country net of potentially endogenous decisions about family composition or asset allocation. Analysis of the pre- and post-mortem cross-national survey data in conjunction with these measures of policy generosity yields several key points about will use and widow(er) financial well-being. First, households at all levels of wealth frequently do not prepare financial wills, even when they anticipate leaving bequests. Second, there is significant cross-national variation in both use of wills and default spousal inheritance regimes. Third, the vast majority of will-writers include their spouses, and these spouses retain more wealth on average than those whose spouses died intestate or were excluded from a will.","Wills, public policy, and financial well-being among surviving spouses",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X19300982,1 October 2019,2019,Research Article,114.0

With economic development, progress by women in the work force has lowered care levels. If levels should fall below the minimum care level for elderly parents, then children might enter into insurance contracts and even demand provision of long-term elderly care by the state. Such a change in elderly care provision is consistent with predictions that have been presented in the literature. As a further examination of this topic, this paper presents the conjecture that, as wage rates rise further, children will provide sufficient elderly care to parents by purchasing market care services.","Population aging and recent social trends reflecting a declining role of family solidarity are expected to generate mounting demands on markets for elderly long-term care and on the state to provide alternatives to families.====The gap separating life expectancy and healthy life expectancy tends to increase as life expectancy increases.==== The proportion of people aged 80 and over, most of whom need long-term (elderly) care, has increased in economically developed countries from about 2 percent in the 1970s to about 4 percent and higher in the 2010s.==== Moreover, recent declines in family solidarity are exacerbated by children’s mobility and a particular increase in childless families. Furthermore, increases in female labor force participation rates put more pressure on families to care for their dependent parents. Especially, female labor force participation rates are important if daughters and daughters-in-law typically play an important role in providing informal care. Female labor participation rates in OECD countries have increased in past decades, from about 50 percent in the 1970s to 70 percent and higher in the 2010s.==== When designing long-term care policy in Japan, the female labor force participation rate is considered because policy approaches take public long-term care as a substitute for family elderly care (Kadoya, 2016).====Consequently, increasing needs for elderly long-term care and progress by women in the market labor force have compelled families and society to share burdens of providing elderly long-term care. This paper presents an analysis of changes in elderly care providers, families, markets, and the state, emphasizing time allocation of families between elderly care at home and the market labor supply along with economic development processes. The model also includes explicit consideration of the market elderly care production industry. This consideration is another important contribution of this paper.====Reports of the literature show that women, mostly adult daughters and daughters-in-law, bear a disproportionate share of the parental care burden (Pezzin and Schone, 1999, Cremer et al., 2012). They also show that rising wage rates have changed the relative shares of time and financial support for elderly parents, i.e., from time to financial transfers (Couch et al., 1999, Zissimopoulos, 2001). These observations suggest that changes in female labor force participation rates and wage rates involve changes in the provision of elderly support: both informal (family) and formal (market and public). The purposes of this paper are to relate the issue of elderly care provision to economic development processes in a dynamic model and to infer patterns of elderly long-term care provision along with economic development.====Fig. 1 presents a time-series of the female employment rate and the gender wage gap in Japan during 1968–2018, showing the rate of population aging as the highest in the economically developed world. The transitions of the series do not show the same direction. They are separable into three periods: that until 1975, that during 1976–2000, and that after 2001. Throughout the entire duration, the ratio of 65-year-old and older people has increased steadily, as has the population aged 85 and older. Declines in the female employment rate during the first period might correspond to increases in family care provision. During the second period, the rate of change in the elderly dependency ratio (i.e., population aged 65 and over relative to the population aged 15–64) increased greatly around 1990.==== Rapid increases in the female employment rate during the third period might be attributable to the introduction of public long-term care insurance in 2000. The ratio of long-term care workers to the population aged 15–64 also increased during the third period.====From comparative static analysis with respect to the level of altruistic children’s income, Pestieau and Sato (2008), among others, report that the form of parental support varies from ==== at lower income levels to ==== at higher income levels.==== Leroux and Pestieau (2014) also describe their analysis of how the respective roles of families, markets, and governments in supporting elderly people have evolved from changes in various factors such as the reliability and effectiveness of family support. These works are fundamentally static, particularly addressing only one generation of agents who live for two periods, young and old, and who differ only with respect to their productivity. As a contrast to these works, this paper presents extension of the analysis in a dynamic setting, i.e., a neoclassical growth model à la Galor and Weil (1996).====The model incorporates consideration of altruism of grown-up children toward their elderly parents, although, for analytical convenience, parental altruism toward children is assumed away.==== The model specifically assesses the behavior of each generation of adult children over their life cycle along with a time path of the economy. Children’s time and financial transfers to their parents are evaluated mainly based on parents’ needs when they become dependent. Otherwise, assistance from the children is provided only as a merit good to the parents, irrespective of the extent to which the parents evaluate them. Public long-term care is expected to be effective only when recipients are unlikely to have any other support (Ioannides and Kan, 1994). Consequently, according to the analytical model examined in this study, parents make no decision for elderly care on their own.==== Following the studies of the relevant literature, only women, mostly daughters and daughters-in-law, are assumed to bear family parental care burdens; also, only female labor is used in the elderly long-term care industry.==== The goods production sector employs capital as well as labor of both women and men. Male labor involves physical and mental (non-physical) factors. Female labor involves only mental factors. Long-term care services outside the home are provided by the private long-term care production sector or by the state, both employing female labor. Mutual benefit societies (or corporations) or insurance companies might also exist, insuring the children’s risk of supporting dependent parents. Such organizations and companies are assumed to be risk neutral; the consumption goods and long-term care markets are assumed to be competitive. It is noteworthy that, throughout the paper, private insurance markets for the children’s risk of caring for dependent parents are distinguished from private care markets for external long-term care services. Children can purchase market long-term care directly for their parents.====Recently, some authors present analyses of the long-term care provision problem using overlapping-generations models. When analyzing the optimal public long-term care policy, Ponthiere (2014) explains that public long-term care policy might eliminate family altruism by affecting family values transmission process and by crowding out intra-family aid. Pestieau and Ponthiere (2016) describe two salient features of past decades: population aging and postponement of births. They report from studying the optimal family policy that although individuals are likely to have too many late births in a laissez-faire situation, early children provide greater amounts of informal long-term care to their elderly parents than late children provide. Canta et al. (2016) describe that, with family norms, public long-term care might foster capital accumulation through savings and private insurance purchase, thereby stimulating economic growth. An important difference of our study from theirs is that we assume market provision of long-term care services. Private producers of long-term care services and public long-term care providers both employ labor from the market. Women choose whether to participate in the labor market because of rising wage rates or to provide family long-term care to their parents because of their altruism toward parents.====The main results are the following. First, when the female wage rate is low in earlier stages of economic development, grown-up daughters and daughters-in-law devote their full time efforts to provision of a merit good, i.e., family elderly care, to the parents. Because of the gender wage gap, family elderly care is assumed to be provided by women. As the female wage rate rises, women start to supply labor to the market, simultaneously reducing family care time at home. When the female wage rate becomes sufficiently high, women work full time to supply their labor to the market. The family then purchases long-term care services from the market.==== Second, if the level of family elderly care becomes lower than the minimum elderly care level for the parents because of high female labor force participation rates, then grown-up children might purchase mutual care insurance and market long-term care insurance. Third, if the amount of elderly care provided by the family becomes too small, then public long-term care programs might be necessary to provide a minimum level of care for elderly people. Fourth, as the female wage rate rises further along with capital accumulation, working children might instead prefer to purchase market long-term-care services and prefer to provide a sufficient level of elderly care to their respective parents.====The organization of the paper is the following. The next section introduces the growth model. Section “Dynamics” presents examination of the model dynamics. Relations among capital accumulation, wage rates, the female labor supply, and family elderly (long-term) care will be examined. In Section “Private insurance and public long-term care”, the possibility of an emergency in private long-term care insurance and state long-term care provision is discussed in relation to economic development.

Three Cox competing risks models are estimated.====The presence of a partner reduces the risk of nursing home admission by 40% for an elderly individual who is 80 years old. However, that protective effect of partners is no longer significant at the 5% level when the elderly suffers from limitations in fundamental activities of daily-living or after the age of 84 when the individual is cognitively impaired.====The low protective effect of partners against the risk of nursing home entry for the oldest-old or severely disabled should lead to a reassessment of the relevance of informal support for this specific group of individuals.","Encouraging in-home support for disabled elderly individuals may contribute to reducing the amount of public expenditures devoted to long-term care, while respecting the will of most of disabled elderly individuals to stay home if possible. Given an elderly individual’s level of disability, community-based production of his level of functioning requires the receipt of long-term care as an input, either through formal home care purchased in the market or informal care provided by family members or relatives (Pezzin et al., 1996). In each family, one determines the combination of formal home care and informal care that produces the optimal level of ====, conditional on the disabled elderly remaining in the community. Then, one compares this option with the alternative of institutional care in a nursing home and chooses the care and associated living arrangement that maximize the overall satisfaction of family members. In this regard, informal care should play a crucial role in the decisions taken regarding a disabled individual’s living arrangement.====Several circumstances may reduce the marginal productivity of informal caregivers and prevent them from providing community-based support for disabled elderly individuals. Helping a disabled relative frequently increases the risk of isolation (Levine et al., 1984), raises the probability of declaring physical or psychological troubles (Coe and Van Houtven, 2009, Llena-Nozal et al., 2011) and reduces labour market participation (Ettner, 1995, Ettner, 1996, Heitmueller, 2007, Johnson and Lo Sasso, 2006): consequently, it can favour nursing home admission. In this regard, from an economic policy perspective, it is crucial to understand the extent to which family members can support their disabled relative and help them to stay living in the community or, conversely, approve their nursing home admission.====In the literature dealing with the explanatory factors for nursing home admission (Banaszak-Holl et al., 2004, Gaugler et al., 2003, Gaugler et al., 2005, Gaugler et al., 2007, Laferrère et al., 2013, Luppa et al., 2010), studies have specifically analysed the effects of informal care use. Several authors highlight a protective effect informal care use against the risk of nursing home entry (Charles and Sevak, 2005, Van Houtven and Norton, 2004). On the contrary, others do not observe any significant effect of the availability of informal caregivers on the future risk of nursing home entry (Ettner, 1994) or find that having children, i.e., potential informal caregivers, makes the protective effect of receiving formal home-care allowances against the risk of institutionalization vanish (Muramatsu et al., 2007).====Several reasons could explain these ambiguous results. First, the influence of informal care on the risk of nursing home entry strongly depends on the nature of the relationship between the disabled elderly individual and the caregiver. The presence of partners and children would have a crucial role against the risk of nursing home entry (Freedman, 1996). In-home support of friends or neighbours may not be as protective. Second, receiving informal care reduces the risk of institutionalization unless the caregivers state that they are overburdened, in which case, the risk increases (Jette et al., 1995).====In this study, we would like to bring new insights into the role of informal care on the risk or nursing home entry. We focus the analysis on the protective role of partners against nursing home entry for their disabled relatives. Looking at the production function of community-based care for disabled elderly individuals, we aim in one sense to study the variations of the marginal productivity of informal care provided by partners over the distribution of care recipient morbidity (physical and mental) through its impact on the disabled individuals’ living arrangements. Taking advantage of a cohort study that included elderly individuals living in the community in two French districts and who were followed for a very long period of 22 years, we can estimate reliable effects of the partner’s presence on the risk of nursing home entry, according to the disability type and the age. To our knowledge, it is the first article dealing with this topic and using such a long-term high-quality cohort study. This article delivers robust quantitative results that help better understanding the influence of a partner presence on care arrangements for disabled or cognitively impaired elderly individuals, in a longitudinal perspective.",Do partners of severely disabled elderly protect against nursing home entry?

We argue the value is particularly great when such comparative research is based on long life-history data on participants, collected using large-scale autobiographical life-history methods. We identify particular aspects of such comparisons that create value relative to other empirical methods and also briefly survey recent key papers to illustrate each aspect. Finally we provide a short new application of this method, using data from SHARE and ====, to look at the question of how labour markets for older workers in Europe have been changing across cohorts and the extent to which this has been associated with changing retirement ages in public pension systems.","International comparisons are becoming a commonly used empirical method in the economics of ageing, partly because of increasing availability of detailed comparable data from multi-disciplinary longitudinal studies of ageing that have been specifically designed for such purposes. But simply documenting how circumstances differ in old age around the world, whether this is in terms of health, social and family circumstances or economic position, is not particularly useful. Good international comparative research needs to be meaningful enough to inform us about what is driving the evolution of outcomes over the life-course in different countries and why. For example, it needs to show the role of policy variables and institutions, the environment (broadly defined), or life course trajectories more generally, in determining how different types of individual in different countries end up with the late-life outcomes that they do.====This paper argues that international comparisons based on retrospectively collected life-history information can be particularly valuable in this respect. We discuss the relatively recent innovation of large-scale standalone retrospective life-history data collection that has now been added to a number of ageing studies around the world, including the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We argue that such life-history data provide a number of advantages. Firstly, researchers using these studies have access to life-course data on more cohorts and hence can exploit more policy variation and policy reforms in their analysis. Second, and related, having complete life-course trajectories ‘observed’ means that researchers can exploit opportunities to link early life exposures to late life outcomes and can carry out trajectory analysis or estimate dynamic panel models with much longer time-series on each individual. Finally, a unique attribute of life-history data is that they cover periods of an individual’s life when they were not in their current household, marriage, or partnership, which can be useful when looking at complex issues surrounding marital selection and sorting.====Finally, and most substantively, as an illustration of the potential value of such data we present some simple new analysis using retrospective life-history on labour market trajectories in twelve European countries for all cohorts born between 1920 and 1959. We take two example questions – namely (a) how important are state retirement ages determining late-life work around Europe? and (b) to what extent is the labour market becoming more flexible for older workers? – to motivate our analysis. As a starting point, we are able to easily replicate the previous findings of one of the first and most important international comparisons in the economics of ageing, namely the Gruber and Wise, 1999, Gruber and Wise, 2004 studies that showed, using different countries and a shorter time period, the importance of state pension institutions in determining employment at older ages. We then go on to show the value of having additional data on the entire trajectory of employment at older ages for different cohorts, as opposed to just cross-sectional data or short panel sequences on work as in the Gruber-Wise studies. We show that, once we condition on whether or not the individual is working at age 50, there are to all intents and purposes no differences in the labour market trajectories of men and women, nor in the way that they are affected by public pension retirement ages. We can also go on to measure the total number of years of work supplied after age 50 as an indicator of late-life work and show, for the first time to our knowledge, how this has been evolving across different cohorts in different countries. In an attempt to suggest some preliminary evidence on cohort trends and international differences in labour market flexibility at older ages, we show that the average number of jobs held after age 50 has been rising steadily across cohorts, although the degree to which this has been happening is very different across Europe.====The paper is structured as follows. In the next section we briefly set out the reasons why international comparisons are considered particularly valuable in ageing research and use this framework to show why international comparisons based on life-history data have so much analytical potential. In section three, we highlight some of the methodological background and innovations underlying the design and collection of such life-history questionnaires, and discuss issues around the validation of such data and methods. Section four provides a brief and partial survey of some of the most promising examples of comparative life-history methods, as a way of illustrating the kind of applications that are possible. As pointed out in this section, the majority of these studies are modelling health or wellbeing outcomes as the endpoint, life-history data have not yet been used extensively for labour market research. Consequently, to illustrate the potential value of such a method, in section five we carry out an analysis of the life-history trajectories for employment in two major ageing surveys covering twelve European countries and discuss the findings that emerge.

We find a strong association between lifetime earnings and life expectancy at age 65 and show that the longevity gap is increasing across cohorts. For West German male employees born 1926–28, the longevity gap between top and bottom decile amounts to about 4 years (about 30%). This gap increases to 7 years (almost 50%) for cohorts 1947–49. We extend our analysis to the household context and show that lifetime earnings are also related to the life expectancy of the spouse. The heterogeneity in life expectancy has sizable and relevant distributional consequences for the pension system: when accounting for heterogeneous life expectancy, we find that the German pension system is regressive despite a strong link between benefits and prior contributions. We show that the ==== of the pension system increases with lifetime earnings. Finally, we document an increase of the regressive structure across cohorts, which is consistent with the increasing longevity gap.","Inequality of lifetime earnings, consumption, and wealth has been increasing over time and between cohorts in most OECD countries, see e.g. Kopczuk et al., 2010, Attanasio and Pistaferri, 2016, or Saez and Zucman (2016). One other dimension of inequality which is highly correlated with the economic inequality is the heterogeneity in life expectancy, see, among others, Gerdtham and Johannesson, 2004, Lindahl, 2005, Cutler et al., 2006, or Pijoan-Mas and Rios-Rull (2014).====In this paper we provide novel evidence on the evolution of cohort-specific heterogeneity in life expectancy by lifetime earnings and analyze the distributional implications of this heterogeneity for the pension system. First, we document the heterogeneity in life expectancy by lifetime earnings of West German male employees and show how the earnings-related longevity gap has evolved over 24 cohorts, born 1926 through 1949. Second, in addition to this direct relation between lifetime earnings and life expectancy we focus on an important indirect relation: we extend the analysis to the household context and analyze how the life expectancy of widows depends on their husband’s lifetime earnings. Third, earnings-related heterogeneity affects the inequality of lifetime income. We quantify the distributional implications of heterogeneous life expectancy via the German pension system.====In general, a pension system can affect the lifetime income distribution for several reasons: The annual benefit formula may not be proportional to prior pension contributions – like the progressive formula of US Social Security. Further, earlier retirement schemes can have progressive implications if actuarial adjustments are not fair and lifetime poor individuals retire on average earlier. Finally, if life expectancy is correlated with prior pension contributions, i.e. if the lifetime poor have a lower life expectancy they receive pensions for a shorter period and this has regressive implications. In the last section of this paper, we focus on this link and quantify the distributional implications of heterogeneous life expectancy via the German pension system and how this has changed between cohorts.====We find a strong association between lifetime earnings and life expectancy at age 65 and show that the longevity gap is increasing across cohorts. For West German male employees born 1926–28, the difference in life expectancy at age 65 between top and bottom decile amounts to about 4 years or close to 30%. For this group, the gap increases to about 7 years (almost 50%) for cohorts 1947–49. Further, we show that the increase in the longevity gap is driven by a larger increase in life expectancies in the upper deciles. For individuals in the bottom decile, life expectancy hardly changed over time. The analysis on the household level documents important indirect effects which reinforce the role of lifetime earnings for life expectancy. We show that life expectancy of widows is increasing with the lifetime earnings of the partner. For widows married to male employees born in 1926–28 we find a longevity gap between top and bottom quintile of male lifetime earnings of about 2.5 years (more than 10%) which increases to 4 years for widows married to male employees boron in 1947–49 (about 20%).====The earnings-related heterogeneity in life expectancy has sizable and relevant distributional consequences for the pension system. We find that the German pension system is progressive when we impose homogeneous life expectancy within a cohort. This is driven by early retirement schemes that have progressive distributional implications because actuarial deductions are less than actuarially fair (see Section 2.1). However, when accounting for heterogeneous life expectancy, the distributional implications turn around: we show that the internal rate of return (IRR) of pension contributions increase in lifetime earnings, making the pension system regressive. Hence, differences in the expected duration of pension benefit recipience overcompensate the progressive implications of the early retirement schemes. Furthermore, we document an increase of the regressive structure across cohorts that reflects the rising longevity gap.====Our study is related to the literature that focuses on heterogeneity in life expectancy. Prior studies document heterogeneity in life expectancy and an increasing longevity gap by earnings over cohorts or time using survey data, such as the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), administrative social security records, or tax records; see e.g. Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973, Waldron, 2007, Cristia, 2009, Kalwij et al., 2012, Sasson, 2016, Chetty et al., 2016. von Gaudecker and Scholz, 2007, Kiebele et al., 2013 focus on Germany. In our analysis we extend this literature; we study the inequality of life expectancy not only on the individual level but we provide as well evidence about the indirect relationship in the household context (with respect to spouses). Moreover, we provide novel evidence for Germany as we document the changes in longevity differences by decile of lifetime earnings over a long time period, namely for cohorts 1926–1949, on the basis of a large administrative data set.====In addition, our study contributes to the literature on the distributional implications of heterogeneous life expectancy for transfer programs and the pension system, e.g. Gustman and Steinmeier, 2001, Coronado et al., 2002, Liebman, 2002, and more recently, Auerbach et al. (2017) for simulation studies for the US, or Breyer and Hupfeld (2009) for Germany.==== Further, several studies theoretically analyze the optimal design of the pension system when life expectancy is heterogeneous (for an overview see Pestieau and Ponthiere (2016)) or use structural models to quantify the distributional and welfare implications of pension reforms, e.g. Fehr et al., 2013, Bagchi, 2016, Sanchez-Romero and Prskawetz, 2017. Our analysis differs from the studies for the US. Instead of using a simulation model to project the implications of hypothetical pension reforms, we use high quality administrative data to document the distributional implications of the cohort-specific pension system (including survivor pensions) in combination with the evolution of cohort-specific heterogeneity in life expectancy.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background and the data. In Section 3, we provide descriptive evidence on mortality rates and discuss the empirical model and the estimation results of cohort-specific heterogeneity in life expectancies and their evolution for male employees and their surviving spouses. In Section 4, we link these findings to the pension system and analyze their distributional implications. Section 5 concludes. In Appendix G, we show that our findings on the distributional implications are even amplified when accounting under additional assumptions for mortality before age 65.",The rising longevity gap by lifetime earnings – Distributional implications for the pension system,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18301452,16 May 2019,2019,Research Article,118.0

This paper argues that ==== change itself is not enough to generate both slower economic growth and a lower real interest rate in an ,"As the population ages there is significant concern that this demographic headwind will permanently lower the real interest rate and lower the potential growth rate of the economy. The standard line of reasoning is that as life expectancy continues to increase, the number of years an individual spends in retirement will increase, resulting in a need for more retirement savings. As people spend relatively more time in retirement, a smaller fraction of the population will be active in the labor market. The increase in retirement savings will drive down the real interest rate and the decline in the fraction of the population participating in the labor market will pull down per capita growth. This effect is only exacerbated by the decline in the fertility rate. In effect, what we have is the ‘Demographic Dividend’ in reverse as suggested by Gordon, 2012, Lee, 2016. If this logic is correct, then the overall health of the U.S. economy and welfare of future generations is suspect as the population ages. Gordon (2015) refers to this potential bleak outlook for the future as supply-side secular stagnation.====We address two sequential questions in this paper. First, is an aging population sufficient to generate supply-side secular stagnation? Our answer to this question is no if we assume growth is endogenous and human capital and physical capital are both variables in the production function. In fact, we demonstrate that population aging actually accelerates the rate of economic growth in our model. Second, if population aging alone doesn’t support the supply-side secular stagnation hypothesis, is there some other mechanism in the economy that does? Our answer to this question is yes. We demonstrate that the existence of institutions that redistribute resources across generations, such as public education and social security, can result in slower economic growth and a lower real interest rate as a population ages. In other words, population aging by itself is not a problem for the economy, but what is potentially problematic is how population aging interacts with existing institutions and how these institutions respond to population aging.====In the context of answering these two questions, we also demonstrate that it is important to differentiate between the underlying causes of population aging, as noted in Lee, 2016, Lee and Mason, 2010. Specifically, we show that the dynamic behavior of the economy depends on whether population aging is the result of a decrease in the fertility rate or an increase in longevity at the end of life. This is especially important when thinking about how population aging interacts with existing intergenerational (government) institutions. Weil (2008) also discusses this in the context of isolating a change in the fertility rate.====To conduct our formal analysis, we construct a model with overlapping generations where agents live for three periods. During the first period of life a child receives an education accumulating human capital through a public education system. During the second period of life an adult works, saves for retirement and pays taxes that fund the public education system and transfers to the elderly. During the final period of life a retiree consumes working period savings and transfer payments. The design of our model pulls from a very large literature, so we only cite a few here. The endogenous growth component builds on the original work of Pecchenino and Utendorf, 1999, Glomm and Ravikumar, 1992, Becker et al., 1990, Lucas, 1988, where there is constant returns to scale in reproducible inputs (human capital and physical capital). The institutional design builds on the work of Gonzales-Eiras and Niepalt, 2012, Boldrin and Montes, 2009, Boldrin and Montes, 2005, Glomm and Kaganovich, 2008, Glomm and Kaganovich, 2003, Pecchenino and Utendorf, 1999, and Poterba (1998) where the working generation provides an education to the young and transfers to the elderly. Finally, the demographic component builds on the work of Ludwig and Vogel, 2010, Lee and Mason, 2010, Bohn, 2001, Bohn, 1997, and Abel (2003), where changes in the fertility rate and life expectancy (longevity) interact with existing institutions.====The mechanics of this model provide us with more detailed answers to the questions above. First, an increase in life expectancy in the last period of life stimulates savings (as expected), which increases physical capital and household earnings through the standard wage effect. This increase in household earnings results in an increase in education spending and more human capital, which increases the growth rate of the economy. Thus, population aging does not result in supply-side secular stagnation. The same logic applies to a decrease in the fertility rate. A lower fertility rate allows society to spend more resources on each child, which results in more human capital and a higher rate of growth. Thus, regardless of the cause, an aging population tends to be growth enhancing on its own. Even the direction of movement for the interest rate isn’t clear. An increase in longevity tends to put downward pressure on the real interest rate, whereas, a decrease in the fertility rate will result in a higher interest rate. In this latter case, the additional human capital drives up the return on physical capital.====So how can population aging generate supply-side secular stagnation? We argue that the decline in the real interest rate and slower economic growth from population aging will likely be the result of government programs that transfer resources across generations, such as public education, Social Security, and Medicare. Specifically, we show that an increase in life expectancy in the last period of life results in an increase in the retiree-to-worker ratio, making the tax rate necessary to fund transfers to the elderly higher. This reduces household net income, which results in less savings and lower funding for public education. Thus, a PAYGO social insurance program is a necessary condition for slower economic growth. The strength of this “demographic headwind” is shown to be a function of how much the additional transfers to the elderly crowd out investment in children. If a society chooses to fund additional transfers to the elderly by increasing the tax rate required to fund social security and Medicare (or any other program transferring resources to the elderly) while maintaining the same level of investment in children, then the population aging effect is likely to be relatively small in our model. However, if society chooses to offset some or all of the tax increase required to fund additional transfers to the elderly through cuts in education funding, then the effect can become very large. In other words, the strength of this demographic headwind will depend on how society chooses to pay for the additional transfers to the elderly. As Gordon (2015) suggests, the pressure on future growth will likely come from increasing education costs and socioeconomic factors. Our model captures this dynamic story.====We also show that a decrease in the fertility rate results in an increase in the growth rate of the economy ==== education funding is maintained, even with intergenerational redistribution programs. That is, a lower fertility rate allows for more expenditure per child (more human capital) and higher incomes during the working years, which offsets the higher tax rate required to fund the retirement benefits of relatively larger group of individuals. In this case the demographic headwind from population aging critically depends on how society chooses to pay for the additional transfers to the elderly. If society chooses to cut education funding in response to the need for more retirement funding, this will offset the benefit of the decline in the fertility rate.====As a final exercise, we apply our model to U.S. data to get a general sense of the effect population aging will have on the economy. Clearly, given the stylized nature of our framework, the appropriate interpretation of the results that follow are qualitative in nature. However, the magnitude of the effects are clear. Given the data, we find that the drag an aging society places on long-run growth of the U.S. economy over the next 30 years varies from 0.03 to 0.125 percentage points when the government does not cut education funding under three different cost scenarios. That is, as long as the U.S. continues to invest in education and the health of future generations an aging population is not likely to have a major impact on growth. However, if the government chooses to maintain the overall tax burden on society by reducing spending on children, the long-run growth rate of the economy can actually turn negative. Thus, the key to the future is how the U.S. chooses to fund payments to the elderly (assuming cuts are not politically feasible). We also show that the overall impact on economic growth is nonlinear and depends on the degree of educational investment crowd-out. We see a similar effect on the U.S. real interest rate, using the return on capital as a proxy. When there is no educational crowd-out, the interest rate drops by only 10 to 30 basis points. In the high-cost scenario the real rate turns negative when there is complete educational crowd-out.====Before turning to the details of our model, it is worthwhile spending some time on a key assumption in our modeling strategy. Specifically, we assume the existence of a social contract between generations that specifies the initial amount of expenditures on each side of the age distribution. We then analyze how potential variations in this social contract, caused by population aging, affect long run growth and the real interest rate. That is, our model is silent on the social contract ‘existence’ debate. For those interested in why these types of social contracts might arise between generations, see Becker and Murphy, 1988, Kotlikoff et al., 1988, and Hansson and Stuart (1989), or for more recent work see Rangel, 2003, Boldrin and Montes, 2009, Boldrin and Montes, 2005. This approach also implies that we abstract from human capital choice. ====Instead we focus on the public expenditure side of the ledger, where tax revenue determines the amount of investment in each child. Given that less than 10% of students enrolled in K-12 attend private schools in the United States, this assumption is most likely not too far off the mark for non-tertiary education (see, NCES Fast Facts Report).==== However, it is also worth noting that our results are consistent with the findings in the optimal choice literature. For example, Pecchenino and Utendorf (1999) demonstrate that an increase in the tax rate funding transfers to the elderly will likely crowd-out private investment in education by households. We show a similar effect applies to public education and that the degree to which this crowd-out occurs can have serious implications for the long-run health of the economy. Their results, combined with ours, suggest that if a society chooses to fund additional transfers to the elderly by increasing tax revenue it is likely that both private ==== public investment in education will move in the same direction. Thus, the argument of “private offset” or additional individual investment is unlikely.====There are other branches of theoretical research that look at economic growth and/or interest rate movements in the context of demographic change that deserve mentioning before moving on. First, there are the papers by Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018, Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017 which argue that automation might offset some of the effects population aging will have on the economy by creating new tasks or jobs associated with the automation process resulting in faster growth. However, we conjecture their results are not mutually exclusive from ours. The new tasks automation will likely generate are going to require an educated labor force. If there is a reduction in spending on human capital, then this will reduce the ability of society to implement the new tasks created by automation. In a related branch of research, Prettner, 2014, Strulik et al., 2013 demonstrate that an increase in human capital intensity (human capital per worker) can offset the negative effect of a declining fertility rate on economic growth in an R&D setting. That is, more human capital will accelerate growth through an increase in the effective labor force. This is consistent with our result, assuming human capital investment is unaffected by government transfers to the elderly. Prettner (2013) demonstrates that an increase life expectancy will also accelerate growth in an R&D setting. Again this is consistent with our result, assuming the transfer program to the elderly is inactive. There is also the paper by Hashimoto and Tabata (2016) which shows that an increase in life expectancy will increase economic growth under certain conditions and decrease growth under other conditions. Their results highlight the complexity of demographic change and economic activity in the presence of child rearing subsidies and education subsidies. There are also the demand-side secular stagnation papers by Eggertsson et al., 2019, Eggertsson and Mehrotra, 2014, Summers, 2016, Summers, 2014, and Hansen (1939). Here the argument is that there is a gap between (or change in) the savings and investment schedules in the economy. The increase in savings and/or decrease in investment demand puts downward pressure on the real interest rate. The decrease in consumption (increased savings) potentially pulls down growth. This may be the result of deleveraging, population dynamics, a reduced price of investment goods, or inequality to cite a few motivating factors. It is highly likely that the demand-side and supply-side factors are both contributing to a lower real interest rate and will potentially place a drag on long-term growth.====The rest of the paper is as follows. Section “The Basic Framework” presents the basic model. In Section “Equilibrium Dynamics” we derive the equilibrium dynamics and define the balanced growth rate of the economy and the real interest rate. Section “Isolating the Effects of Aging and Policy” demonstrates that demographic change alone is not sufficient to generate slower growth and that generational spending programs are necessary for this result to occur in the model. Section “Modeling the Relationship between Demographic Change and Generational Spending” describes the relationship between the spending programs following a permanent increase in life expectancy and/or a decrease in the fertility rate. This section also formally defines our measure of educational crowd-out. Section “General Equilibrium: Demographic Change and the Policy Parameter Restrictions” demonstrates how a change in longevity or the fertility rate affect the economy for various degrees of crowd-out. Section “General Equilibrium: Demographic Projection for the United States” applies the model to U.S. data to better understand the potential effects population aging will on the U.S. economy.

In a region which has traditionally subscribed to the importance of providing family support for the older generation, the twin social forces of reduced fertility and urbanisation are placing this source of support under strain. Financing LTC will become an increasing challenge (Assous, 2001, Castries, 2009). The Chinese Government now recognises this reality, and has adopted a range of pilot programs to gain insight into what might be a future policy position on LTC.====LTC, whether provided formally or informally, is expensive. Private LTC insurance has not proved widely successful (McShane and Cox, 2009, Brown and Finkelstein, 2007, Brown and Finkelstein, 2011, McNamara and Lee, 2004, Finkelstein and McGarry, 2006). Most developed countries have an LTC policy which subsidizes LTC recipients and their families, and China is following in this tradition, examining alternative social insurance schemes.====Studies of China-based LTC mainly focus on frailty prevalence and mortality hazard ratios (Gu et al., 2009, Jin, 2006, Leung et al., 1997, Millan-Calenti et al., 2010). Almost no cost estimates exist. The aim of this paper is to analyze a comprehensive care insurance==== program in Qingdao, China, modelling its cost structure at the individual level and discussing implications for other regions in China or other countries. We estimate a multi-state transition model of an elder entering LTC with either institutional or home service, the average duration of care for eligible members at specific ages, and the total cost of comprehensive care for the average disabled elder in the program. Similar exercises are available in some developed countries (Dilnot Commission, 2011, Kemper et al., 2005, Favreault and Dey, 2015), but this represents the first attempt to estimate part of the cost of comprehensive care based on actual utilization data for disabled elders in China.====The Qingdao program provides comprehensive care for institutional recipients, but only medical-related comprehensive care for home recipients. Social care, which includes house cleaning, meal preparation, personal hygiene support, etc., is not included in the program (it is covered by another welfare program with means-test provisions). As home recipients’ social care is not included, the estimated cost is less than a complete service package. However, the transition probability, duration, and current cost structure can provide insights to inform the design of a more comprehensive system. The exercise represents the first-stage cost mechanism for the most severely disabled elders. The next section introduces the Comprehensive Care Insurance for Disabled Elders (CCIDE) pilot project in Qingdao, China. “Data and methods” discusses the data and model, followed by results and simulation analysis in “Results”. “Conclusion and discussion” concludes.",Preparing for population ageing: Estimating the cost of formal aged care in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300653,14 December 2018,2018,Research Article,121.0

We set the model economy with or without a pay-as-you-go pension and were able to derive the following results. First, in the model without a pension, the subsidy for elderly care services raises the full time workers because of substitution between formal and informal elderly care. Second, in the model with a pension, the subsidy for elderly care services can not always pull up the full time workers because of the effects on the pension. With certain conditions, the subsidy can raise full time workers and the pension benefit can be raised. This result demonstrates that a subsidy for elderly care services should be regarded as raising or maintaining the pension benefit.","Japanese society is aging progressively. Older people who need elderly care services are expected to become increasingly numerous. In the aging societies of OECD countries, long-term care expenditures and the workforce allocated to providing elderly care services are also expected to increase. These circumstances prevailing in OECD countries are explained comprehensively by Hashimoto and Tabata (2010). Colombo et al. (2011) presents a recent OECD study of long-term care. Average public spending on long-term care was ==== of GDP in 2008. Public spending increases in an aging society. The ratio of the elderly care services workforce to the total workforce was ==== in 2008. Cremer et al. (2012) explain that elderly care services will necessarily increase in OECD countries. France and Germany provide sufficient elderly care services in the market. Largely for that reason, informal care provided by families there is not expected to increase greatly.==== However, such informal care provided by families is expected to increase to a considerable degree in Italy and Poland. Family-provided informal care adversely affects the labor supply because potential workers instead choose to care for family members. Younger people care for their elderly parents using their own time. Therefore, younger people must cut their working time, engendering a decrease in the aggregate labor supply. Moreover, the fertility rate is low in OECD countries, especially in Japan. People of working age might actually decrease in the future. This fact presents a difficulty because a decrease in the labor supply reduces tax revenues. Consequently, the government is expected to become increasingly unable to provide sufficient social security benefits.====Elderly care of two types exists: market elderly care services (formal elderly care) and family elderly care services (informal elderly care). The latter entails several difficulties. If younger people provide family elderly care to their parents, then the younger people themselves must decrease their labor supplied to the market or stop working entirely. They might be adversely affected by that declining or non-existent labor income. Moreover, the decrease in aggregate labor supply reduces tax revenues because of the decreased labor income. Therefore, informal elderly care should be avoided. Nevertheless, difficulties also arise with market-supplied elderly care services. If the price of market elderly care services is high enough, then individuals become unable to use market-supplied elderly care services because of their insufficient income. Therefore, the government should provide a subsidy for market elderly care services. Individuals can thereby use market elderly care services at low cost. Nevertheless, large outlays are necessary for the subsidy, representing a loss for social welfare. Therefore, both formal elderly care and informal elderly care entail their respective benefits and shortcomings.====This paper presents an examination of how subsidies for elderly care services affect demand for elderly care services and the labor market for elderly care services. In an aging society, labor supply shortages present great difficulties. If informal elderly care decreases because of the provision of formal care, then a household can supply more labor time, which increases the aggregate labor supply.====In addition to labor supply shortage difficulties, wage rates in the elderly care sector are low. A shortage of labor in the elderly care sector persists in Japan.==== Moreover, social security expenditures continue to increase because of the aging society. Providing a certain level of pension benefits is difficult in an aging society because of a lack of revenue that occurs along with the decrease in the number of younger people. However, even if younger people become fewer, the government can gain revenues by virtue of an increased labor supply.====This paper presents a model that incorporates elderly care services with a pay-as-you-go pension. The model yields the following results. Without pay-as-you-go pension, the subsidy for elderly care services can raise the full time workers because the informal elderly care time can be reduced in favor of formal elderly care services. In addition to this effect, the price of elderly care services increases. Then the labor supply in the market of elderly care services increases.====However, in the model with a pay-as-you-go pension, the aggregate labor supply can not always be pulled up by a subsidy. The demand for elderly care services increases because of an increase in pension benefits. Then the price of elderly care services increases if the pension benefits can be increased by the subsidy because of an increase in the wage rate in the elderly care sector. Eventually, the demand for elderly care services can be reduced because of an increase in the price of elderly care services. Therefore, the subsidy can raise not only the full time workers but also the pension benefit if the effect of a decrease on the aggregate labor supply is small. This result demonstrates how the government should consider increasing or maintaining the level of the pension benefit in an aging society.====The government establishes child-care support policies to raise fertility, supporting the working population of the future. Child-care policies are intended to develop and support the working population to provide sufficient social security benefits for future generations. However, the analyses presented herein demonstrate that an increase in pension benefits will occur even if the government does not execute child-care support policies.====This paper comprises the following sections. Section 2 explains related reports from the literature. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4 presents derivation of the equilibrium in the model economy.

Previous research, largely based on limited exposure periods, reached mixed conclusions. We use Health and Retirement Study data linked to the Department of Labor’s O*Net job classification system to examine the relationship between lifetime exposure to occupational demands and disability later in life. We consistently find an association between non-routine cognitive demands and lower rates of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) receipt and work-limiting health conditions. Routine manual demands are associated with moderately worse health and increased SSDI receipt in most lifetime specifications. These results are robust to various specifications of occupational demand measures and controlling for transitions between jobs of different levels of occupational intensity. We show that failure to account for ==== exposure early in a worker’s tenure obscures the relationship between physical job demands and disability later in life. While characteristics of jobs worked at ages 30 and 55 are both predictive of later-life health outcomes, early-life job characteristics frequently dominate in models containing early and late exposures.","Work accounts for a significant portion of Americans’ daily lives and is increasingly recognized as a determinant of health status. Research dating to the Whitehall study results of the 1970s has shown a relationship between occupation and long-term health outcomes including mortality, diabetes and cardiovascular disease that cannot be explained by differences in income, education, health behaviors or access to health insurance (Marmot et al., 1978). Several studies have found that older workers retire from physically demanding jobs more rapidly than from other types of jobs (i.e. Case and Deaton, 2005, Filer and Petri, 1988, Hayward et al., 1989, Mitchell et al., 1988) but have focused on characteristics of current jobs, which are likely jointly determined with health and labor force status. A growing literature in economics and medicine has found lasting health effects of adverse early life health exposures, including the earliest events experienced in utero (Almond and Currie, 2011, Almond, 2006, Smith, 2009), suggesting that exposure to job demands throughout the life course may influence work capacity and health later in life.====In this paper, we examine the relationship between lifetime occupational exposures which may harm or hurt health, including physical and cognitive job demands, on subjective and objective measures of whether health limits work capacity later in life including application for and receipt of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits and self-reported work limitations at age 62. We use lifetime jobs reported by older adult respondents in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), covering an average of 37.5 years of employment, which enables us to assess the intensity and duration of a worker’s exposure to physical and cognitive job demands during both early and late career jobs. Our study extends prior research by using a much longer work history, accounting for exposure by age 30 and at various points over the lifecourse, in contrast to starting at age 50 and or relying on short exposure periods as most studies of job characteristics and later life health have done; including women, who have traditionally been excluded from many studies in this literature; using a more comprehensive and accurate classification system for job characteristics; and focusing on both subjective and objective measures of later-life disability including SSDI benefit receipt and self-assessed work limitations.====We find that greater exposure to physically demanding jobs over a worker’s career is associated with a higher probability of receiving SSDI benefits and of having a work-limiting health condition at age 62. In contrast, exposure to high levels of non-routine cognitive interpersonal job demands, and to a lesser extent routine cognitive demands, is associated with lower probabilities of SSDI application and receipt and health limitations. Our results are relatively large in magnitude and are robust to different specifications and sample selections. Our data allow us to study the potential for health-related selection out of demanding jobs to bias estimates of the relationship between job demands and health early in workers’ careers, advantageous given that half of workers who transition out of jobs with high levels of routine manual or routine cognitive demands do so prior to age 45. Routine physical and cognitive demands of the job worked at age 30 are predictive of later-life health limitations and SSDI claiming, while non-routine cognitive interpersonal demands measured later in life are more informative for these outcomes than early life measures.====Our job histories also allow us to describe transitions over the course of a career. We show that many major changes in exposure to job demands occur prior to age 50, leaving little within-person variation to inform panel data models examining the health effects of contemporaneous job characteristics on older workers. For example, only 10% of workers experience a job transition with a large (one standard deviation or greater) change in their level of non-routine cognitive demands, 3% routine cognitive, and 6% routine manual demands between ages 50 and 65. While characteristics of jobs worked at ages 30 and 55 are both predictive of later-life health outcomes, early-life job characteristics frequently dominate in models containing early and late exposures.",Lifetime job demands and later life disability,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300276,10 December 2018,2018,Research Article,123.0

Results indicate a beneficial effect of post-retirement employment on self-assessed health and depressive symptoms for both women and men.","When retirement systems were instituted in the late 19th century and early 20th century, the age of eligibility for receipt of a pension was above average life expectancy and thus it is not surprising that, on average, retirement was associated with death or declining health. The belief that retirement is bad for your health has persisted for some time (Coe and Lindeboom, 2008); however, less is known about the impact of returning to work in retirement on health-related outcomes (Zhan et al., 2009).====Over the past few decades, scholars have made notable advancements regarding retirement decision making (Charles, 2002, Freudenberg et al., 2017), noting the importance of studying mature age labour force participation (Temple et al., 2017, Garcia et al., 2017, Dedry et al., 2015) as well as post-retirement employment, also known as bridge employment, unretirement, or paid work at the point when a person starts to receive a pension (i.e. Kanabar, 2015, Beehr and Bennett, 2015, Shultz, 2003, Kim and Feldman, 2000, Ruhm, 1990). Previous work examining the effects of post-retirement employment on health has not tested for potential endogeneity issues (see for example Zhan et al., 2009), the existence of which could have important implications for our understanding of the impact of returning to work in retirement on health-related outcomes. As Coe and Lindeboom (2008) have explained, identification of the causal relationship between health and labour force outcomes requires independent variation in health or work status as well as a practical way to directly address this variation.====Reviews of the literature on health and retirement have demonstrated that poor health is likely to induce earlier retirement (van Rijn et al., 2014) and that couples synchronize or coordinate their retirement timing (Queiroz and Souza, 2017), but evidence regarding the impact of retirement on health has yielded contradictory findings (i.e. van der Heide et al., 2013, Avendano and Berkman, 2015). These reviews of the retirement literature also illustrate that much of what is known about the relationship between health and retirement is based on cross-sectional analyses and samples that exclude women (van Rijn et al., 2014, van der Heide et al., 2013).====Analyses of the “retirement-health nexus” have advanced with panel data studies by making use of a range of instruments to estimate the impact of retirement on health. For example, an individuals’ retirement expectations have been used as instruments related to retirement behavior but uncorrelated to health (Insler, 2014) and the U.S. Social Security system has also been used as an instrument to examine the impact of retirement on subjective measures of health among men (Charles, 2002, Neuman, 2008). Retirement has also been instrumented by using the cross-country variation in retirement age across Europe (Bonsang et al., 2012, Heller-Sahlgren, 2017) and spouse’s characteristics (Heller-Sahlgren, 2012).====Early studies of retirement were predominantly based on men’s experiences, largely because labour force participation is more selective among women. Initial studies that included women were typically meant to provide a spousal perspective on their husband’s adjustment to retirement (Szinovacz, 2003, Moen and Roehling, 2005). Notable exceptions include Zhu’s (2016) study of Australian women, the Whitehall study of British civil servants (i.e. Mein et al., 2003), and Mojon-Azzi et al. (2007) study of Swiss men and women. The current cohort of retirees offers the potential to provide important insights into the relationship between health and retirement for women, as this is the first time that large and heterogeneous groups of women in the U.S. are experiencing retirement. Prior research highlights important gender differences in early career labour market opportunities, wages, and opportunities for advancement (Borella et al., 2017). These differences in labour force experiences, and the fact that women’s labour force participation has grown in the last few decades, motivate the focus on gender differences in our analyses.====The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact of post-retirement employment on subjective measures of health for men and women. Using data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, we use an identification strategy that is based on an instrumental variables (IV) approach in a conditional mixed process model combined with a correlated random effects (CRE) specification. This model allows us to control for unobserved, time-invariant individual heterogeneity and to address the potential endogeneity of retirement in nonlinear models.====This paper aims to contribute to the literature on health and retirement in a number of ways. First, we investigate the effect of post-retirement work on health. Studies to date have typically focused on the effect of retirement on health and have ignored the effect of going back to work on health. Second, we use an econometrics framework that allows us to control for the potential endogeneity of retirement, as well as the endogeneity of unobserved, time-invariant heterogeneity. Studies focusing on post-retirement employment on health have typically not dealt with these issues, which could have important implications for the results obtained from standard pooled or random effects specifications. Finally, we consider the potential for differential effects on women compared to men.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: “Data” provides an overview of the data set and defines the variables used in the analyses. “Econometric approach” outlines the econometric approach. “Results” reports descriptive information about the study sample and the regression results. “Discussion” provides a discussion of the results and identifies areas for future research.",The effect of post-retirement employment on health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X1730097X,27 November 2018,2018,Research Article,124.0

Using the Singapore Life Panel®, we explore older Singaporeans’ levels of financial knowledge and compare them to those observed in the United States. We assess portfolio complexity for these older households, to examine how financial literacy is related to outcomes of interest. We show that older Singaporeans’ levels of financial literacy are comparable overall to those in the United States, even though older Singaporeans score slightly lower on some dimensions (knowledge of interest and inflation), and slightly higher on their knowledge of risk diversification. We document that women are less informed than men about stock diversification, and educated people tend to be more financially knowledgeable than their less educated counterparts. We also find that financial literacy is positively associated with respondents having both more ==== and more diversified and complex portfolios.","Around the world, higher levels of financial literacy have been shown to be associated with more financial planning and saving, better investment behavior, and a better understanding of how to manage retirement drawdowns (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). This is particularly important in view of peoples’ increased responsibility to effectively plan for and manage their own retirement savings and decumulation in the context of defined contribution plans. Nevertheless, several studies have also found that financial knowledge is low among older adults, even in nations with highly developed financial systems such as the UK and the US, as well as countries with less sophisticated financial markets such as Russia (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011a, Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011b).====Until recently, Singapore was a country where financial literacy had been little analyzed, notwithstanding the reality that it is one of the world’s most rapidly aging nations (Chan, 2001). Moreover, Singaporeans must make a number of key financial decisions in connection with their contributions to, investments in, and decumulation from their nation’s mandatory pension scheme known as the Central Provident Fund (CPF). On the one hand, one might anticipate that older Singaporeans would be quite financially literate, having benefited from the country’s globally-renowned educational system, top-ranked since the 1960s (OECD, 2012). On the other hand, the government has, since 1955, required participation in the CPF. Participants who expected that their CPF accounts would provide financial security in retirement may have devoted less effort to self-management and investing in financial knowledge. Moreover, the diversity of backgrounds, languages, and relatively lower levels of education among the older Singaporean population versus today’s prime-age population could imply lower levels of financial knowledge for this group (OECD, 2016).====This paper reports the first analysis of older Singaporeans’ financial literacy using a unique new dataset, the Singapore Life Panel (SLP®). Using this nationally representative survey, we address three important questions. First, we assess older Singaporeans’ levels of financial knowledge and compare their results to findings from the US. Second, we examine the empirical linkages between financial literacy and retirement preparedness in Singapore. Third, we evaluate the extent to which financial knowledge in Singapore is associated with financial portfolio complexity and asset diversification among the older population.====To preview our findings, we show that overall financial literacy among older adults in Singapore is comparable, but nevertheless slightly lower than in the United States. Somewhat unexpectedly, financial literacy in Singapore is higher for the 55–70 age group versus the age 50–54 reference category. Better-educated people are more financially knowledgeable, while women are less financially informed. These results are similar to those from other countries. We also show that close to half of older Singaporeans anticipate that they will struggle in retirement (46%), and fewer than half say they are well prepared financially for retirement (43%). Overall, the most financially literate are least worried about retirement finances. Finally, we evaluate the correlates of complex portfolio holdings and asset diversification among older Singaporeans. We show that financial knowledge is associated with higher household net worth, higher net financial wealth, and more net non-housing wealth, and the financially savvy hold more diversified and riskier portfolios. This is true even after controlling for education, indicating that financial literacy plays a role in peoples’ portfolio decisions, independent of schooling. These findings represent empirical associations between financial literacy and peoples’ financial decisionmaking since our research design does not support a causal interpretation. As such, this paper is a first step in a larger research plan on retirement saving in Singapore.====In what follows, we first provide a brief background on the Singaporean retirement system. Next we describe the dataset and then outline the empirical methodology we use to answer our three questions.

However, the results obtained through the matching procedure are superior in terms of subgroups comparability and model performance. These results show that voluntary retirees have a higher level of subjective well-being than involuntary retirees not only in the short but also in the long-term, the latter contradicting our expectation that the two groups would converge over time.","Despite having been the topics of numerous papers since at least the 1950s, research on the impact of retirement on subjective well-being is still flourishing. There now seems to be a fair amount of agreement that retirement has at the aggregate level either a neutral or slightly positive effect on subjective well-being (Henning et al., 2016, Luhmann et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2011). However, more recent research identified new questions that still lack unequivocal answers. As a recent review highlighted (Henning et al., 2016), several recent papers found a dynamic effect of retirement on subjective well-being as well as important heterogeneity between individuals. Indeed, it seems that subjective well-being may fluctuate following retirement, and that individuals with different characteristics or experiences may differ considerably concerning how they perceive their well-being following retirement.====This paper concentrates on the differential effect of voluntary and involuntary retirement on subjective well-being 0–3 years and 8–11 years following retirement. In this paper, subjective well-being is conceptualized as someone’s assessment of his or her life (Diener et al., 2016). Voluntary retirees are those who prefer retirement over the continuation of their job whereas involuntary retirees are those who retire due to labor market constraints (Dorn and Sousa-Poza, 2010). With the important aging of populations in Europe and other parts of the world, actions are taken to narrow disparities in subjective well-being among older people (Zaidi et al., 2013). If involuntary retirement proves to have long-lasting consequences on subjective well-being, then actions can aim at reducing the incidence of such retirements. These actions can target the context in which the retirement transition takes place as it is thought to influence whether retirement is voluntary or not (Dorn and Sousa-Poza, 2010).====A few papers already studied the impact of involuntary retirement on subjective well-being at more than one point after the retirement transition. Gall et al., 1997, Reitzes and Mutran, 2004 considered subjective well-being at two points after the retirement transition, both finding a significant effect in the short-term and an insignificant one in the long-term. Using a rich longitudinal dataset, Bonsang and Klein (2012) measured yearly change in subjective well-being up to ten years before and ten years after the retirement transition. These authors observe an important drop in subjective well-being among involuntary retirees in the first few years following retirement, but also an almost complete recovery in the subsequent years. Other research aimed at explaining the difference in subjective well-being between voluntary and involuntary retirees. Using similar data and methods as Bonsang and Klein, 2012, Abolhassani and Alessie, 2013 find that the significant difference in subjective well-being between voluntary and involuntary retirees disappears when controlling for those who involuntary retired following unemployment. Dingemans and Henkens (2014) find that bridge employment (employment following a period of retirement) mitigate the negative effect of involuntary retirement on subjective well-being, while Hershey and Henkens (2013) found that a faster rate of decline in health among involuntary retirees explains in part their lower subjective well-being.====The present paper further examines the question of whether involuntary and voluntary retirees converge over time in terms of subjective well-being. The way it does so differs from the previous literature in at least two aspects. First, genetic matching is used on longitudinal data to test the hypotheses at hand. Previous research fitted regression models to longitudinal data controlling for baseline characteristics to avoid any endogeneity bias between subjective well-being and retirement (Bonsang and Klein, 2012, Abolhassani and Alessie, 2013, Fonseca et al., 2014). We identified two shortcomings of such approaches. First, they are subject to extrapolation bias since voluntary and involuntary retirees can differ considerably concerning their observed characteristics. Second, parametric regression models are exposed to interpolation bias, which arise from using the wrong functional form of the control variables (Ho et al., 2006, King and Zeng, 2006). We use matching to avoid these types of biases. Matching allows to increase homogeneity in a set of covariates between members of two groups that differ concerning a characteristic of interest, e.g. between voluntary and involuntary retirees. This in turn allows to approximate as much as possible the conditions of an experiment. Matching on longitudinal data was previously used to study the effect of parenthood on subjective well-being (Baetschmann et al., 2016, Balbo and Arpino, 2016, Sironi and Billari, 2013), but we are unaware of its use to study the effect of retirement on subjective well-being.====This paper further contributes to the literature by examining the case of Hungarian retirees. Traditionally, western European and north American countries have been the countries of interest when studying the effect of retirement on subjective well-being. The transition from a centrally planned state economy to a market economy had serious repercussions on the labor market in Hungary, and the spike in unemployment that followed was to a large extent absorbed by the early retirement system (Szalai, 1991). However, in the last 20 years, various policy measures aiming to extend working careers have entered into force. The official retirement age was raised from age 60 for men and age 55 for women to age 62 for both, effective in 2000 and 2008 respectively (OECD, 2015). Still, the employment rates of Hungarian men aged 60–64 were the lowest of all OECD countries during the 2001–2010 period (Ebbinghaus & Hofäcker, 2013). Although Hungary is in general terms poorer than western European countries, in comparison to the whole society the relative income position of Hungarian elderlies is one of the best in the European Union. The median earner in Hungary makes a pension which amounts to 94% of their previous earning (Szalai, 1991, Zaidi, 2011), which is to a large extent thanks to a generous state pension (OECD, 2015). This in turn means that Hungarian elderly rely comparatively little on own savings or on occupational pensions, and that very few of them work past the retirement age. At the same time, interestingly, the proportion of involuntary retirement is high in this country in comparison to other European countries (Dorn and Sousa-Poza, 2010, Kohli, 2014).====We draw two lessons from our results. First, matching provides an excellent framework for studying the effect of retirement on subjective well-being. This method increases considerably the comparability of the two sub-samples, thus reducing the risk of extrapolation and interpolation bias. Second, contrary to our expectation, the conditions in which retirement takes place does have long lasting effects on subjective well-being. This warrants efforts for either reducing the incidence of involuntary retirement or promote the mechanisms that dampens the negative effects of involuntary retirement on subjective well-being.====The paper is organized as follow. The second section presents the theoretical framework. The third section presents the data, including some descriptive results. The fourth section presents the matching method. The fifth section presents results from the regression model as performed on the whole sample and compares them to results of the regression model performed on the matched sample.

We incorporate measures of disease prevalence into a human capital augmented production function, which enables us to determine the economic burden of chronic health conditions in terms of foregone gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike earlier frameworks, this approach allows us to account for i) variations in human capital for workers in different age groups, ii) mortality and morbidity effects of non-communicable diseases, and iii) the treatment costs of diseases. We apply our methodology to China, Japan, and South Korea, and estimate the economic burden of chronic conditions in five domains (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health conditions). Overall, total losses associated with these diseases over the period 2010–2030 are (measured in real USD with the base year 2010) estimated to be $7.7 trillion for China, $3.5 trillion for Japan, and $1 trillion for South Korea.","Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 65% of all deaths (Lozano et al., 2011) and 54% of all healthy life years lost as measured by DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) (Murray et al., 2013). Apart from the enormous pain and suffering that these conditions impose, the global economic burden of non-communicable diseases has been estimated to be in the region of $47 trillion from 2010 through 2030 (measured in ppp-adjusted international dollars with the base year being 2010, or 75% of global GDP in 2010; see Bloom et al., 2012). Moreover, the prevalence of chronic conditions, specifically NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health conditions, will rise substantially over the coming decades (Kearney et al., 2005).====This phenomenon is likely to affect not only developed countries but also low- and middle-income countries as a result of changes in modifiable risk factors (such as smoking, dietary, and exercise patterns) and non-modifiable risk factors (such as population ageing). One important factor driving chronic disease prevalence worldwide is the shift of lifestyle patterns toward more sedentary occupations and less healthy diets. Urbanization has many economic benefits in terms of returns to agglomeration, specialization, and efficiency, but it can also affect population health negatively through mechanisms such as diffusion of risky behaviour and exposure to pollution. One important difference in risk factor trajectories between low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries is the divergence in smoking patterns. While cigarette and tobacco consumption has been falling in many high-income countries, it has been rising in India and China. Given that tobacco consumption is the most important risk factor for many non-communicable diseases, this increase is likely to raise their prevalence in those countries. Another difference between developed and developing countries is that the former have been quite successful at minimizing the risk of death associated with communicable diseases, whereas communicable diseases remain a major contributor to mortality in low-income countries. This implies that low-income countries often face the double burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases.====In developed countries, population ageing is an inexorable consequence of changing fertility and mortality patterns. Many high-income countries already face rapid demographic change, and because chronic conditions tend to increase with age, the proportion of their populations affected by non-communicable diseases will rise. Likewise, many emerging economies are either already experiencing population ageing or will do so in the near future. Particularly interesting cases for studying the effects of ageing-related increases in non-communicable disease prevalence are Japan, because it has the largest share of older people globally, and China and South Korea, because they are experiencing very rapid population ageing. The main goals of this paper are to estimate and project the economic burden of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health conditions for these three countries until 2030 and to compare the corresponding challenges that these countries face.====Through several pathways, the disease burden affects economic outcomes in general and economic growth in particular.==== First, chronic conditions reduce the supply of labour through mortality, early retirement (Dwyer and Mitchell, 1999, Lindeboom and Kerkhofs, 2009, Jones et al., 2010), and reduced productivity (López-Casasnovas et al., 2005, Jäckle and Himmler, 2010). In addition, individuals may alter their employment behaviour because they anticipate, or fear, the future onset of illness and negative effects of health conditions (McGarry, 2004).==== Second, current interventions related to NCDs (including medical treatment and prevention) require a substantial amount of resources, part of which could instead be used for other productive activities. Therefore, NCDs reduce the net availability of government funds and impede the accumulation of physical capital by, for example, diverting investment from important areas such as education and infrastructure. Additionally, reduced productivity and lower labour supply, in tandem with higher private health care costs, will lead to a decline in aggregate income and, therefore, further reduce savings and investment. Third, if the impact of NCDs varies by age, then age group differences in (average) education and experience will impact the aggregate human capital stock. Our model integrates these pathways, as summarized in Fig. 1, into a macroeconomic production framework. Focusing on the impact of NCDs on the supply of labour, human and physical capital, and the resultant implications for GDP growth allows us to arrive at a comprehensive measure of the economic burden of the NCDs that we consider – as indicated by foregone GDP.====The economic impact of health conditions in general, and non-communicable diseases in particular, is of special importance and interest to policymakers. Faced with increases in the prevalence of chronic conditions, governments and other stakeholders may wish to enact policies that are effective at reducing disease incidence and its consequences. Several possible interventions can reduce the prevalence of non-communicable diseases. For example, a series of “best-buy” investments has been proposed because they are cost-effective and easy to implement within the constraints of low- and middle-income countries. These policies include increasing taxes on alcohol and tobacco sales, reducing salt intake in food, and replacing trans fats with polyunsaturated fats (Bloom et al., 2011). However, establishing whether particular programs are worthy of investment can be difficult without a thorough assessment of the economic benefits of these interventions.====Approaches to estimating the economic effects of health conditions include the cost of illness method, where the direct and indirect costs associated with a disease are calculated; the value of a statistical life (VSL) approach, where costs are inferred from willingness to pay studies or observed avoidance behaviour for risky occupations or scenarios; econometric estimates taken from cross-country growth regressions; and macroeconomic models (such as a production function-based approach or a general-equilibrium framework), where output trajectories for different scenarios are simulated. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. In our paper, we aim to account for the aggregate effects on output when estimating the full economic impact of non-communicable diseases. Therefore, we adopt a macroeconomic approach that incorporates disease prevalence into a human capital augmented production function. In this way, we can model the effects of chronic conditions on aggregate effective labour supply and on capital accumulation in a flexible framework that can be used to characterize an extensive set of pathways through which health affects the economy.==== In contrast to many of the individual-level studies on the economic burden of disease, our macroeconomic approach directly accounts for the salient substitution processes between labour, human capital, and physical capital, as well as the implied changes in factor productivity.====Our main contribution is to modify and extend the model that Abegunde and Stanciole (2006) first used to examine the impact of non-communicable diseases on economic growth. The original formulation of the basic projection tool named EPIC (or Projecting the Economic Cost of Ill Health) relied on the Solow (1956) framework and was designed by the World Health Organization (WHO).==== In this paper we propose a novel framework that builds upon the WHO EPIC tool, but additionally considers i) heterogeneous human capital levels of workers in different age groups, ii) that NCDs and health conditions not only lead to mortality but also to morbidity, and iii) the effect of treatment costs on capital accumulation.====While our analysis focuses on NCDs, the framework we develop here is quite general and could easily apply to other health domains, such as communicable diseases, road traffic accidents, and tobacco control. We focus on chronic conditions for several reasons. First, the data requirements to implement the model for the four NCDs that are the focus of the United Nations (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes) and mental health conditions are already quite substantial. Second, the countries we consider (China, Japan, and South Korea) are either middle- or high-income countries that have made great strides in dealing with communicable diseases. However, NCDs have received less attention from a public health perspective in these countries and, unlike communicable diseases, the prevalence of chronic conditions is expected to rise substantially over the coming decades. Finally, we are interested in assessing the economic impact of population ageing via changes in the health status of the population, and because age is an important non-modifiable risk factor for the NCDs that we consider, we believe that focusing on these conditions is appropriate. Nevertheless, we hope to extend the model to other aspects of health in future research.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 compares the four most popular methods used to assess the economic burden of different diseases and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Section 3 proposes a novel framework that builds upon the WHO EPIC tool, but additionally considers heterogeneous human capital levels of workers in different age groups, the morbidity effect of NCDs, and the effect of treatment costs on capital accumulation. Section 4 implements the model for China, Japan, and South Korea and presents the results for these three countries. Section 5 summarizes and draws conclusions.","The economic burden of chronic diseases: Estimates and projections for China, Japan, and South Korea",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300744,26 September 2018,2018,Research Article,127.0

Imputed rents show an obvious breakdown of intergenerational equity when we use an inter-age and intergenerational indicator. This indicator compares the per capita asset income at a given age with the average asset income of people aged 18–85. It gives the relative situation of one age group compared to its contemporaries and it also gives the relative situation of one generation when we compare birth cohorts over time. We find that the cohort born in 1950 benefited from a better position than their successors. Moreover, the cohorts born before the war and during the war appear to be even more favored than the baby-boomers. The cohorts born in 1930 and in 1940 have a better situation than the previous generations and a better position than the following generations.","The French PAYG system reached a peak in 2014. That year, public pensions accounted for 14.1% of GDP (Conseil d'Orientation des Retraites, 2017).==== From 2014 forward, that share should progressively fall, provided that the GDP growth rate maintains an acceptable level. If the GDP growth rate remains stable at 1.3%, pensions could account for 13.3% of GDP by 2050. A higher growth rate would result in a smaller share of GDP – for example, with a stable 1.8% growth rate, pensions as a share of GDP could fall to 12.1%. Contrary to popular belief, France has in fact implemented pension reforms to address the issue of population aging. Although the reforms were justified on grounds of sustainability, they will be costly for the pensioners. Replacement rates will decrease strongly from the 1950’s birth cohorts. Whereas a 68-year-old born in 1947 could count on a replacement rate of 54.3%, a 68-year-old born in 1980 will see his replacement rate fall to 47.5%.==== Consequently, future pensioners will have to find a solution to the conundrum: how to maintain its consumption level over time as public pensions decline. Should they rely on their families or on themselves? Family solidarity with transfers from younger generations to older generations is not a realistic solution in France. Nowadays, the direction of family transfers is the opposite. French pensioners transfer a net amount equivalent to 0.9% of GDP to younger generations.==== However, given that pensioners concentrate more assets than younger generations, another solution may come from retirees' assets.====In 2011, private asset income accounted for 17.1% of GDP, i.e. 3.6 points higher than public pensions for the same year, and the share of private asset income received by persons aged 60+ was 47.5%. However, French pensioners suffered from the low interest rates implied by the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. In 2016, long-term interest rates were lower than 0.47 % in France, while they were higher than 1.8% in the USA.====In a nutshell, future pensioners could suffer from pension reforms without any guarantee of benefiting from higher rates of return on their assets. It should be pointed out that the consumption level of pensioners is not restricted to monetary flow. It also includes imputed rents that are a significant part of private asset income. In 2011, rents accounted for 30.3% of total private asset income. Moreover, the share of homeownership increased significantly for people aged 50 and over between 1986 and 2010 (Arrondel et al., 2011). This increase was even greater for people aged 70 and over. People who bought their first home before the price boom that started in the late 1970s also benefited from a strong leverage effect.====We expect that the combined effects of pension reforms, housing prices, and the economic climate will strongly modify the allocation of asset income across generations. In France, the most recent studies on the allocation of consumption and labor income (D’Albis et al., 2017, D’Albis and Badji, 2017), on public transfers (Chojnicki et al., 2016, Navaux, 2016), and on financial wealth (Bernard and Berthet, 2015) showed no evidence of an intergenerational break to the benefit of the baby-boomers. However, these studies do not address the issue of the allocation of private asset income between age groups and generations.====Our study is focused on all these aspects of asset income. It deals with economic flows and with imputed rents. We use the National Transfer Account (NTA) methodology to investigate the issue of intergenerational equity. We introduce age profiles for financial and real estate income, household interest rates, capital income of self-employed individuals, and for imputed rents. The French NTA project has been conducted with the aim of measuring time series over the longest period, i.e. between 1979 and 2011. On this note, France has now joined the small group of countries that have constructed NTA time series, such as the United States (Donehower et al., 2011), Sweden (Lindh et al., 2011), Taiwan (Lai and Tung, 2015), and Australia (Temple et al., 2017). Access to long term time series for French age profiles is a necessary prerequisite for comparing several generations at the same age.====We introduce three indicators of intergenerational equity with the aim of obtaining a broad analysis of intergenerational differences. The first indicator describes the relative situation of an age group with respect to the situation of another age group over time. Our second indicator compares the standard of living of successive generations at the same age. The third indicator is a combination of the two previous criteria. It is both an inter-age indicator and also an intergenerational indicator. It computes relative measures of income by dividing net resources at age ==== and date ==== by their cross-sectional average.====This paper is organized as follows. The first section describes NTA methodology and the data sources for the age profiles. The second section introduces the three intergenerational equity indicators that we selected to analyze the NTA profiles.

Pessimism might lead to inadequate saving for retirement and an impoverished old age. It may also discourage investment in healthy living and preventive care that slow the deterioration of health in old age. Optimism may result in insufficient depletion of assets in old age and unplanned bequests.====The formation of accurate longevity expectations involves acquisition of health knowledge, perception of mortality risks and processing of information. These are cognitive skills that may be improved through education. Variation in ability to forecast the lifetime horizon over which finances are optimally planned may contribute to observed differences by education and cognition in saving, retirement and wealth management (Fang et al., 2008, Banks and Oldfield, 2007, Banks et al., 2010, Christelis et al., 2010, Smith et al., 2010, Behrman et al., 2012, Agarwal and Mazumder, 2013). It may also explain differences in health behavior by education (Kenkel, 1991, Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010).====This paper measures the accuracy of longevity expectations, and its heterogeneity by sex, education and cognition. It does so by comparing the subjective probabilities of living to 75 reported by Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants with an indicator of whether they survive to that age. Previous analyses of the HRS and other representative surveys demonstrate that subjective survival probabilities have power to predict survival to a subsequent wave (Van Doorn and Kasl, 1998, Smith et al., 2001, Hurd and McGarry, 2002, Siegel et al., 2003, Hurd et al., 2004, Hurd, 2009). While this confirms that the subjective predictions contain information on mortality risk, what it tells us about their accuracy is limited on three counts. First, there is a mismatch between the event respondents are asked to forecast (survival to a target age) and the outcome evaluated (survival to the next survey wave). Second, even if this deficiency is corrected, subjective probabilities of living to certain age can correlate with that outcome without being close, on average, to the actual survival rate. Optimal decision making requires that subjective probabilities correspond to the objective probabilities. Correlation is not sufficient. Third, the subjective probabilities may, on average, equal the objective probability and still they may discriminate poorly between those who survive and those who do not, such that both survivors and decedents make large prediction errors. This would indicate a high degree of uncertainty about longevity, which would be anticipated to influence behavior.====We use data and measures of prediction accuracy that address all three of these limitations. To deal with the first problem, we compare predictions and outcomes of the same event – survival to the age of 75 – that are observed for around 6750 HRS respondents followed over 22 years. We take care of the other two limitations by applying a measure of accuracy – the mean squared prediction error – that captures the extent to which a subjective probability corresponds to the actual survival rate among those reporting (====), as well as the degree to which the subjective probabilities distinguish those who survive from those who do not (====). We also evaluate and compare prediction calibration and discrimination separately, and we decompose the measure of accuracy to reveal the contribution that pure noise in the subjective probabilities makes to heterogeneity in accuracy across education and cognition groups.====We confirm that subjective probabilities of survival to 75 have power to predict survival to that age, and not merely survival to the next survey wave.==== However, accuracy of the predictions is very poor. For men, the predictions are even less accurate than everyone reporting a 50–50 chance of survival to 75. For women, they are not any better than this low benchmark. The poorer prediction performance of men is entirely due to their survival rate being closer to 50 percent, which means the outcome is more uncertain and so more difficult to predict. Both sexes underestimate their survival chances, but women do so to a far greater degree.====The survival predictions of the least educated and cognitively able are the least accurate. This is the net outcome of opposing differences. On the one hand, the predictions of the low education and cognition groups discriminate better between those who live to 75 and those who die. This is because these groups are more inclined toreport a zero chance of survival. On the other hand, the predictions of these groups are less well calibrated – their level corresponds less to the actual survival rate – and they display much more noise.==== Further, the higher mortality rate of the low education and cognition groups brings their survival closer to the 50% rate of maximum uncertainty. These three latter effects dominate. The education gradient in accuracy is much stronger than the cognition gradient for women. For men, the two gradients are similar.====Elder (2013) also argues that the subjective survival probabilities reported in the HRS are woefully inaccurate. His claim is partly based on an estimate that measurement error accounts for around two thirds of the cross-sectional variance in these probabilities. They contain a great deal of noise. We add that the signal-to-noise ratio is lowest for the least educated and cognitively able. Further, we offer a more complete, quantitative evaluation of accuracy and its components: calibration, discrimination, noise and outcome uncertainty.====Delavande and Rohwedder (2011) are considerably more positive regarding the information content of subjective survival probabilities. They show that the wealth gradient in these probabilities is remarkably similar to the gradient in actual survival in the HRS. However, the gradient in the subjective probabilities by education is markedly shallower than that in actual survival (see their online Appendix). We confirm that this is because there is greater downward bias in the expectations of better educated males. But bias is not a sufficiently comprehensive measure of accuracy. It allows positive and negative errors to cancel. Aggregating all prediction errors, we demonstrate that it is the least educated who report the least accurate survival probabilities.====By fitting a parametric model, Bissonnette et al. (2017) are able to test and reject the restriction that a subjective survival curve estimated from reported survival probabilities to various target ages traces an objective survival curve estimated from the within sample mortality of HRS respondents. However, the median subjective curve does not deviate too much from the median objective curve, and mean life expectancies simulated from the subjective and objective curves are reasonably close. In interpreting these more encouraging results, one must keep in mind that they essentially tell us about bias and ignore the variance of the prediction errors. Our measure of accuracy, which is obtained directly from the data non-parametrically, captures both bias and variance. We show that excess variance (unrelated to survival) in the probabilities reported by the least educated and cognitively able is a major contributor to the lower accuracy of these groups.====The lower capacity of the least cognitively able to form accurate expectations about longevity, and possibly other prospects, may contribute to the strong positive correlation between cognitive functioning and the quality of decision-making (Choi et al., 2014). Heterogeneity in the accuracy of these expectations may also partly explain the difficulty that individuals with low education and numeracy skills have in valuing an annuity (Brown et al., 2017). By using data on survey-reported longevity expectations to estimate a subjective survival curve and feeding this into a lifecycle model of consumption, Heimer et al. (2017) show that pessimism about survival chances at younger ages and optimism at older ages respectively explain under-saving before retirement and suboptimal depletion of assets after retirement. They find that the deviation from the optimal consumption path induced by based survival beliefs is greater at lower levels of education. Bissonnette et al. (2017) find something similar using HRS data. They calculate that the median female (male) high school dropout would need to be given 14% (12%) of her wealth to compensate for the losses incurred by following a consumption path consistent with her subjective survival curve rather than following the one that is optimal given her objective survival curve. For the median female (male) college graduate, the respective compensation is substantially lower in relative terms – 4% (7%) of wealth. There is substantial variation around these median estimates. For one quarter of the least educated women (men), the loss is over 600% (80%) of wealth.====Such estimates are predicated on the assumption that economic decisions are actually taken on the basis of beliefs about longevity captured by the survival probabilities reported in surveys. The motivation for this paper is also founded on that assumption. There is evidence that reported longevity expectations correlate (conditional on covariates) with saving (Hurd et al., 1998, Puri and Robinson, 2007, Salm, 2010, Heimer et al., 2017), as well as work hours (Puri and Robinson, 2007), early retirement (Hurd et al., 2004), annuity purchases (Inkmann et al., 2010) and portfolio choice (Puri and Robinson, 2007, Spaenjers and Spira, 2015). These correlations are consistent with reported expectations being reflections of beliefs that influence economic behavior, although they certainly do not confirm this interpretation.====Like Bissonnette et al. (2017), we quantify the losses that would be incurred if decisions were based on the inaccurate subjective predictions of longevity made by HRS respondents. Using a simple normative model that captures the structure of some decision problems that would optimally make use of longevity expectations, we measure and compare the value of the survival probabilities reported relative to a scenario in which everyone decides on the basis of the mean survival rate.==== With this approach, prediction value depends on the cost of insuring longevity risk relative to the loss incurred if it is not insured and the relevant cost/loss ratio is potentially individual-specific. Over most of the range of this ratio, we find that welfare would be higher if everyone were to use the mean survival rate rather than each using their reported survival probability. Using period life table probabilities, which vary with age and sex only and underestimate survival in the HRS cohort, would also generate more value than the subjective survival probabilities. The losses arising from use of the latter can be substantial, although there are instances in which they are more valuable than both the sample mean and the life table probabilities. Despite the predictions of the least educated being the least accurate, they are not of least value in decision-making over the full range of the cost/loss ratio. However, at the extremes where overly pessimistic and optimistic beliefs result in large losses of welfare, it is the least educated who lose most as a result of being most prone to these widely inaccurate predictions.====In summary, our contribution to evidence on subjective predictions of longevity is fourfold. First, by using a longer follow-up period, we are able to compare predicted survival to 75 with actual survival to that age for a large number of HRS respondents. This allows us to measure prediction accuracy non-parametrically directly from the data by comparing an event outcome (survival to 75) with its prediction at the individual level. Consequently, without imposing distributional assumptions and specification restrictions, we can identify the direction in which longevity expectations are biased and quantify their degree of accuracy, neither of which can be inferred from the association between reported probabilities of living to 75 and survival to the next survey wave.==== Second, we examine different dimensions of prediction accuracy – calibration, discrimination and skill, i.e. accuracy net of prediction difficulty arising from the degree of outcome uncertainty – as well as the noise that contributes to inaccuracy. This helps us understand why accuracy varies and also to speculate about its consequences for decision-making. Third, we document heterogeneity in the accuracy of longevity expectations by education and cognition, as well as sex. In doing so, we move beyond the question of whether a representative agent possesses and can process information on longevity prospects that are instrumental to solving lifecycle planning problems. We address a question that has a distributional motivation: which individuals are more likely to hold inaccurate expectations and, consequently, may be most prone to making suboptimal decisions? Fourth, we assess not only the accuracy of longevity predictions but also their value in decision-making. As far as we are aware, the approach we take to assess prediction value has not previously been used to evaluate survey-reported subjective probabilities for longevity or any other outcome.====In the next section, we explain how we select samples from the HRS and describe the measurement and distributions of the two key variables – subjective probability of survival to 75 and actual survival to that age. In the third section, we evaluate the accuracy of predicted survival by sex and education, and then also by cognition. We start this section by examining the calibration and discriminatory power of the predictions, before quantifying, comparing and decomposing overall accuracy on the basis of the mean square prediction error. In the fourth section, we assess prediction value by sex and education.",Who can predict their own demise?

This reflects pension reforms that lead to changing pension levels, but also changes in the working lives leading to postponement of the retirement resulted from these reforms. The postponement of the introduction of changes which leads to the adjustment of the total pension transfers to younger cohorts can create pressure for more rapid reforms and higher variability of pension incomes between cohorts in the future. The pension incomes were also affected by the adjustments after financial and economic crisis in 2008. In the paper, we use age-period-cohort (APC) decomposition to measure the cohort effects of the age profiles of pension income changes of people born between 1927 and 1962 in Austria, Germany, Hungary, Poland and Sweden. The selected countries represent different labour market and pension systems characteristics. We analyse the cohort effects using the pension age profiles estimated according to the NTA approach in the period 2005–2013. Our analysis shows that there are cohorts effects are declining for younger cohorts. These negative effects are off-set by increasing age coefficients. This is, among others, the result of increasing retirement age and prolonging working lives. The adjustment of the pension levels to actuarially fair values was more visible and observed even before the crisis in countries with defined contribution or point system. Finally, the period effects indicate some reaction to the economic crisis.","Population ageing is most advanced in the European countries. With the rise of the share of population in ages 50 and over, the European Union and country strategies focus on policies that help to accommodate to these changes through actions aimed at prolonging working lives and increasing ages at which people retire. Pension systems are also reformed. Countries introduce reforms that aim at improving financial sustainability of pension systems, including modification of pension formulae as well as level of pension indexation. These changes affect pension incomes of individual cohorts.====In the paper, we analyse how pension income of men and women born in 1962 and earlier changed between 2005 and 2013, decomposing these changes to age, period and cohort effects. Such decomposition allows us to identify how different policy measures, adopted in the four countries affect the average pension income received by different cohorts at different ages in subsequent years.====The five countries that we analyse represent different economic, demographic and social types. Austria, Germany and Sweden are developed western and northern EU economies, while Poland and Hungary are economic transition countries from Central and Eastern Europe. The social models also differ: Austria and Germany represent continental type, Sweden – social-democratic Scandinavian model, Hungary and Poland are countries with relatively underdeveloped social models. All of the countries face pronounced population ageing. According to the Eurostat projections, by 2060 Austria, Hungary, Germany and Poland will have old-age dependency ratios above the EU average. In Sweden, situation will be more favourable, however in 2013 the old-age dependency rate in Sweden was one of the highest (European Commission DG ECFIN, 2015).====Countries in Europe undertake reforms to face the challenge of population ageing. This includes prolonging working lives and promoting higher participation of people above 50==== ====years of age in the labour market. Pension reforms are frequently associated with increasing pensionable ages, but also reducing replacement rates or keeping pension indexation close to price levels. Our sample of countries includes those that have undertaken pension reforms in late 1990s and beginning of the century. These reforms link the benefits to the changes in demographic situation: Poland and Sweden introduced notional defined-contribution systems in 1999, which means that benefits depend on life expectancy. Germany, since the turn of the century reformed the pension system, introducing the demographic coefficients in the point system. On the other hand: Austria and Hungary maintain systems that are based fully on pay-as-you-go principle with defined benefit calculation.====The assessment of the impact of the structural reforms on labour market and in pensions area can be looked at from two sides: labour market activity and pension take up. The labour market and pension systems are two sides of the same coin. Thus, in order to have a full picture on how the recent reforms affected cohorts covered by the reforms we need to have these two perspectives. We look at the effects of these changes through the lenses of labour income and pension income.====The paper is structured as follows. First, we present changes that were introduced in pension systems and labour market characteristics in the analysed countries: employment rates and wage levels. Then, we present the analytical method that we use, that is age-period-cohort (APC) models. In the subsequent part, we present and analyse the obtained results and an attempt to explain those results. At the end, we formulate conclusions related to the impact of changes in pension systems on the pension incomes of affected cohorts.",Pension reforms or consequences of the economic crisis?

Iparraguirre Jose Luis,"Chief Economist, Age UK, London, United Kingdom","Available online 16 July 2017, Version of Record 23 November 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeoa.2017.07.001,Cited by (7),"This paper investigates whether there is a statistical association between spending per person in community-based adult social care for older people and the probability that an older person has unmet needs. Two definitions of unmet needs are introduced: a) if an individual who had difficulty with one or more ADLs/IADLs did not receive any help at all or if they received help, it did not always meet their need to perform the activity or activities, and b) only considering people who received help. Using two-level and cross-classified panel logistic regressions on data from the English ==== of Ageing between 2004/05 and 2012/13, the paper finds that a fall of 29 per cent in expenditure on community-based care for older people per head would lead to an increase of 6.1 per cent or 9.7 percent in the proportion of older people with unmet needs, depending on the definition of unmet needs: contractions in public spending make many older people experience the double plight of having social care needs and not being able to meet them in full. In view of demographic projections–of proportions of older people, of changes in household size and structure, and of geographical residence patterns within family members- unpaid long-term care will lag increasingly behind the needs of the older population; further budgetary reductions are likely to negatively affect particularly older people on low incomes.","Despite the increase in the proportion of older people in the population in England – the resident population aged 65 or over, for example, grew by 11.3 per cent between 2011 and 2015 (ONS, 2016) – the number of older people who need help to perform daily activities such as getting up and down stairs, having a bath or a shower, using the toilet, or doing routine housework has gone down over this period. For example, 9.7 per cent fewer older people needed help with getting up and down stairs in 2015 compared to 2011 (from 2,273,232 people down to 2,053,545), 14.7 per cent needed help with having a bath or a shower (down from 1,461,831 older people in 2011), and so on (Jones, 2016). In fact, more adults aged 65 or over were having difficulty only with taking medicine in 2015 than in 2011 (591,000 against 523,700, respectively), but again the numbers had gone down by 9.2 per cent in 2015 compared to a peak in 2013, when over 650,000 people aged 65 or over had difficulty with this activity of daily living.====This positive finding should not mask the relevance of the problem: about 2 million people need help with negotiating stairs, shopping for food, or doing routine housework; almost 1 million cannot get in and out of bed without help; and around 400,000 find it difficult to cut up food or use the toilet unless they get help.====Having social care needs is serious enough, but even more so is not having one’s needs met. Dunatchik et al. (2016) reported that 58 per cent of older people who need help have unmet needs. Forder (2007) estimated that there were 450,000 people aged 65 or over in England with unmet social care needs (around 5.5 per cent of the population aged 65 or over) in 2006, and predicted that even with increases in wealth among this age group, the levels of unmet needs would also increase if public funding were reduced or eligibility thresholds were raised. Since then, public funding on adult social care was reduced and eligibility thresholds were raised====: Innes and Tetlow (2015) reported that local authorities in England introduced cuts to net service spending per person amounting to around 23.4 per cent in real terms over the period 2009–10 to 2014–15, and that even spending on social care services, which comparatively were afforded relative protection, went down, per person, by 16.7 per cent. NAO (2014a) found that around 74 per cent of the fall in spending between 2010–11 and 2012–13 has resulted in reductions in the volume of care provided. Fernández et al. (2013) observed that reductions in social care services between 2005–6 and 2012–13 were particularly acute among older people and that the biggest reductions in the number of recipients took place among community-based clients compared to older people in residential and nursing homes. Using the same definition as adopted in this paper, Age UK (2014) estimated that 1,004,000 older people aged 65 and over have unmet social care needs in England (roughly 10.3 per cent of the whole population aged 65 or over), of whom around 91,000 experience difficulty with 3 or more activities of daily living (see also Iparraguirre, 2015).====Vlachantoni et al. (2011) echoed these concerns that spending cuts in adult social care increase the proportion of older people with unmet social care needs, but did not attempt to investigate whether that was the case or to what extent.====Within this background, this paper focuses on whether there is a statistical association between change in the spending per person in community-based adult social care and the number of older people in England with unmet needs.====The remainder of this article is structured in five sections.

The relatively large current account surplus at the beginning of the 2000s would have been substantially reduced because of ageing even without the concurrent structural problems in the export ====. The declining share of wage earners in the population reduces the ====, which in turn contributes to shrink the current account surplus. Population ageing is creating pressure for change in the level and structure of consumption as well as in relative prices. The growing need for public health and old-age care services presents a considerable challenge for public finances. It is essential that the labour supply is substantially increased in order that current levels of consumption can be maintained. The current level and age pattern of consumption relative to earnings must be adjusted in order to make them sustainable in the long term.","In the global economic downturn that has followed the 2008 financial crisis, Finland’s output and growth performance have been slower to rebound than in its neighbouring Nordic countries and in most other EU countries (OECD, 2016). In this article we will argue that one potential explanation for Finland’s slow recovery lies in demographics. Both domestic and international commentators agree that the outlook for the Finnish economy is dampened by current and foreseeable demographic trends (MoF, 2013, EC, 2013, OECD, 2015a, OECD, 2015b). However, analyses of the reasons for the prolonged recession following the financial crisis have given only marginal attention to the role of demographics.====In this article we examine, first, how Finnish macroeconomic development since the millennium has been impacted by population ageing; and second, what impacts can be expected in the future given the baseline population projection. Population ageing exerts a significant impact on the national savings rate (public and private net lending), the current account, demand and supply structure, and relative prices. Our analyses of these issues use the tools of the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) to measure intergenerational resource flows based on observed age profiles of income and consumption. The NTA system is consistent with the System of National Accounts (Mason and Lee, 2011).====Most earlier analyses of macroeconomic development in Finland since the 2008 financial crisis are framed by the rise-and-fall story of ICT giant Nokia. In addition, reference is often made to the troubled forest industry (see Holmström et al., 2014, OECD, 2016). Finland’s price competitiveness has declined throughout the 2000s. At the same time, the ICT cluster has been plunged into a productivity crisis. The decline in competitiveness is most readily apparent in the slide in the external or current account balance that has continued to deteriorate for more than a decade, and in the Finnish economy turning from a net lender to a net borrower in 2011 (Kajanoja, 2012, Maliranta and Vihriälä, 2013).====The deterioration of the external balance is a general equilibrium phenomenon resulting from adverse shocks to export industries and factors determining absorption relative to domestic supplies. Lifecycle considerations are particularly important in this respect: workers save individually and through the pension system to smooth consumption over their lifetime, while retirees dis-save through the same channels. The declining share of wage earners in the population reduces the savings rate, which in turn contributes to reduce the current account surplus. Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996) show in an overlapping generations model that ageing caused by a decline in fertility decreases the net savings of an economy.====Higgins (1998) has presented an econometric analysis of the relationship between age distribution, national savings and the current account balance with a sample of 100 countries. His results point to substantial demographic effects, with increases in both the youth and old-age dependency ratios associated with lower savings rates. The estimation results indicate that demographics have differential effects on savings and investment and therefore impact the current account balance. In a number of countries the estimated demographic effect on the current account balance over the last three decades exceeds 6% of GDP. Using out of sample projections based on expected demographic trends, he anticipates that these effects will probably be even greater over the coming decades.====Ferrero (2010) has used a multiregional overlapping generation model to analyse the impacts of demographics coupled with differences in productivity growth and fiscal policies on external balance in 1970–2005. He found that demographic differentials imply a non-negligible and nearly permanent external deficit for the US relative to major industrialised economies, whereas fiscal policy differentials are of minor importance. According to Ferrero’s simulation exercise, differences in life expectancy, rather than population growth rates, are the main demographic factor responsible for country differences in saving patterns.====These simulations abstract from structural changes in the modelled economies. Relative price changes in the domestic economy provide an additional mechanism for explaining the macroeconomic effects of demographic change. For purposes of studying these impacts on the external balance of an economy, it is useful to distinguish between industries that are open to international competition and those that are sheltered from international competition, since demographics have different effects on their demand. Due to competition, tradable industries must take international prices as a given, while domestic industries can pass through their costs into their prices. When total demand increases relative to domestic production, relative prices in the non-tradable sector will rise and the real exchange rate will become revalued. The amount of movement seen in domestic prices will depend on the supply of foreign substitutes (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1996).====Changes in age structure affect the structure of demand. American and European consumption studies based on individual-level data have found that compared with the working age population, older people spend more of their money on services protected from foreign competition (Hobijn and Lagakos, 2003, van Ewijk and Volkerink, 2012).====Individual-level data provide only an incomplete picture of the incidence of consumption, however, since they do not tend to take account of public consumption. Public consumption consists of health care and long-term care services. It is, in very large part, publicly subsidised or produced consumption that is not included in consumer surveys’ household consumption figures. A major part of the population using such services is excluded from household surveys. In OECD countries health care expenditure accounts for an average of 10% of GDP. One-third of these services are privately financed. Hagist and Kotlikoff (2005) estimated the age profiles of health care expenditure and concluded that older people’s per capita health care expenses are several times higher than those of the working aged.====Econometric time series and cross-section studies of the real exchange rate have found that the declining dependency ratio has increased the relative prices of non­tradables (Braude, 2000, Groneck and Kaufmann, 2014). Groneck and Kaufmann (2014) used a group of OECD countries to see how relative prices reacted to changes in the dependency ratio. They estimated that a 10% increase in the elderly support ratio would raise relative prices in the closed sector by 6–13%. Based on a review of a larger group of countries, Braude (2000) estimated that a country’s prices will rise by 10–15% if the dependency ratio increases by 10%.====In what follows, we begin by presenting a concise description of economic developments in Finland in the 2000s, both before the financial crisis and during the prolonged recession that followed. We recount the established interpretation of Finland’s export-driven crisis and consider the question of how demographic changes in the country could be linked to recent economic developments. Next, we proceed to describe the National Transfer Accounts system as well as the breakdown of income and consumption by age in the Finnish economy. Based on this breakdown, we explore the connection between the population age structure and macroeconomic development in the 2000s. Finally, we discuss some issues raised by this review regarding Finland’s demographic and economic outlook.",Finland’s slow recovery from the financial crisis: A demographic explanation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X16300585,16 June 2017,2017,Research Article,134.0

Falling can not only lead to disability, loss of independence, and admission to nursing homes, but a stay at the hospital after falling can bring on other ailments.==== What takes seconds to occur can lead to dire consequences. That being said, the type of fall is important: whether the fall resulted in an injury, for example, whether the individual fell for the first time, and the number of falls an individual has experienced prior to the fall all play a role in the severity of the outcomes in question.====According to the United States Census Bureau, people 65==== ====years of age and older made up 14.5% (46,243,211/318,857,056) of the population in 2014.==== Falls among older individuals can result in direct injury and medical costs due to the fall. They may also result in death, disability, nursing-home admission, prolonged hospitalization, or indirect medical issues and costs (Stevens, 2006, Bell et al., 2000). Direct medical care costs totaled $0.2 billion for fatal and $19.2 billion for non-fatal fall related injuries among people over the age of 65 (Stevens et al. 2006). These figures reflect what patients and insurance companies pay and do not include indirect costs associated with poor subsequent physical and mental health outcomes; thus, the full costs associated with falls among older individuals are much higher. Fig. 1 shows proposed mechanisms.====A fall for an older individual can be a shock, as it happens so quickly and can be fatal (Sterling et al. 2001), yet it has the potential to be relatively easy to prevent if it means providing funding for home modification measures. Falling is not a shock in the sense that it has an endogenous quality to it, and not all older individuals are equally likely to fall. It is a symptom of an issue with postural stability and causes can be complex.

Structural endogeneity may arise as poor health may increase the probability of falling. Yet ====, one who falls suffers worse outcomes in the subsequent years. Estimating the magnitudes of these outcomes employing appropriate sources of identification is the main goal of this study. Using the 1998–2012 waves of the Health and Retirement Study and several econometric methods, this study seeks to answer the question of how much worse physical and mental health outcomes are for older individuals who have experienced a fall. Hazard models predicting the probability of death after a fall are also run.

In particular, focus is on unpaid work that is also typically performed away from home, such as child care. We value unpaid work using the delegation or third party criterion (Reid, 1934; Donehower, 2014).====We find that men work longer hours in household enterprises and earn more than women, but the reverse is true on the farm. The imputed wage incomes from unpaid work on the farm vary by gender and age over the life course, with men’s imputed wage-income profiles dominating women’s at older ages. General policy implications of the findings are briefly discussed.","Margaret Reid starts her seminal book on the ‘economics of household production’ by noting that although the “household is our most important institution” (Reid, 1934, p. v), little is known about the value of the goods and services produced by the household or the value of the effort employed to that end. Her book identifies three key functions that a household performs: reproduction, harmonization of social relationships, and meeting the daily needs of its members. Reid observes that satisfaction of daily needs of household members is the essence of household production, and is accomplished through employment of unpaid work. The definition of unpaid work and its valuation as done here is in the methodology section.====The present paper falls within the intergenerational economy literature recently summarized by Lee and Mason (2011). Unpaid work received its first global attention at a World Summit for Social Development (United Nations, 1995) and later found its place in the UN Sustainable Development Goals which replaced the Millennium Development Goals in September 2015. Within the stand-alone Goal 5 on gender equality, the subsection 5.4 recognizes the need to count and value unpaid work, especially the work performed by women. The emphasis on unpaid work is motivated by the need to correct the current pro-male bias in the market economy, despite the large unrecorded, non-market contributions made by women outside of the activities that are captured by the system of national accounts (SNA). It is also important to note, as in Waring (1999), that the national income accounts give a misleading picture of the size of the economy because the unpaid work, especially by women is ignored.====According to Hoskyns and Rai (2007) and Abertini et al. (2007), the unpaid work of women at home and in the community is the glue that keeps households and societies together. In Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, women are generally restricted to carrying out unpaid work within the home despite the fact that African governments recognize human capital formation is enhanced by performance of market activities Blackden and Wodon (2006).====The current labor force participation in Kenya gives a picture that suggests that women participation is at a lower rate than men’s Suda (2002). This picture changes drastically when women’s non-market work is counted. Women in rural Kenya, for instance, spend on average 23 per cent more time in crop activities than do men. Apart from what they do in agriculture, Kenyan women in rural areas spend about 40 per cent of their time collecting water, averaging, about 3–5.25==== ====h per day (AfDB, 2007). Githinji (2000) found that Kenyan women work nearly 33 per cent more hours than adult men in all tasks put together. An additional insight into labor force participation by sex in Kenya is provided by Wanjala and Were (2009) who used the 2003 Kenya Social Accounting Matrix to simulate the employment effects of investing in priority sectors identified in Vision 2030 – the country’s development blueprint over the next fifteen years. The findings of that study demonstrate that males benefit from creation of skilled, well-paying jobs at the disadvantage of women who often support men through their unpaid work on the farm and at home, and with the earnings they derive from the informal sector.====The sole objective of this paper is to count and value unpaid work by gender and age in Kenya using the National Time Transfer Accounts (NTTA) methodology developed by Donehower (2014). The methodology is applied with significant adaption to ====-time use data extracted from the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey conducted by the Government of Kenya in 2005, and from the administrative data obtained from the Government of Kenya official Gazette, published in 2015 (Republic of Kenya, 2015).

The often-overlooked mechanism of intergenerational transfers, however, can dampen these intended policy effects, as adult children who make income contributions to their parents could adjust their behavior in response to changes in their parents’ income. Exploiting a unique policy intervention in China, we examine using a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) approach how a new pension program impacts inter vivos transfers. We show that pension benefits lower the propensity of adult children to transfer income to elderly parents in the context of a large middle-income country, and we also estimate a small crowd-out effect. Taken together, these estimates fit the pattern of previous research in high-income countries, although our estimates of the crowd-out effect are significantly smaller than previous studies in both middle- and high-income countries. (JEL D64, O15; O16; J14; J22; H55, R2).","How family members respond to public transfers can play an important role in assessing the efficiency and welfare impact of redistributive policies on the welfare of the elderly. Of particular concern is the possibility that public transfers induce a reduction in private family transfers, thereby dampening the redistributive effect of public transfers and resulting in an overall reduction of available savings, and thus welfare.==== This scenario is exceptionally relevant to developing countries and rapidly growing economies, such as China, where such crowd-out effects can affect millions of elderly people, many of whom live in poverty. China is a particularly compelling setting to examine intergenerational transfers because of the country’s high age dependency ratio, with a large elderly cohort and relatively small working-age population, due to the only recently relaxed one-child policy (World Bank, 2017). The World Bank (2001) estimates that expanding formal safety nets and public transfer programs in developing countries will likely displace private transfers by 20 to 91 percent. Previous empirical studies that examine the magnitude of crowd-out effects on inter vivos private transfers provide mixed evidence or some support for positive small crowd-out effects (Lucas and Stark, 1985, Cox, 1987, Cox and Rank, 1992, Cox and Jakubson, 1995, McGarry and Schoeni, 1995, Altonji et al., 1997, Cox et al., 1998), although these studies are largely based on the experience of high-income countries. Evidence on the existence and magnitude of crowd-out effects in emerging and middle-income economies, such as China, is extremely limited.====In this paper, we examine the impact of China’s New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) on inter vivos private transfers (from children to parents and vice versa), particularly among adults in the age group of 60 years and above.==== The NRPS program was introduced in 2009 in response to rising demographic and old-age poverty concerns in the last decade (Liu and Sun, 2016, Holzman et al., 2009: 111–18).==== In 2007, approximately 11 percent of China’s population was in the age group of 60 years and above, making up 21 percent of the world’s elderly population (UN, 2007). Similar to other developing countries, the Chinese government faced additional pressing challenges: large rural and informal agricultural populations, high internal migration flows (Sabates-Wheeler and Koettl 2010), and weak institutions (Musalem and Ortiz 2011). The new program,==== a defined-contribution pension program, was made available to all rural residents who were 16 years of age or older. In this study, we examine the program’s impacts on inter vivos transfers using various quasi-experimental techniques.==== We use a large panel dataset from which we focus on a cohort of individuals whose data on program participation and inter vivos transfers are rich. The eligibility of an individual for the program was based on his/her contributions and age. Our identification strategy relies on within-country variation in program implementation due to the staggered implementation of the policy across communities. We use this staggered implementation as a source of identifying variation, to detect the impact of this program on pension participation between those individuals living in newly integrated communities between 2011 and 2013 and those individuals who were not offered similar program benefits. We use a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) empirical strategy to estimate the intent-to-treat (ITT) program’s impact on access to pension benefits on individual-level outcomes. We also instrument the individual’s program participation with a community variable related to the availability of the program. Finally, because of the potential right-censoring in our outcome variable, we use a censoring-data adjustment based on Cameron and Trivedi (2005).====Using data from 2009 to 2013 from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we find a statistically significant impact of the availability of NRPS benefits on lowering the probability of the incidence of receiving a transfer from adult children by 7.4 percentage points and a lowering of the actual amount of transfers by 10.4 percent.==== We do not detect statistically significant evidence that the benefits’ availability impacted transfers sent to children. The small amount of evidence provided by previous studies in developing countries supports our findings that elderly pension benefits tend to crowd-out private transfers received.==== In addition, we find that the receipt of benefits had a significant effect on the intensive and extensive margins of private transfers. More specifically, NRPS benefit recipients were 10.4 percentage points (55.1 percent) less likely to receive transfers. And the receipt of benefits was associated with a decline in transfers of about 18.8 percent of the average transfer amount. Similarly, we did not find that the receipt of benefits affected private transfers sent to children. Finally, using Tobit analysis for the right-censored outcome measures, we investigate the magnitude of the crowd-out effect. We find a crowd-out effect of − 0.03 (imprecisely estimated====), suggesting that family members do offset their inter vivos transfers to elderly parents in response to pension benefits, but that substitution is extremely small in magnitude and much smaller than previously estimated using data from middle- and high-income countries.====Previous empirical studies have examined the substitution between the availability of public saving options and subsequent intergenerational transfers and have reported mixed results.==== Studies that examine the relationship between public transfers and inter vivos transfers in the context of high-income countries (Cox, 1987, Cox and Rank, 1992, Lucas and Stark, 1985, Cox et al., 1998, Cox and Jakubson, 1995, McGarry and Schoeni, 1995, Altonji et al., 1997) find evidence of substitution, with estimated impacts on the probability of transfers ranging from −0.01 to 0.015 (probability of decreased incidence of an inter vivos transfer).==== In contrast to these findings, studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries (Cox et al., 2004, Juarez, 2009, Gerardi and Tsai, 2014, Jung et al., 2016) also find evidence of substitution effects, but the estimated substitution response tends to be much higher for public programs in developing countries than those in high-income countries. Therefore, the potential welfare consequences of behavioral responses to newly introduced pension benefits in a large country are enormous. Furthermore, because of its rapidly aging population and a public saving option that has been recently introduced in its rural areas, China is a particularly compelling setting for this study.====This paper makes four important contributions to the existing empirical literature on inter vivos transfers and the possible crowd-out effects between various forms of saving. First, we contribute to the existing literature on intergenerational transfers in low- and middle-income countries, and we are among the first set of studies to shed light on how pension benefits influence inter vivos transfers in the context of a very large middle-income country.==== In this study, we focus on China, which is the world’s most populated country. The setting of this study makes the consequences of our results important from a welfare standpoint.==== Worldwide, aging populations have prompted policy responses to alleviate old-age poverty. China’s rural elderly have predominantly been without public assistance until the NRPS, making China a setting ripe to study the effects of an elderly pension program on private transfers. Thus, examining the potential behavioral response to the receipt of pension benefits in the context of the world’s largest country has important implications for the design of public assistance programs in other highly populated and developing countries. Our second contribution relates to our program’s estimated impact on the incidence of interhousehold transfers in response to pension benefits. All three studies that use data from middle-income countries do not explicitly test for impacts of these programs on the incidence of new transfers and instead focus on the crowd-out effect.==== We find a very small (relative to previous studies from middle-income countries) and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of inter vivos transfers to the elderly.==== Third, previous studies that rely on data from middle-income countries (Juarez, 2009, Jensen, 2004, Gibson et al., 2011) show a large crowd-out effect in response to pension benefits. Although our estimates are in line with the overall substitution pattern of the estimated crowd-out effect from middle-income countries, we find much smaller crowd-out effects (imprecisely estimated) than that of previous empirical studies using data from middle-income countries. Our fourth contribution relates to our large sample size when compared to studies from low- and middle-income countries. We rely on data from almost 12,000 households. Finally, we examine for heterogeneous effects, by household’s income status, due to the introduction of the public program on the incidence and crowd-out effect of private transfers. Although we do not detect differential impacts when we formally test for equality of the crowd-out effect by household’s income status, we do detect a larger decrease in the incidence of private transfers among high-income households.====This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the background for rural pension programs in China and on the NRPS in particular. Section 3 presents a conceptual framework for intergenerational transfers. Section 4 presents a summary of the data and the study sample.

These inequalities have been remarkably persistent in the face of policy actions that try to reduce inequality (Costa-Font and Hernández-Quevedo, 2012, Font et al., 2011, Victora, 2000) and there has been a call for improved policies to address and reduce health inequalities (Evans, 2001, Carr, 2004, Organization, 2000). In principle, health inequality could be defined as the differences in health across people (Gakidou et al., 2000) in much the same way as income inequality is defined as the differences in income across people. However, in social epidemiology, health inequality is usually defined in terms of differences in health across different socio-economic groups, that is, the gradient in health with socioeconomic status (Berkman et al., 2014).====This raises the issue of how to measure socio-economic status and a variety of approaches have been developed in the literature. A natural approach is to use household income as a metric. However measuring household income in surveys from developing countries is difficult. As a consequence, studies concerning child health have relied on a wealth index based on housing characteristics and ownership of consumer durables (Filmer and Pritchett, 2001). The use of this proxy measure has been based on the argument that the wealth index is highly correlated with household income per capita and that child health gradients are similar with both socioeconomic measures. Subsequent studies have confirmed that while the relationship between households ranked by quintiles of wealth and consumption measures is imperfect, child health gradients are similar in both approaches (Wagstaff and Watanabe, 2003). However more recent studies show that gradients in health care utilization may differ using the two approaches (Lindelow, 2006) and that the exact composition of the assets used to construct the index matters (Howe et al., 2008, Montgomery, 2000).====The wealth index approach to measuring socioeconomic status has been mainly used in child health studies. However, recent studies have explored adult health gradients using a household wealth index and found either no, or only a very small gradient, in many countries (Debpuur, 2010, Hirve, 2010, Kyobutungi et al., 2010, Mwanyangala, 2010, Ng, 2010, Razzaque, 2010, Van Minh, 2010, Xavier Gómez-Olivé, 2010). This conclusion has potentially important consequences for how we think about the health of the elderly and health policy. However, unlike the case of child health there has been little evaluation of how the health gradient using the wealth index compares to gradients in household income or consumption for adult and elderly health.====To address this issue, we use data from the first wave of the Health and Aging in Africa: A longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa (HAALSI) that provides data on health outcomes, household consumption, and the household wealth index, to compare health gradients using different measures of socioeconomic status. We model our approach closely on previous work on this population by Gomez-Olive et al. (Xavier Gómez-Olivé, 2010) to provide comparability to our results. We construct three different summary measures of health and disability status; each based on a different collection of health variables. We measure socioeconomic status using household consumption adjusted for household size. There is an issue that consumption per capita may not be a good measure of household socioeconomic status if some consumption goods are shared within the family, and there are economies of scale in household consumption. Wagstaff and Watanabe (Wagstaff and Watanabe, 2003) suggest equivalent consumption, defined as consumption divided by the square root of household size, as a better indicator of household wellbeing. We find much stronger health gradients in equivalent consumption than consumption per capita.====While there is evidence of a mortality gradient with the wealth index (Kabudula, 2017), previous work in Agincourt (Xavier Gómez-Olivé, 2010) finds a shallow adult health gradient in the wealth index when not adjusting for the other covariates, and no gradient when adjusting for covariates. From a policy perspective the adjusted gradient is more important. Some of the unadjusted health gradient may be due to the correlation of socioeconomic status with exogenous personal characteristics that affect health, for example, sex, age, marital status, and national origin, which are unlikely to be affected by policies. In our analysis we also adjust the gradient for education status. There may be very long run policies to reduce health inequality in the elderly by equalizing educational opportunities; by controlling for education we rule this out and focus on the potential effect of policies that address inequality in the current generation of elderly whose education levels can be considered fixed. This is the appropriate adjustment to find the potential impact of polices, such as pensions social grants, that redistribute income and consumption to the elderly (Exworthy et al., 2003, Marmot, 2002, Marmot, 2012).====Our result undermines the use of the wealth index alone as a proxy for household consumption when studying health gradients in adult and elderly health. We find much steeper gradients in health in equivalent consumption, than in the wealth index, suggesting the potential for a much larger health impact for policies that redistribute income. Further, our results emphasize the need for studies that collect detailed household consumption data, as well as recording the asset holdings needed for the wealth index.",Health inequalities in the South African elderly: The importance of the measure of social-economic status,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300768,30 January 2019,2019,Research Article,141.0

This pattern of higher self-employment rates may reflect lower rates of retirement among the self-employed compared to employees, as well as transitions into self-employment at older ages. While the US literature finds evidence for both explanations, the non-US literature is more ambiguous. In this paper, we use data from four waves of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), spanning the period 2010–2016, to test whether higher rates of self-employment at older age results from both a lower probability of retirement on the part of the self-employed, as well as transitions into self-employment. We also examine the characteristics of the older self-employed and focus on the role of differences in supplementary pension cover between the employed and self-employed in determining retirement decisions. We find that the higher proportion of self-employed people at older ages in Ireland results from lower retirement rates among the self-employed and not from transitions from employment to self-employment. This is in contrast to the US where transitions into self-employment are more prevalent. We find that the self-employed are older, more likely to be male, and significantly less likely to have any form of supplementary pension cover than the employed. These lower retirement rates and lower degrees of supplementary pension cover suggest that standard approaches to pension provision may be less effective in proving attractive to the self-employed in Ireland.","Pressures on public pension expenditure are partly explained by increases in life expectancy that have surpassed increases in the length of working lives. As a policy solution, extending working lives is potentially beneficial for a number of reasons. At a micro level, income from employment can help individuals to top up other sources of income in older age. There is also some evidence that continuing to work into older age has cognitive benefits (Clouston and Denier, 2017, Rohwedder and Willis, 2010, Emmerson et al., 2004, Mazzonna and Peracchi, 2012). At a macro level, older people make up a large and increasing share of the population and thus their labour supply fundamentally affects the productivity of a country (Chandler and Tetlow, 2014a, Ramnath et al., 2017), as well as contributes to the tax base.====In Europe and the US, the share of the older population in employment has been increasing in recent decades, although labour force participation in older age among men has not yet returned to the levels observed in the 1950s and 1960s (Chandler and Tetlow, 2014b, Maestas and Zissimopoulos, 2010). In Ireland, employment rates among older men and women have been increasing steadily over the last few decades (see Fig. 1). For example, among men aged 55–64, employment rates increased from 59.3 per cent in 1996 to 65.7 per cent in 2016 (although the rates are not yet back at the level observed prior to the recession). The trends among women are even more striking, with the employment rate among women aged 55–64 increasing from just 21 per cent in 1996 to nearly 50 per cent in 2016, with no reduction during the recession. Employment rates among 55–64 year old men in Ireland are slightly higher than the EU-28 average and about average for women.====A feature of employment at older ages that has been observed in many countries is the higher share of older age employment that is accounted for by self-employment (Zissimopoulos and Karoly, 2007, von Bonsdorff et al., 2017, Wahrendorf et al., 2016, Halvorsen and Morrow-Howell, 2017). Employment at older ages in Ireland displays the same pattern. In Ireland in 2010, 18.3 per cent of men aged 50+ and 3.8 per cent of women aged 50+ described their current employment situation as self-employed.==== Compared with those in younger age groups, a higher proportion of older individuals are self-employed; for example, 37.4 per cent of men aged 50–64 in employment in 2010 were self-employed, rising to 70.3 per cent among those aged 75+ years (see Fig. 2). A particular feature of this cohort is the high proportion of older self-employed men in Ireland that are farmers (over one-third) (see also Section 4).====This pattern of rising self-employment rates at the end of the labour market career may reflect higher rates of retirement out of employment compared to self-employment, as well as transitions into self-employment at older ages (Zissimopoulos and Karoly, 2007). One of the earliest US studies found that the increased prevalence of self-employment among older American men was due to shifts from wage-and-salary work into self-employment as well as a higher propensity to retire among wage-and-salary workers compared with the self-employed (Fuchs, 1982). Research by Karoly and Zissimopoulos (2004) for the US reveals that nearly one third of workers aged 51 and above who are self-employed made the transition to self-employment after the age of 50. Self-employment has thus been observed as being an alternative pathway to retirement, and also as a mechanism for facilitating more flexible forms of work in older age (von Bonsdorff et al., 2017, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, 2016). In contrast, Bell and Rutherford (2013), surveying the international evidence, suggest that the size of the flow of older workers from self-employment to employment is of a similar magnitude to the flow of older workers from employment to self-employment, at least in the UK. Banks (2016) finds that transitions from self-employment to employment are more common than transitions from employment to self-employment in England.====From a pension policy perspective, self-employment at older ages may have a range of implications so it is important to have a clearer understanding of who the self-employed are and whether they have always been self-employed or have transitioned into self-employment from being employees. For example, if most of the self-employed have been employees previously, they may have built up pension entitlements in previous jobs thereby lessening concerns about any lack of pension cover in their current positions. On the other hand, entry into self-employment may require investment capital, potentially placing current or future retirement assets at risk (Zissimopoulos and Karoly, 2007).====In this paper, we use data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a nationally-representative study of the population aged 50+ in Ireland, to contribute to this growing literature on self-employment at older ages. A key concern here is the role that financial incentives, primarily supplementary pension cover, play in employment decisions at older ages. Inadequate financial provision for retirement may ‘force’ the self-employed to delay retirement and/or encourage movements into self-employment among the previously employed or retired. We examine a number of research questions:====We find that the self-employed are older, more likely to be male, and significantly less likely to have any form of supplementary pension cover than the employed. We also find that the higher proportion of self-employed people at older ages in Ireland results from lower retirement rates among the self-employed. In contrast to evidence from other countries, principally the US, we do not find evidence of substantial movements into self-employment at older age in Ireland. Moving on to consider transitions in employment status at older age in Ireland, and focusing on the determinants of transitions into retirement, we find that the self-employed are less likely to retire than the employed, even accounting for differential rates of supplementary pension cover between the two groups. These results suggest that there are other (unobserved) factors such as attitudes towards work, risk preferences, ====. that determine later retirement among the self-employed in Ireland.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the institutional context with regard to retirement and pensions in Ireland. Section 3 provides an overview of previous literature on self-employment at older ages. Section 4 describes the data and methods used in this paper.

Rapid economic growth has lifted hundreds of millions of people in China out of poverty, hence helped close the global gap of inequality among countries (Firebaugh and Goesling, 2004, Hung and Kucinskas, 2011). Yet, within China, economic growth and policy changes have also led China to shift from one of the most equal societies in terms of Gini coefficient to one of the most unequal. The most recent official Chinese source reports an income Gini coefficient of 0.465 in 2016, a level that is not only higher than OECD countries, but also increases at the fastest pace among emerging economies (OECD, 2012, Whyte, 2014, Xie and Zhou, 2014).====If the earlier decades of China’s post-socialist era, in the 1980s and 1990s, were featured by economic take-off at the cost of equity, China since the start of the twenty-first century shifted to a different direction, with more attention paid to social and political costs of the fast-growing economic inequality (Duckett and Wang, 2017, Gao et al., 2013, Gao, 2017, Shen et al., 2018). The Chinese government has reasserted its control over the key components of the economy in the last twenty years, from retaining substantial ownership in capital-intensive sectors to maintaining control over strategic assets such as land and natural resources (Naughton, 2017). A majority of the largest Chinese Fortune Global 500 companies are now either state owned or state controlled.====Such an economic development model has enabled the government to reap the benefits of growth and to generate large revenue streams. As shown in Fig. 1, over the past two decades, Chinese government’s revenue as the share of GDP increased from 11.6 percent in 1998 to 28.7 percent by 2018. As a result, the Chinese government not only has the intention but also the fiscal capacity to increase social welfare spending and to build a post-socialist welfare regime. Developing a new social welfare regime is not only a political necessity, as rising income and wealth inequality could challenge the government’s political legitimacy, but also a demographic imperative, as China starts to face accelerating population aging, due to its rapid fertility decline beginning in the early 1970s (Wang, 2011, Cai et al., 2018). As also shown in Fig. 1, China’s total government expenditure as the share of GDP, increased from 12.6 percent in 1998 to 32.8 percent in 2018. A large part of growth in the government expenditure was in the expansion of social welfare programs.====Despite the great efforts in revamping and rebuilding a social welfare system in recent decades, the redistributive effects of social welfare programs remain largely underexplored. Studies based on household survey data in the early 2010s reported a rather limited role of public transfers in closing the inequality gap (Cai and Yue, 2016, Li, 2016). Our previous study (Shen et al., 2018) revealed that as recent as in 2010 China’s public spending disproportionally favored the rich as well as the old. Individuals from the top income quartile benefited more from public transfers in education, health care, and pension, with a ratio of 4 to 1 in comparison to those at the bottom income quartile. The largest source of inequality was found at advanced ages, where the ratio of receiving public pension transfers between the top and the bottom income quartiles was over 50–1. In addition, regardless of income groups, total public transfers received per person aged 65 and older was almost twice the spending per child below age 20. That study also concluded that such a tilted distribution in 2010 was an outcome of both legacies of past social inequalities and the fragmented program design.====In this study, we follow up with an examination of inequalities in public transfers across income and age groups in 2014, and compare the new results with those four years earlier, in 2010. Due to the rapid pace of China’s economic development and expansion of its welfare program, we expect some major difference to emerge in this short 4 year period. We trace changes in the redistributive effects of China’s expanded public transfers by focusing on two dimensions of inequalities: inequalities across generations and across income groups. The two central questions we attempt to answer are first, which age groups and income groups have benefited more from the recent expansion in public transfers during 2010 and 2014 in China? And second, whether and to what extent have the expanded public transfers helped reduce the overall economic inequalities. In the next section we first briefly summarize the development of China’s social welfare regime and demographic challenges. This section is followed by an introduction to the methodology and data sources employed in this study. We then present in the fourth section of the paper our analytical results, and conclude and discuss the policy implications of this study in the last section.",Expansion of public transfers in China: Who are the beneficiaries?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300604,26 February 2019,2019,Research Article,143.0

In these regions, ageing may lead to a widening gap between the demand for health care and its supply, a situation potentially warranting policy intervention (Advisory Council, 2014). Similar concerns have been raised in other countries, e.g. in the US (Cooper et al., 2002, Colwill et al., 2008).====The question under what conditions and in which geographical context the health care needs of an ageing population can be adequately covered adds a new dimension to a long-standing debate on regional imbalances in the distribution of physicians.==== In Germany, this debate has seen a turn of the tide during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Set against the general view of ubiquitous over-supply, at least in western Germany, concerns have been increasing over the last decade about physician shortages in rural regions, most notably but not exclusively in eastern Germany. While in the time span 1995–2009, the total number of office-based physicians has continued to increase by some 27 percent, there has been considerable geographical variation in this trend with a large number of regions losing physicians. At the same time, the number of general practitioners (GPs) has been falling by some 7 percent on average, the decline being much more pronounced in rural regions, where GPs are often the sole providers of medical services. Indeed, the concern about an increasingly unequal geographical distribution in the access to primary health care and about the ensuing health outcomes such as avoidable cancer deaths (Sundmacher and Busse, 2011) or avoidable hospitalizations (Sundmacher and Kopetsch, 2015) has been at the heart of recent health care reforms (Ozegowski and Sundmacher, 2012, Ozegowski and Sundmacher, 2014; Advisory Council, 2014). Ono et al. (2014) summarize similar policy concerns for a number of OECD countries.====It is the aim of this study to identify some of the relationships underlying the development of the geographic distribution of physicians and, in particular, to understand the role of regional population change. We construct an overlapping-generations model in which physicians commit to a practice location when young and then provide services to the local population over their working lives. Determining within entry equilibrium the number of physicians per capita within a region, we show how the regional supply of physicians depends on the stream of current and anticipated practice income and, thus, how it depends on the current and future demographic make-up, as measured by the age structure and size of the population. From the entry equilibrium condition we then derive a structural equation, allowing us to formulate and test in a theory-grounded way a number of hypotheses about the determinants of physician supply at the regional level. Our analysis points at three particularly relevant issues when it comes to assessing the impact on physician supply of regional population change. Each of these suggests that the view that regions with large elderly populations are attractive for physicians may be too simplistic.====First, the profitability of offering services to different age groups of the population does not only vary with the demand by these groups but also with the profit margin earned on each patient. If reimbursement rates are only imperfectly adjusted to differences in treatment costs and if the treatment of older patients is more costly, then it is no longer clear that a larger share of elderly patients automatically raises profit. Hence, the design of the reimbursement system is bound to matter. Furthermore, it is likely that the sensitivity of treatment costs and demand with respect to age varies systematically with the regional circumstances. For instance, long travelling distances and poor availability of public transport within rural as opposed to urban settings may render the treatment of elderly and frail patients more costly, both as more home visits are required and as rendering such visits is more costly for the physician. Thus, we expect the relative profitability of different age groups to vary with the position of a region on the urban–rural spectrum as well as with the extent to which the reimbursement system is accounting for such variation.====Second, as physicians typically set up their location for a long period – in many instances for the remainder of their working lives – their location choice should not only reflect current but also future profit opportunities. With expectations about the future demand for services being linked to population change, regions that experience population growth may attract physicians in excess of the number that would be supported by the current size of the population. Conversely, in regions with a shrinking population the number of physicians may fall short of the number that would be supported by the current population.====Third, the extent to which the future income stream bears on the current supply of physicians depends on how far the process of exit and entry leads to an adjustment in the number of physicians towards its equilibrium value. We show that under instantaneous adjustment to equilibrium, the number of physicians per capita is determined exclusively by current income, whereas future demographic development does not bear on the current supply of physicians. This is because changes in income are fully offset by compensating changes in the number of rivalling physicians. Thus, regardless of the future size and profitability of the regional market, a physician’s remaining life-cycle income corresponds to the (reservation) value that is necessary for physicians to locate within that region. In contrast, if the local supply of physicians does not fully adjust towards its equilibrium value, then the current number of physicians per capita depends on future demand and income as long as the market is expected to be out of equilibrium. Reasons for a lack of adjustment towards equilibrium may be regulatory entry restrictions and the presence of sunk costs, leading to entry and exit barriers, respectively. Given the presence of entry regulation at regional level in Germany, we seek to establish empirically whether or not this leads to a substantive lack in equilibrium adjustment in local physician markets.====We use panel data for Germany at the regional level to examine empirically the relationship between local physician supply and its demographic and geographic determinants. Using annual data for 409 districts for the period 1995–2009, we analyze how the population share of individuals aged 60 and above (60plus) and the share of individuals aged 19 and below (19minus) affect the local supply of physicians. In our estimations, we focus on GPs as a large and homogeneous sub-group of office-based physicians, with at least some GPs operating in all regions. Moreover, GPs typically provide services to a local population, implying that inter-regional patient flows are of little relevance. We control for regional characteristics which, according to the literature, are relevant for the geographical distribution of physician practices.====Using a fixed-effects panel data estimator, we analyze how the number of GPs per capita depends on the age structure and growth of the population as well as on the presence of regulatory entry ceilings. Our results show that the impact of the age structure on the supply of physicians depends on whether or not a region is urban. Most prominently, the share of the population 60plus has a positive impact on GP supply within metropolitan areas but a negative impact within rural areas. Expectations about future demography, as measured by the growth rate of the list size, i.e. the number of residents served by each physician within the region, in the year subsequent to the current year of observation, have an economically small impact on the current number of GPs per capita. While this hints at some imperfections in equilibrium adjustment in general, we also show that these effects are stronger in regions for which an “excess supply” has been established and which are therefore likely to be subject to entry ceilings. We also find confirming evidence for the notion that greater population density (across space) tends to induce stronger competition, leading ceteris paribus to a lower number of GPs per capita (Gravelle, 1999, Nuscheler, 2003), as well as for the substitute relationship between GPs and internists (Newhouse et al., 1982).====Based on our estimations, we employ a decomposition analysis to study the drivers behind the decline in the supply of GPs in Germany over the period 1997–2008. We find that population ageing itself would have supported an increase in supply in both urban and rural regions. In rural regions, this effect is enhanced further by the reduction in population density, leading to a decline in competition. While these impacts are dampened by a concomitant increase in the supply of internists, we find that overall the decline in the number of GPs per capita can only be explained by an increase in their reservation income. This speaks to a (relative) decline in the attractiveness of working in general practice, especially in rural regions.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section surveys the related literature, while Section 3 offers a brief introduction into the institutional (Section 3.1) and demographic (Section 3.2) context of the provision of GP services in Germany over the time frame 1995–2009. In Section 4.1 we then develop and solve a theoretical model of regional physician supply, which we employ in Section 4.2 to derive the structural equation and hypotheses. Section 5 presents the empirical analysis, including a description of the data in Section 5.1, our main regression analysis based on different specifications in 5.2 Demographic and geographic determinants of GP supply: Estimation and results, 5.3 Accounting for entry regulation, and a decomposition of the change in GP supply based on our empirical findings in Section 5.4. Conclusions are offered in Section 6.

We show this trend by computing a health deficit index for a panel of 14 European Countries and six waves of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We find that for each year of later birth, health deficits decline by on average 1.4–1.5 percent with insignificant differences between men and women, between countries, and over time. We argue that this trend approximates the rate of medical progress, broadly defined. The steady progress implies substantial delays of human aging. For example, the level of health deficits experienced at age 65 by individuals born 1920 is predicted to be experienced at age 85 by individuals born 1945. The potential health gains are not fully appropriated by individuals of low socio-economic status. Their health deficits decline at about the same rate but from a higher level, which means that we find long-run persistence of health ====.","As humans get older they develop more health deficits, i.e. they age also in physiological terms. Like mortality, physiological aging can be conceptualized as being stochastic at the individual level while it exhibits strong regularities at the population level (Arking, 2006). On average, humans develop 2–4 percent more health deficits from one birthday to the next (Mitnitski et al., 2002a, Abeliansky and Strulik, 2018a, Abeliansky and Strulik, 2018b, Abeliansky and Strulik, 2018c). The aging process, however, is modifiable. It can be postponed by healthy behavior and medical technology. In this paper we show a steady decline of health deficits prevalent in elderly individuals at any given age. For every year of later birth, younger generations experience 1.4–1.5 percent less health deficits than earlier born generations. This trend is remarkably stable across 14 European countries and over time (i.e.==== ====over the range of our sample from birth year 1918 to birth year 1965).====An earlier literature has observed similar long-run trends for mortality. Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) show that best-practice life expectancy increased by 3 months per year of birth since 1840, with country trends converging to best practice trend. From this observation they conclude “broken limits to life expectancy”. White (2002) shows a similar linear trend in life expectancy for 21 high-income countries. Strulik and Vollmer (2013) show for a sample of developed countries that since the mid 20th century human lifespan increased in sync with life-expectancy.==== Vaupel (2010) concludes that human senescence has been delayed by a decade in the sense that levels of mortality that used to prevail at age 70 now prevail at age 80, and levels that used to prevail at age 80 now prevail at age 90.====It is not self-evident that declining mortality is associated with, on average, better health. If people were increasingly saved from death without curing or postponing the respective diseases, the prevalence of health deficits would increase. Several studies compiled evidence for increasing prevalence of aging-related (chronic) diseases at the population level (e.g.==== ====Crimmins, 2004, Christensen et al., 2009). These trends, however, could be mostly composition effects resulting from an increasing average age of the population. They are compatible with improving health at the individual level, i.e.==== ====improving health at ====. This notion is supported by several studies using aggregated (macro) data. Crimmins et al. (2016) find that disability-free life expectancy in the U.S.==== ====increased since the 1980s. Salomon et al. (2012) show that healthy life expectancy increases in sync with life expectancy (see also Strulik and Werner, 2016). Chatterji et al. (2015) show declining trends of functioning and disability status (using, among other sources, the SHARE data set). Dalgaard et al. (2018) construct aggregate health deficit indices for the working-age population of 191 countries and show that, over the last quarter of century, the workforce did not age in physiological terms, although it got chronologically older. We contribute to this literature by showing a robust and precisely estimated trend at which the health status of humans improves such that later born cohorts display, at the same age, less health deficits than earlier born cohorts.====The measurement of health and aging by the health deficit index has been introduced by Mitnitski et al., 2001, Mitnitski et al., 2002a, Mitnitski et al., 2002b. It is now a well established methodology applied in countless studies in the medical science and, recently, also in the economics of aging (Dalgaard and Strulik, 2014).==== The index simply records the fraction of a large set of aging-related health conditions that is present in an individual (see Searle et al., 2008, for methodological background). The health deficit index and, in particular its exponential increase with age (akin to the Gompertz law of mortality) has a micro-foundation in the reliability theory of human aging (Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 1991). It is also supported more directly by a network theory of aging (Mitnitski et al., 2017).====We compute the health deficit index for individuals from 14 countries and 6 waves (collected 2004 – 2015) of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We built on our earlier work (Abeliansky and Strulik, 2018a, Abeliansky and Strulik, 2018b, Abeliansky and Strulik, 2018c) and exploit the panel and cohort structure of the SHARE data. In previous studies we controlled for year-of-birth fixed effects but here we make them the explicit object of investigation and show the presence of long-run trends of health improvements and their unequal appropriation by individuals from different socioeconomic background.====The steady pace at which health deficits decline from one birth cohort to the next as well as its similarity across countries suggests to associate it with medical progress. To paraphrase Chernew and Newhouse (2011), continuous change is hard to explain with discretionary and irregular changes like policy interventions. Chernew and Newhouse (2011) apply this reasoning to argue that the observed secular growth of health care spending is likely driven by income growth and medical progress. This view is largely accepted in the literature, albeit with disagreement of how much technological progress contributes to health expenditure trends (Chernew and Newhouse, 2011).====In our case, considering the reverse causality, income growth and health expenditure growth are a priori also conceivable drivers of health trends. It seems, however, unlikely that large parts of the secular decline in health deficits are driven by growth of income or health expenditure. The reason is that growth of GDP per capita and growth of health care spending vary greatly across the countries of our sample. For example, for 21 OECD countries from Chandra and Skinner (2012, Table 1), average annual GDP capita growth in the period 1980–2006 ranged from 1.0 percent (Switzerland) to 3.8 percent (Ireland). Health expenditure growth ranged from 1.6 percent (Sweden) to 4.5 percent (Spain). The total increase of the health expenditure share of GDP during this period ranged from 0.5 to 7 percentage points with a mean of 2.9 and a standard deviation of 1.5.==== There is thus a huge variation across countries along these dimensions whereas there is very little variation across countries in the rate at which health deficit decline. We estimate that this rate is not statistically different across countries and that it lies with 95% confidence in the interval ==== for women and ==== for men. This means that there is little variation left to be explained by the large country differences in income growth and health expenditure growth. Medical progress, broadly defined (including, for example, knowledge about healthy behavior) can be more easily imagined to diffuse across countries and to be the common driving force behind the steady decline of health deficits.====The trend rate of health deficit decline represents an output- or success-oriented measure of medical progress. It provides an alternative to input-oriented measures that interpret technological change as the time-trend of the unexplained part of health expenditure, akin to the Solow-residual in studies of productivity growth (Chernew and Newhouse, 2011). A particularly interesting study in this regard is Smith et al. (2009) who interpret medical technology as the common year-fixed-effects in health expenditure regressions for a panel of 21 OECD countries. The estimates suggests that medical technology increased relatively steadily since the 1980s, at annual rates around 1.2–1.5 percent (Smith et al., 2009, Exhibit 2).====The benefits of medical progress, however, are not appropriated equally by everyone. We use information on years of education to approximate own socio-economic status and on books at home in childhood (at age 10) to approximate socio-economic family background. We find that lower socio-economic strata experience a similar (yet not exactly equal) rate at which health deficits decline by year of birth but that there are large differences in levels at each year of birth. This means that low socioeconomic status delays the full appropriation of medical progress. For example, at age 75, individuals born in 1945 who obtained 6 years of education display the same health deficit index as individuals born in 1910 with 15 years of education. This delay is about same for both men and women.====We also find differential effects for socioeconomic background. Individuals from families of higher socioeconomic status (more books at home at age 10) exhibit less health deficits at any age. The effect of socioeconomic background is particularly strong for women. For example, at age 75, women born in 1930 with no books at home display the same health status as women born in 1920 with a bookcase of books at home, i.e.==== ====they experience a delay in the appropriation of technical progress of about 10 years. For men this difference is just about 2 years.====As mentioned above, we find only a very small time trend for health inequality. Moreover, the direction of the trend depends on whether inequality is measured in absolute or relative terms. In terms of health deficits displayed at a given age, the distance between high and low socioeconomic status declines somewhat over time. In relative terms, in contrast, there is mild divergence. At any age, the ratio of health deficits displayed by individuals of low vs.==== ====high socioeconomic status, is mildly higher for later born cohorts. These differences, however, are quantitatively small such that, as a stylized fact, health inequality remains almost constant in the long run.====The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we describe the data. In Section 3 we estimate the model of human aging and compare long-run trends identified by year-of-birth fixed effects and year-of-birth time trends. In Section 4 we investigate the role of socio-economic status and background.

However, empirical evidence shows that the labor supply and related fiscal effects of more flexibility in the pension system, through partial retirement, are ambiguous and strongly depend on the design of partial retirement regimes. Two margins are in particular important: (1) the entry age into partial retirement programs; and (2) the timing of pension benefits in partial retirement prior to full retirement. Based on administrative data from Germany this paper analyzes how variations in these two margins affect labor supply and fiscal balances. For the empirical analysis we use a dynamic structural retirement model. Our results show that partial retirement can lead to positive ==== (an increase of up to 3.4% in employment volume) if the partial retirement entry age is equal to the early retirement age. A partial retirement scheme that combines earnings from part-time employment with partial pensions and an entry age that is equal to the early retirement age yields positive financial effects for both individuals and institutions. Thus, reducing the access constraints to partial retirement from the early retirement age onwards can be an important policy to meet the challenges of demographic change.","The demographic change challenges pension insurance systems around the world. In particular, the aging of the population increases the group of pension recipients relative to the number of contributors. Therefore, most OECD countries have reversed their retirement policies since the 1990s, introducing pension reforms to encourage longer working lives and to alleviate the decline of the working age population. Reforms include tighter qualifying conditions and increases in the early retirement age (ERA), the introduction of actuarial deductions for early retirement, increases in the normal retirement age (NRA) – i.e. the age at which people first receive full benefits without actuarial deductions==== – or a combination of these policies. In addition, policies aim to incentivize later retirement entry by enabling more flexible transitions into retirement through partial retirement or flexible retirement rules. Generally, partial retirement schemes allow for a gradual reduction of work hours in the last years before entering full retirement. Further, partial retirement may include flexible combinations of part-time labor earnings and partial pension receipt. While some partial retirement schemes include incentives to work at reduced working hours beyond the normal retirement age, this paper focuses on the labor supply and fiscal effects of partial retirement before the normal retirement age. Several countries have already introduced partial retirement programs into their public pension systems (Eurofound, 2016) and other countries, including Germany, are in the process of making retirement more flexible.====The labor supply effects and the related fiscal effects of more flexibility in the pension system through partial retirement are ambiguous. On the one hand, partial retirement provides incentives to remain in the labor force for individuals who otherwise might exit employment via either early retirement or unemployment. On the other hand, partial retirement can also decrease labor supply if full-time working individuals who otherwise would work until the normal retirement age enter partial retirement, thus reducing their working hours. The sign and the size of labor supply effects strongly depend on the design of partial retirement regimes. Two margins are particularly important: (1) the entry age into partial retirement programs; and (2) the timing of pension benefit payments. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing how variations in these two margins affect labor supply and fiscal balances.====For our analysis, we use a dynamic structural retirement model developed in Tolan (2017) that incorporates the option for partial retirement. In the model, individuals maximize the present discounted utility of consumption and leisure by making annual decisions between continuing to work in a full-time position or leaving employment through one of three potential retirement paths: regular retirement, partial retirement, and retirement through unemployment. Individuals face uncertainty about mortality risk and labor market frictions through involuntary job loss. Moreover, the model includes a detailed description of the relevant aspects of the tax and transfer system and of the pension rules. Using the estimated parameters from the model, we are able to perform counterfactual policy simulations, in which we vary the entry age of partial retirement and the timing of pension benefits. We analyze the implications of partial retirement in the context of the German pension system. For the estimation, we use high quality administrative data, the Biographical Data of Social Insurance Agencies in Germany (BASiD), which provides information on full employment histories, earnings, and pension accrual on the individual level. In the empirical analysis we focus on West German men.====Our results show that partial retirement can lead to positive labor supply effects. In more detail, we find that compared to a regime without partial retirement, partial retirement increases the employment volume measured as a share in full-time equivalent (FTE) employment the most (by about 3.4%) when the entry age to partial retirement is equal to the ERA (i.e. at age 63). In addition, partial retirement yields positive fiscal effects but there is a crucial difference in the way these effects are generated depending on the partial retirement entry age. At entry ages before the ERA (i.e. 60–62), the fiscal surplus is mostly gained through actuarial deductions to individual pensions, while pension payments practically do not change when the entry age is equal to the ERA. In the latter case the positive fiscal effects result from higher tax payments and social security contributions, which are achieved through the increased labor supply rates. While the timing of pension payments does not noticeably affect labor supply behavior, it matters for the fiscal consequences. A scenario that pays 50% of pension benefits during partial retirement with a partial retirement entry age equal to the ERA generates a fiscal gain of about 5,700€per person that is mainly related to higher tax payments and higher social security contributions. Compared to this, regimes that pay out more pensions during the partial retirement phase yield higher positive fiscal gains but also negatively affect individual pension payments in full retirement due the higher share of pension benefits subjects to actuarial deductions. This increases the risk for individuals with low income to become dependent on social assistance in old age.====Existing empirical evidence about the labor supply effects of partial retirement is mixed. This heterogeneity is partly related to the specific context of the studies and the analyzed pension reforms. For instance, two cross European studies (Aranki and Macchiarelli, 2013, Been and van Vliet, 2014) find positive effects of partial retirement due to postponed retirement and even increased total working hours among men. Similarly, Wadensjö (2006) finds that the Swedish national partial retirement scheme increases overall labor supply because the potentially earlier exiters who move to partial retirement outweigh the number of potential full-time employees who move to partial retirement. Other studies on partial retirement in Nordic countries, Ilmakunnas and Ilmakunnas (2006) for Finland and Hermansen (2015) for Norway, find no effect of partial retirement, neither on the probability of thinking about continuing working after the age of 63 nor on the probability that a 61- or 62-year-old withdraws from the labor market with an early pension in the next two years of their employment. In contrast, Graf et al. (2011) find a negative impact of the Austrian partial retirement scheme despite an increase in working life duration. Machado and Portela (2012) conclude that the negative labor supply effects of part-time work among elderly in Portugal means that partial retirement could be interpreted as a signal for a higher preference for early retirement and, similarly, Albanese et al. (2016) find overall negative effects of the Belgian partial retirement scheme on total labor supply. For the Netherlands, Elsayed et al. (2015) find in a stated preference analysis that partial retirement would extend working lives by about one year but still reduces the total employment volume of the elderly. For Germany, Berg et al., 2015, Huber et al., 2016 evaluate the labor supply effect of a specific partial retirement scheme that was implemented in 1996. While both studies find a positive effect of partial retirement on the extension of working lives, Huber et al. (2016) find positive effects on total employment volume for only East Germany but not for West Germany.====Our analysis differs from the mentioned evaluations of specific partial retirement regimes. Instead our evaluation is closely linked to studies that use structural retirement models. (e.g. Rust, 1989, Stock and Wise, 1990, Rust and Phelan, 1997, Benitez-Silva, 2000, French, 2005, Van der Klaauw and Wolpin, 2008, Haan and Prowse, 2014). The studies by Gustman and Steinmeier, 2008, Tolan, 2017 are particularly relevant for our analysis: these studies explicitly model partial retirement and simulate the labor supply effects of partial retirement schemes. We extend these studies and provide evidence on how the design of a partial retirement program, specifically the entry age and the timing of pension benefits, affect labor supply and fiscal balances.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide an overview about the structural retirement model, the institutions and the data. Then, in Section 3, we perform policy simulations to analyze the labor supply and fiscal effects of partial retirement and show how these effects depend on the entry age into partial retirement and the timing of pension benefit payments.

As frailty is a common but complex phenomenon in the oldest-old, cost-effective strategies for its management are needed.","The worldwide phenomenon of demographic change will strongly affect the composition of the German population. According to the 13th population projection published by the German Federal Statistical Office in 2015, the share of German citizens older than 65 years will rise from 21% in 2013 to 33% in 2060 (Federal Statistical Office, 2015). Of particular interest is the fact that the share of people aged 80 years or older, i.e. the oldest old, will more than double, from 5.4% in 2013 to 13% in 2060. The oldest old have a high risk of suffering from health conditions leading to the utilization of health care services. For example, the prevalence of dementia, which increases extremely with increasing age (Lucca, 2015), and the degree of frailty (Mitnitski, 2002) are rather high.====Studies focussing exclusively on health care utilization by the oldest old have seldom been conducted, and little is known about factors that are associated with health care costs in this group. To address this lack of evidence, we employed Anderseńs behavioural model of health care utilization (Andersen and Newman, 1973) to identify factors associated with health care costs in the population of oldest olds (≥85 years) in Germany. Andersen and Newman, the creators of this model, developed a framework of predisposing factors (describing the individual’s predisposition to utilize health care services), enabling factors (factors that facilitate or prevent the utilization of health care services) and need factors (factors that require the utilization of health care services). The Andersen model has been used frequently in the elicitation of determinants of health care costs for various diseases (Lo, 2016, Alonzo et al., 2016, Kristin and Klock Stein, 2018, van der Aa, 2015, McClure, 2017).====To our best knowledge, there has been only one former study which analysed health care costs in a comparable highly-aged sample (Hazra and Rudisill, 2017). This study from the UK was based on electronic health records and laid a special emphasis on the last year of life. The authors found elevated health care costs and identified morbidity and impairment as important cost drivers. In our study, we used primary data collected by interviews, did not restrict the sample to those in the last year of life, analysed more and different subcategories of costs, especially in the nursing and supportive care sector, and considered several explanatory variables not documented in routine data.",Determinants of health-care costs in the oldest-old in Germany,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18301282,15 May 2019,2019,Research Article,147.0

Accompanying this transition is an important change in the age structure of the population whereby the percentage of working age citizens increases. This increase in the share of the working age population is referred to the “demographic bonus” or “demographic dividend” as it has the potential to raise per capita income simply through an accounting effect associated with having more workers to non-workers in the population, and not because of any direct effect on the productivity of factors.====Several researchers argue, however, that the demographic dividend may extend beyond this pure accounting or translation effect, a so-called second demographic dividend. It is easy to think of several channels whereby demographic variables may have growth effects beyond the translation effect.==== For example, life cycle considerations suggest that an increase in the share of the working age population will lead to an increase in an economy’s savings rates associated with physical capital and human capital accumulation.====Early empirical work in this area examined the importance of demographic variables for the growth of nations without attempting to determine if the demographic dividend extends beyond the accounting effect.==== For example, Bloom and Williamson (1998) looking at the experiences of the East Asian tigers, found that nearly one third of growth in per capita income is attributed to increases in the share of the working age population. For another example, Kelley and Schmidt (2005) reached a similar conclusion in extending the analysis to almost all of Asia.====A second generation of research, however, does try to determine if the demographic dividend extends beyond a pure accounting effect. For example, Cuaresma et al. (2014), using a panel of countries conclude that there is a secondary dividend associated with education. They arrive at this conclusion in three steps. First, they derive a growth rate regression equation from economic theory. Next, they show that the size of the estimated coefficients on the demographic variables in the regression that fails to include lagged education as a control imply an effect larger than the pure translation one. Lastly, they show that this extra effect vanishes once lagged education is added as a control variable. Rentería et al. (2016) arrive at the same conclusion for Mexico and Spain but use a different method, the National Transfer Account (NTA) method.====In this paper, we reexamine the question of whether the demographic dividend extends beyond a pure accounting or translation effect by studying the development experiences of Brazilian micro-regions between 1970 and 2000. Following Cuaresma et al. (2014), we estimate a growth rate equation using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), but extend the analysis in two important ways. First, we break down population growth into its natural rate of increase (NRI) component and its net migration component. Second, we decompose the natural rate of increase into a crude birth rate component and a crude death rate component.====These decompositions may provide new insights on how demographic variables affect development. Although both NRI and net migration have the same effect on population growth, it is easy to think that they could have very different impacts on a region’s growth of per capita income for a number of reasons. For example, the effects of migration and NRI could be different if migrants are more likely to be young and have higher fertility than the native population. These differences in characteristics would affect the demographics of both origin and destination economies.==== Moreover, migration may be driven by low-skilled individuals looking for better opportunities or by the dire need to flee adverse natural conditions. Alternatively, it may be driven by demand for high-skilled workers by firms in richer areas (brain drain). Depending on the balance of these forces, migration may have a significant effect on the quality of labor force. Although the literature on the demographic dividend seems to neglect these effects – possibly on account that migration is inconsequential at the national level –, we believe they may be important in the context of regional economies where migration accounts for a higher share of population growth.====Similarly, by breaking down the natural rate into a crude birth rate component and a crude death rate component, new insights can be potentially gained. Given the quality versus quantity trade off, it is natural to think that the crude birth rate may have a greater effect beyond the pure translation effect. Moreover, although the mechanical effect of the crude death rate should be opposite in sign to that of the crude birth rate, improvements in health have the potential to increase economic growth.==== Therefore, each of these components of the NRI can possibly induce growth effects beyond the translation effect of different magnitudes.====Our analysis both confirms the findings of others and offers some new insights into how demographic variables affect development. Like Cuaresma et al. (2014), we find evidence of both a first demographic dividend and a second demographic dividend, with the latter being associated with education. Quantitatively, the effect of the first dividend is small; in a counterfactual experiment based on our estimation results, we show that the translation effect accounts for no more than 10 percent of the income gap between the richest and poorest regions in Brazil. The second dividend, namely, the changes in age structure that are correlated with the accumulation of human capital, is crucial for explaining the disparities in regional development in Brazil. Furthermore, we show that the negative effect of population growth – and more importantly, fertility – disappears after controlling for education, suggesting important behavioral changes accompanying the demographic transition. In particular, it suggests that the long-run Beckerian trade-off between child quantity (fertility) and child quality (education) is at the heart of some portion of the second demographic dividend in its fertility decline component.====There are a number of virtues to reexamining the question of whether the demographic dividend extends beyond a pure accounting effect using regional data rather than international data. First, as institutions and exogenous shocks, which are clearly important for economic growth, are more homogeneous across regions within a country than across countries, biases that arise from the omission of variables are less likely. Second, as there is far more consistency in the collection of data and definition of variables inside a nation, measurement error is less of a concern.====Despite these advantages, there are very few papers that examine the importance of demographic variables for economic growth using subnational data and that take an econometric approach. Indeed, a contribution of this paper is to fill a gap in the regional development literature that has for the most part neglected the potential importance of the demographic transition for economic growth. One exception is Wei and Hao (2010) who show that fertility has a positive effect on economic growth in Chinese provinces.==== Our paper is also innovative in that it is the first to take an econometric approach to test for the presence of a demographic dividend in Latin American countries. All the other tests on the demographic dividend in Latin American countries are based on the NTA method.====Of course, at the subnational level, there is the issue of whether there is sufficient heterogeneity across regional units to validate the analysis. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 speak to this point. Fig. 1 shows the national statistics for a number of relevant demographic variables whereas Fig. 2 shows a subset of these statistics for Brazil’s five macro regions. Starting with the national statistics shown in Fig. 1, Brazil experienced a demographic transition in the post-World War II period typical of middle-income developing countries, and is currently at the latter stages of this transition. As measured on the right-hand axis, population growth rates have declined and are now converging to replacement rates. The demographic dividend, measured by the share of the working-age population in the total population and measured on the left-hand vertical axis, has risen steadily since 1965 and is expected to peak at around 70% sometime between 2020 and 2025. Turning to Brazil’s five macro regions shown in Fig. 2, we observe large differences in the timing of the demographic transition. Although all regions are characterized by declining population growth rates (Panel a), these rates were far lower in the Northeast, Southeast and South than in the North and Central-West in all years of the period. Turning to Panel b, which shows the working age share of the population, the Southeast, South and Central-West display a steady increase since the 1970s. In contrast, the North and Northeast, which start with lower shares, experienced a far less steady increase with an acceleration beginning around 1980. As we shall subsequently document, these differences are more striking at the micro-region level, making Brazil an excellent laboratory for testing the demographic dividend hypothesis.====This paper is divided into five sections. Following this introduction, Section 2 briefly describes the theoretical model that underlies the regression analysis as well as the derivation of the key regression equations. Section 3 describes the data sources and definitions of micro-regions, and then presents summary statistics of the variables used in the regression analysis. Section 4 describes the empirical strategy and reports the results of the regression analysis.

This paper uses the recently developed National Transfer Accounts (NTA) methodology that enables comprehensive measurement of (1) public and (2) private intergenerational transfers (the ones that go through monetary transactions and those that result from the family provision of welfare in terms of unpaid work), as well as (3) asset-based reallocations resulting from interaction with capital and financial markets. Moreover, we take into account all age groups and the gender dimension as well. Our analysis provides comparable NTA results for 10 EU countries from 2010 and links welfare regimes and inter-age reallocation systems. The paper contributes mainly to the existing welfare regimes’ literature by incorporating several dimensions of welfare domains, also those usually criticized as not being included in the Esping-Andersen’s (1990) initial typology of welfare regimes (for example, by including care responsibilities provided by both genders). Based on five indicators, we show a clear connection between welfare regimes and inter-age reallocation systems and classify countries into three different groups: social-democratic (Hungary, Slovenia, and Sweden), conservative (Austria, Finland, France, Italy, and Spain), and liberal (Germany and the United Kingdom). Germany is the main exception; based on inter-age reallocation results, it is not characterized as a prototypical conservative welfare state, but rather as a liberal welfare state.","The generational contract is the most important and continuous dimension of contemporary welfare systems. Much of the recent debate related to the generational contract focuses on the public dimension only (as also stated in Albertini et al., 2007). However, to fully understand the functioning of the welfare systems, the private dimension should be taken into account as well. In the last decade, scholars have recognized the importance of private transfers and their link to the welfare regimes (Attias-Donfut et al., 2005, Brandt and Deindl, 2013, Albertini and Kohli, 2013, Albertini et al., 2007, Mudrazija, 2016, Orloff, 1993). These authors searched for similarities in transfer patterns among European countries and systematically arranged them in order to link the transfer characteristics with a typical categorization of countries into conservative/Continental, social-democratic/Scandinavian/Nordic, and Southern European/Mediterranean welfare regimes.====According to Albertini et al. (2007), financial family transfers are more frequent but less intensive in the Nordic countries than in the Southern European countries. Attias-Donfut et al. (2005) demonstrate that welfare redistribution is, overall, less important in the Southern European countries than in the Nordic countries, therefore families need to provide additional support to the limited public welfare provision. Further, authors argue that there is a clear North–South divide when taking into account either financial family transfers (financial or material gifts or support other than housing and food) (Albertini et al., 2007, Albertini and Kohli, 2013) or non-financial family transfers (e.g., amount of time spent caring for grandchildren) (Brandt and Deindl, 2013). Similarly, by considering the net value of family transfers rather than the absolute value of family transfers, Mudrazija (2016) shows that financial and non-financial family transfers are the largest in Southern Europe and the smallest in the North, while Continental European countries are somewhere in between. The only exception is Germany, according to Mudrazija (2016), that rather belongs to the group of Mediterranean countries than to the group of Continental ones. Moreover, net family support is less pronounced and starts later in adults’ lives in the social-democratic welfare regime countries than in the traditional (i.e., Southern European) ones (Mudrazija, 2014). In summary, three different intergenerational transfer regimes are recognized in Europe, coinciding with the welfare regime typology: the Scandinavian, Continental, and Mediterranean regimes (Albertini and Kohli, 2013).====All these previous studies, however, lack a comprehensive inclusion of both private and public transfers. The majority connect transfer and welfare regimes by focusing mainly on private transfers (e.g., Albertini and Kohli, 2013, Albertini et al., 2007, Attias-Donfut et al., 2005, Mudrazija, 2014). Some studies take into account both public and private transfers (Brandt and Deindl, 2013, Mudrazija, 2016), but they limit their focus only to certain age groups. They use data from the SHARE survey (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe), in which only individuals aged 50 or over were interviewed – making it possible for the researchers to include only transfers ==== and ==== this age group. Even though SHARE data include information about transfers of time and money, by including individuals 50+ only, these analyses omit transfers that flow from younger parents to their children. In addition to excluding the most significant flows of household private transfers (see Gál et al., 2018), analyses based on SHARE exclude representatives of liberal welfare regimes (since no country in the SHARE survey belongs to a liberal welfare regime).====It is difficult to estimate the role of families in welfare provision, because transfers among household members are not reported in the National Accounts and it is hard to measure what is happening behind the household’s walls (Esping-Andersen, 1999). In contrast, the government’s role in welfare provision can be measured easily. To capture the family capacity of the welfare provision and to measure it for all age groups of beneficiaries, private transfers are often measured indirectly, captured via the government’s non-provision of care (Esping-Andersen, 1999). Researchers assume that low government responsibility for residents should lead to extensive family responsibility for them. One highly cited example is Saraceno and Keck’s (2010) empirical research that links the typology of welfare regimes with the exchange in responsibility between the family and the state in EU countries. Their research includes both young and old generations, and measures family responsibility indirectly with indicators such as amount of child allowances, duration of maternity leave, minimum amount of non-contributory pensions, and coverage offered by residential and homecare services. They conclude that country-specific policy profiles do not always coincide for young and old generations. They identify three groups of countries according to their policy profiles: countries with a high degree of de-familialisation (a high level of public support) towards young and old generations (e.g., Sweden and France); countries with a high degree of familialisation (familial support) for young and old generations (e.g., Italy and Spain); and the largest group of countries, which show large differences in the support provided to both age groups (e.g., Germany, the United Kingdom, Austria, and Hungary). Even though Saraceno and Keck (2010) include young and old generations, their research is limited because they measure private transfers only indirectly.====The recently developed National Transfer Accounts (NTA) methodology (Lee and Mason, 2011) enables us to comprehensively quantify and analyse both private and public transfers. We examine whether there is a connection between welfare regimes and inter-age reallocation systems when both private and public transfers are measured comprehensively and all age groups and gender dimension are considered as well. Our paper thus contributes to the theoretical and empirical knowledge on the link between transfers and welfare regimes in European countries. We connect inter-age reallocation systems and welfare regimes by introducing five different indicators derived from NTA results, showing the basic differences in characteristics of the welfare systems in Europe.====First, we discuss Esping-Andersen’s typology of welfare regimes, including its critics, and further extensions. Next, the main characteristics of welfare regimes are presented, followed by classification of analysed countries into specific welfare regimes. In Section ‘Methodology and Data’ we briefly introduce the NTA methodology that serves as the basis of the data and the analysis and present the indicators we develop in order to link inter-age reallocation systems and welfare regimes. We then show the descriptive results and, by focusing on the indicators, we present the degree of importance of the state, markets, and the family in financing the dependent populations in the Results section.

The dependency ratio, defined here as the ratio of the number of individuals aged 65 and older to the number of individuals between 20 and 64 years old, is 48% in 2015 and will rise to 80% by early 2050s and stay at around 80% during the second half of the century.==== Expenditures for age-related social insurance programs such as pensions, public health care and long-term care insurance are projected to rise significantly, far outpacing the projected revenues and insurance premia collected. As a result, the fiscal outlook for Japan is predicted to further deteriorate as researchers and policymakers search for ways to achieve sustained fiscal consolidation.==== ====Japan is already the oldest society in the world having experienced aging earlier and in a more severe fashion than any other economy. However, aging is a widespread phenomenon and it will be useful to demonstrate projected demographics in selected key economies. In particular, Fig. 1 shows life expectancy and fertility in Japan, United States, China, South Korea, and France.====Life expectancy has increased very sharply in Japan after 1950, is highest currently, and projected to remain so through 2070. Total fertility rate in Japan, shown in Fig. 1(b), is significantly lower than those in Unites States and France, although the gap is projected to close over the next few decades. South Korea has even lower fertility rates and will surpass Japan in terms of old age dependency ratio after 2060 as Fig. 2 shows. The total fertility rate in China also declines sharply due to the one-child policy.====The old age dependency ratio is rising in all five economies in Fig. 2 but currently it is highest in Japan and will remain so over the next several decades. The focus of this paper is to explore the fiscal consequences of aging in Japan and the potential success of various policies and outcomes in achieving fiscal sustainability.====Among the outcomes considered in this paper are further gains in female labor force participation and their wages. Fig. 3 shows the FLFP (over 15 years old) and the female wage gap in Japan, United States, China, South Korea, and France.====FLFP among those aged above 15 in Japan is still lower than in the US but the gap is narrowing fast among those in the prime age. The wage gap is defined as the difference between the median earnings of men and women as a ratio of median earnings of men. This wage gap is shrinking everywhere, but Japan is still behind the U.S., with South Korea catching up from behind slowly. It is difficult to interpret the sparse observations in China.====As part of our study of policies and outcomes that may help achieve fiscal sustainability in Japan, we will consider the effects of an increase in the FLFP and narrowing the gap against male counterparts, whose participation rate stands at about 70%. We also consider scenarios to narrow the wage gap in Japan.====The key takeaway is that the demographic transitions are somewhat similar across major economies in the world and that increases in the FLFP or reductions in the wage gap may play a part in mitigating the fiscal burdens of aging. Japan happens to present a very strong case study with its already old population and the highest current old age dependency ratio.==== ====While debt to GDP ratios were relatively low in the early 1990s in Japan, successive fiscal stimulus packages and rising expenditures on the social security system have raised the quantity of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) to unusually high levels. Given the interest and concerns on how Japan would cope with the unprecedented demographic aging and fiscal challenges, there has been a growing literature on finding solutions to achieving fiscal sustainability. Broda and Weinstein (2005) estimate that fiscal sustainability is possible with small changes in the tax-to-GDP ratio. Doi et al. (2011), however, use the same fiscal instrument and argue that a very high tax rate, equivalent to an additional 11% of GDP, is required to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio when they use more recent data.====Imrohoroğlu et al. (2011) use a neoclassical growth model to examine the impact of a rise in the consumption tax rate from 5% to 15% on the primary deficit to GDP ratio. Despite a temporary improvement in the primary balance, they find that additional fiscal adjustments are needed to achieve fiscal sustainability. Imrohoroğlu et al. (2011) study effects of productivity growth and find that only a growth miracle, such as a 6% real growth rate over 10 years, would be necessary to bring the debt to GDP to a manageable level. Hoshi (2012) demonstrate that zombie financing and very large spending programs have driven the projected fiscal burden of the demographic transition. In addition to recommending fiscal discipline and major regulatory reforms, they also suggest opening up the Japanese economy by re-designing immigration policies.====Braun and Joines (2015) develop an overlapping generations model with the demographic transition and argue that in the absence of any reform, achieving fiscal sustainability will necessitate a consumption tax rate of about 30–45%. They show that a health care reform that raises the co-pay for the elderly to that for working age individuals, which is 30%, would contain the increase in the consumption tax to 23%. Kitao (2015) quantifies the fiscal cost of demographic transition and argues that pension reform to scale down benefits and raising the retirement age can significantly lower the fiscal burden, assisted by an increase in private saving and labor force participation in both intensive and extensive margins.====Hansen and İmrohoroğlu (2013) use a model with endogenous debt and show that the fiscal adjustment of about 30–40% of total consumption expenditures is necessary to maintain current promised levels of public pension and health services. Hoshi and Ito (2014) assess fiscal sustainability, and argue that there is an upper bound on the private sector’s ability to buy further JGBs and this threshold will be reached in around 2022 and the yields on JGBs will start to rise, even before 2022. This would then be followed by Greece-like events of severe fiscal consolidation, financial instability and even high inflation.====Imrohoroğlu et al. (2017) develop a general equilibrium model to measure the impact of alternative guest worker programs in Japan. Depending on the size and skill distribution of guest workers, they argue that these programs may mitigate Japan’s fiscal imbalance problem with a relatively manageable increase in the tax burden.==== Imrohoroğlu et al. (2016) build a microdata-founded overlapping generations structure calibrated to various micro data and official demographic projections and produce time paths for macroeconomic aggregates from 2010 to 2100. Their quantitative results suggest that the pension and non-pension related budget deficits both contribute to a rise in the fiscal burden in the long-run and argue that a combination of policy reforms and changes in the economic environment would be necessary to achieve a fiscal balance.==== ====The previous literature cited above abstracts from some key details of the social insurance programs and also restricts the amount of heterogeneity in agent types. In most cases, this is done for computational reasons and helps the paper focus on important aspects of the analysis of aging. In addition, this approach also is crucial in quantifying the welfare effects of various policy changes.====An alternative and complementary approach is to abstract from optimization but instead incorporate key details of the social insurance programs and also allow for a rich amount of agent heterogeneity. This paper builds a micro-data based, large-scale accounting model populated with overlapping generations of individuals for Japan in which agents differ in age, gender, employment status, income, and asset holdings, and incorporates the rules of the Japanese social insurance system, including the public pensions, health insurance and long-term care insurance in detail.====This paper extends Imrohoroğlu et al. (2016) in key dimensions and follows a strategy similar to Storesletten (2003), that uses a life-cycle structure with complete markets to assess the impact of immigration policies in Sweden. We calculate projections of future government budget balances and debt, and conduct counterfactual accounting exercises to assess the impact of various fiscal responses to future shocks and how these policies impact fiscal sustainability in Japan.====Most importantly, we treat not only the public pensions as in Imrohoroğlu et al. (2016), but also public health and long-term care insurances programs separately from other government expenditure and revenue items. We include detailed payment arrangements through the insurance programs, as well as the system of premium and copay payments that differ by age, employment types and earnings of individuals. We show that it is quantitatively important to incorporate finances of these insurance programs in evaluating the future paths of fiscal variables in Japan.====We also use the latest demographic projections and micro data to calibrate the benchmark economy and to compute the transition dynamics. We use age and gender specific projections of survival probabilities and population size based on the 2017 projection of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (IPSS).==== Our earnings estimates for employed workers are obtained from the most recent Basic Survey on Wage Structure (BSWS) in 2015, by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). For self-employed workers we use the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (NSFIE) in 2015. Our estimates of consumption profiles come from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.====Our main findings are summarized as follows. First, it is difficult to achieve fiscal sustainability with a single tool. This finding has not changed from that of Imrohoroğlu et al. (2016), but we quantify the breakdown of factors that contribute to the projected deficits and paths of expenditures and revenues of each social insurance program. The four expenditure items, (i) public pension, (ii) public health insurance, (iii) public long-term care insurance and (iv) interest payment on the public debt, will be nearly equally important in generating the path of rising government debt during the coming decades.====Second, there are strong and positive effects from higher productivity growth and increases in female employment (with wage increase and employment regularization). More female participation and increased earnings will not only increase income tax revenues but also the budgets of all three social insurance programs. A large effect occurs because of changes in the contribution they make to insurance programs, the amount of which is tied to various individual states and most importantly to the employment status in Japan. Efforts of policymakers in such directions will be essential for the fiscal soundness in the long-run. We note, however, these two items may be the most difficult to influence with a simple policy tool and they require significant structural reforms.====Third, increasing the consumption tax rate from the current 8% to 10% in 2019 reduces fiscal pressures in the short run. A further increase to a level that is comparable to other advanced economies would help alleviate accumulation of debt significantly.====Fourth, achieving fiscal sustainability is difficult but not impossible. For example, a combination of policies, raising the full retirement age to 67, cutting pension benefits by 10%, raising the copays in public medical expenditures and long-term care spending to 20%, increasing the female earnings and employment characteristics to those of men, and raising the consumption tax rate to 15%, achieves fiscal sustainability very quickly and leads to significant fiscal consolidation with a lower debt to GDP ratio in 2050 than that in 2020.====One shortcoming of our paper is that we do not model individual decisions on consumption/saving and labor/leisure choices. Therefore, our model is not suitable to conduct a welfare analysis to study the effects of reforms or the demographic change. We estimate life-cycle profiles of consumption, labor supply and earnings from the most recent Japanese micro data, derive individuals’ consumption at each age using these estimates and the present value of life time resources constraint under the complete markets assumption, back out the asset holdings from the period budget constraint, and use the 2017 IPSS demographic projections to produce forecasts of future fiscal and macroeconomic indicators. On the one hand, this is clearly a shortcoming of our approach. On the other hand, this abstraction allows us to incorporate significant details of the pension and health insurance systems in Japan, including the distinction of different categories of social insurance programs (public pension, health insurance and long-term care insurance), eligibility, non-linear functions of benefits and contributions/premium in each program. In addition, we capture the unique and important heterogeneity among the labor force, male versus female, regular, irregular (contingent) and self-employment, which have very important implications for the cash flow of the pension and public health and LTC programs and for the projections of fiscal variables in the future.====By incorporating such details, we are able to study effects of a number of policy changes that are currently debated in the policy circle, such as an increase in the normal retirement age and changes in the copay system of health and long-term care insurance programs, as well as some trends that have started to take place, such as a rise in FLFP, changes in their employment types and a rise of their relative wage.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Prammer Doris,"Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Otto-Wagner Platz 3, A-1090 Wien, Austria","Available online 21 December 2018, Version of Record 18 November 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeoa.2018.12.005,Cited by (7), also explain 1/6 th of the observed increase.,"The effects of rapid population ageing – observed in many advanced economies – on many aspects of the economy have gained increased attention amongst policy makers and academics alike. One key issue of concern is the impact of ageing on the budget and its effects on the sustainability of budgetary developments. While the literature has widely studied ageing-induced changes to public expenditures (e.g. European Commission, 2018, Balassone et al., 2011), the impact of a changing age structure on government revenues is less understood. People, by and large, earn less and consume differently when retired (Walder and Döring, 2012), but are on average more wealthy. Given that different types of income and different consumption goods are differentially taxed in many countries, demographic change has fiscal implications also on the revenue side.====In order to gauge these effects this paper conducts both a static and dynamic analysis to assess the impact of population ageing on income tax revenues and social security contributions until 2060. The static analysis utilizes three population scenarios to assess the effects of population ageing in a no-growth scenario with constant wages and pensions that, however, vary across age groups. The micro-simulation exploits the age-cohort specific information regarding income taxes and social security contributions available in administrative data (provided by Statistics Austria, 2017, Walder and Döring, 2012). The three population projections lead to slightly different results that, however, all point in the same direction. First, average per capita income tax and social security contributions decline, in the “worst” case by about 10 percent. Second, depending upon the demographic projection used this effect might even lead to an absolute reduction in revenues – despite a growing (but ageing) population.====Clearly, the static analysis has to be considered pessimistic as it ignores the impact of technological progress and hence increasing real wages and pensions over the projection period. These effects are added in the dynamic analysis, building upon pension payments projections derived in this paper and wage growth projections from Kaniovski et al. (2014). Given the aforementioned sensitivity of tax revenues and social security contributions on the status – working or retired – these numbers are paired with novel status specific tax elasticities to derive income taxes and social security contributions over the projection horizon. These status specific elasticities are estimated by quantile regressions run separately for working and retired individuals. The shift of the standardly used time-series approach to the cross-sectional dimension and the zooming in on quantile specific elasticities, makes effective use of the detailed microeconomic information in the administrative data. The main messages from the dynamic analyses are as follows: First, average per capita income tax and social security contributions grow. This implies, due to a growing population, a fortiori also increasing total income tax and social security contributions. Second, the percentage of income tax revenues and social security contributions in GDP increases up to 2060. To better understand these findings, the contributions of the three drivers of the results (increasing wages and pension payments, increasing population size and aggregated tax-to-base elasticities larger than one) are singled out in Section 5. As expected, the major drivers are increasing wages and pensions.====The paper builds on and extends the relatively scarce literature on the impact of population ageing on taxation. Felix and Watkins, 2013, Yashio and Hachisuka, 2014, Creedy et al., 2010, investigate the impact of population ageing on taxation for the US, Japan and New Zealand, respectively. They find that income tax revenues per capita will decrease considerably with the ageing of the population, while the effect on consumption/sales taxes is not so clear-cut. Their results are, however, based on a counterfactual analysis, which only takes into account demographic changes, but disregards any other changes to labour and pension income.====Note also that the results of the paper close a gap in the 2018 Ageing Report of European Commission that lacks income tax and social security contributions on pensions in Austria. Closing this gap thus allows us to compare the Austrian situation with other EU member states. The fiscal burden on pensions is already among the highest in Austria and is furthermore projected to increase considerably over the projection horizon. The increasing fiscal burden implies that the net burden of ageing on the budget is smaller than one would expect when considering only the developments on the expenditure side. Since the gross and net fiscal burden of ageing differs also markedly in other countries (e.g. Poland and Italy), the net pension burden is a more comparable and useful indicator to assess sustainability of public finances.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 sketches basic facts about the Austrian personal income tax system. It also provides cohort-specific income and tax liabilities based on administrative data and displays the demographic projections used. Based on this, section 3 explores the pure effects of population ageing on income tax and social security contributions using microeconomic simulations in a counterfactual setting. Section 4 projects pension expenditure up to 2060 and associated revenues from income taxes and social security contributions based on newly estimated tax elasticities in a dynamic setting. Section 5 uses wage projections to evaluate the effect of population ageing on overall tax and social security revenue in a dynamic setting. Finally, section 6 concludes.",How does population ageing impact on personal income taxes and social security contributions?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300586,21 December 2018,2018,Research Article,151.0

This trend is driven by deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related diseases, termed as ","Overall, life expectancy in most high-income countries is increasing over time. Mid-age mortality has become less of an issue for most of these countries and thus received only minor public attention in the past years. However, studies for the US show that, since 1998, mortality rates in midlife are increasing for white non-Hispanics (Case and Deaton, 2015, Case and Deaton, 2017). This trend is driven by deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related diseases, termed as ====, and by the subgroup of low-educated individuals. This points at rising inequality in mortality by socioeconomic status within this ethnic group. Case and Deaton (2017) argue that the mechanism behind this development is likely to be the deterioration of life circumstances for low-educated white non-Hispanics over time, e.g. worsening of employment opportunities or increasing instability of marriages.==== At the same time (Case and Deaton, 2015, Case and Deaton, 2017) illustrate that in several other high-income countries, including Germany, average mortality in midlife continued to decrease after 1998. However, since the average mortality rates can disguise important differences between specific subgroups, it is unclear if the phenomenon of increasing mortality rates is also present for subpopulations in these countries.====In this paper, we focus on Germany by analyzing the trend in mortality rates for the middle-aged by gender, marital status, and migrant background across both East and West Germany. Germany is particularly interesting because middle-aged individuals in East Germany lived through a period of severe changes due to the reunification of Germany in 1990. The transition for East Germany was remarkable: The socialist system that had prevailed for decades was changed to the West German setup of a social market economy. This led to higher average incomes, but also to substantial discontinuities in employment careers and to exclusion from the labor market (Mayer, 2006). About 75% of East German workers left their employer of 1989 and more than 40% experienced a spell of unemployment before 1996. Over the same time period, the unemployment rate in East Germany increased from around 1 to more than 20 percent (Krueger and Pischke, 1995, Goedicke, 2006, Goedicke, 2006). There were also drastic developments in fertility, marriage, and divorce rates in East Germany in the years around reunification (Nolte, 2000). The age-standardized all-cause mortality rate for East German men and women increased slightly immediately after reunification.==== In the 1990s, it decreased faster than for West German men and women, respectively, due to a substantial improvement in medical care in East Germany, a rapid change in diet because of greater availability of fruits and vegetable oils, and improving living standards (Nolte et al., 2000, Diehl, 2008, Kibele, 2012, Vogt and Vaupel, 2015). Since the early 2000s, women in East and West Germany have similar all-cause mortality rates and life expectancy at birth, while there is a stagnating gap between East and West German men (Robert Koch Institute, 2011, Vogt and Vaupel, 2015).====We extend the analyses of Case and Deaton, 2015, Case and Deaton, 2017 for Germany in the time period from 1990 to 2015, analyzing how mortality in midlife changed for East and West German subpopulations with a focus on deaths of despair. For this study, we use the official cause-of-death statistics (“Todesursachenstatistik”) in which all deaths and the reasons of deaths are recorded. We follow the analysis in Case and Deaton (2017) and calculate the mortality rates of the 50–54 age group, defined as the number of deaths in the given age group per 100,000 persons at risk. As a sensitivity analysis, we also look at mortality rates of the neighboring age groups 40–44, 45–49, and 55–59.====Our results show a very clear pattern. We find that mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2015, with no increases in deaths of despair for any of the subgroups. Thus, our findings stand in contrast with the experience in the US. Reasons for this difference might be related to the German welfare system, which provides a more generous safety net in dimensions essential to life.",Mortality in midlife for subgroups in Germany,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300550,13 December 2018,2018,Research Article,152.0

The costs are borne by families, by private insurance and by society via public programs such as Medicaid in the U.S.. There is extensive research on the relationship between dementia and ==== medical spending. This paper, instead, estimates cumulative ","Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning such as thinking, remembering and reasoning, and of the ability to perform the activities of daily life. Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementias (e.g. due to a stroke) are the most common forms of dementia. Dementia affects a large number of older adults. In 2010, about 4.2 million U.S. adults (or about 14.7% of the 70 + years old) and more than 36 million around the world lived with dementia (Hurd et al., 2013, Prince et al., 2013). Because age is a strong risk factor, and life expectancies are increasing, the prevalence of dementia may continue to grow.====Dementia is also a very costly condition, primarily because affected individuals need nursing care. The care can be provided in formal settings, such as in nursing homes, or it can be informally supplied by family members, friends or others in the community. Parts of these costs are paid by families, private insurance or by public programs, such as Medicaid in the U.S. There is extensive research on the relationship between dementia and annual medical expenditures. The total economic impact of dementia was estimated at $200 billion per year in the United States (Hurd et al., 2013) and $600 billion worldwide, or about 1% of global GDP (Wimo et al., 2013), making dementia the most expensive medical condition. The distribution of the costs was also found uneven across regions. Even though only about 40% of people with dementia live in high income countries, these countries are responsible for almost 90% of the total costs (Wimo et al., 2017). Less attention has been paid in the literature to whether and to what extent the costs of dementia vary by socio-economic status (SES) ==== countries.====From the perspective of society, these overall annual costs are important to know, but from the perspective of a family or individual, ==== (as opposed to annual) costs are more relevant, because individuals need to be prepared to cover all of these cumulative costs. Similarly, insurance companies that supply long-term care (LTC) insurance are also interested in the lifetime risk of dementia, which is an important factor in optimally pricing their financial products.====In Hudomiet et al. (2018a), we estimated the lifetime risk of dementia in the U.S. using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We found that 41% of Americans who died after the age of 65 lived with dementia for at least half a year. We build on that work to estimate how the lifetime risk of dementia affects lifetime out-of-pocket (OOP) medical expenditures from age 65 to death, holding other variables constant; and we estimate how these costs vary by SES. To simplify language, we will sometimes refer to lifetime OOP medical expenditures as “lifetime costs.”====We use the HRS, which has several unique features for studying dementia-related outcomes: 1) It is a large, nationally representative, longitudinal dataset with a wide range of information about health status, cognitive abilities, SES, demographics, and other variables. 2) It has good coverage of the population with dementia, because it follows individuals into nursing homes; and proxy interviews are available for cognitively impaired sample members. 3) It collects EXIT interviews after the death of sample members, including questions about end-of-life medical expenditures that are known to be disproportionally higher than spending at younger ages. And 4) a subset of HRS members were administered a clinical assessment for dementia within the Aging, Demographics and Memory Study (ADAMS), which we use to calibrate the cognitive variables that are available in the entire HRS.====To estimate lifetime expenditures we add up any OOP medical expenditures of individuals between age 65 and death. However, the HRS is still not long enough to fully observe all individuals’ complete lifetimes. We thus chose a baseline cohort aged 74–79 in the 1998 wave, followed them from 1998 to 2014, and accumulated all their reported OOP health care spending. Their medical spending between age 65 and the baseline age of 74–79 is therefore missing, which is a left-censoring problem. Moreover, about a fifth of the final sample survive to the 2014 wave (or leave the panel), which is a right-censoring problem. We impute spending by these censored cases using a nonparametric matching algorithm called “splicing” that is based on a methodology developed in our earlier research (Hurd et al., 2017). Right-censored individuals are matched to people with similar characteristics in older HRS cohorts, who are observed at the relevant ages all the way to death. For example, if a person was 85 years old (and alive) in 2014, we matched him or her to someone who was 85 years old in 1998, and who was similar in other dimensions, such as gender, lifetime earnings, marital status, dementia probabilities, OOP medical expenditures and nursing home residence. Then we borrowed the values from this donor person to fill up the missing values of the recipient. Left censoring was imputed with a similar methodology, but in this case we used younger HRS cohorts as donors. By choosing late enough baseline ages of 74–79, most of our sample are observed to die within the HRS, and do not need right splicing. To preserve the correlations among explanatory variables our method borrows all donor variables together, including left- and right-hand side variables of regressions, and therefore the relationships among the regression variables are not (necessarily) affected by occasional mismatches between donors and recipients. This method has the advantage over parametric methods that it captures better the extreme upper tail of spending. We carried out extensive robustness checks of this methodology and found it very reliable.====We found that the mean lifetime OOP spending from age 65 to death is $61 thousand in 2014 dollars, assuming a 0% discount rate. Those who live with dementia for at least six months pay, on average, $38.5 thousand more out of pocket (about 60% of the mean OOP) when controlling for length of life, demographics, lifetime earnings and comorbidities. When we looked at medical expenditure subcategories, we found that spending on nursing homes is statistically significantly higher for those with dementia, while none of the other spending categories were related to dementia after the other control variables were included in the regressions. These results were expected, and they may suggest that the control variables adequately adjusted for the differences between those who live with dementia and the rest of the population. We also found that the cost of dementia is significantly lower for blacks, Hispanics, and low SES individuals (measured by education or lifetime earnings), while we found weaker and not statistically significant differences by gender. Even though high SES individuals living with dementia spend significantly more on nursing homes than low SES individuals, we found little difference in lifetime nursing home usage between these groups. This suggests that Medicaid, which only provides financial support for nursing home care for poor families, significantly reduces inequalities in the population that lives with dementia in the U.S.","The relationship between lifetime out-of-pocket medical expenditures, dementia, and socioeconomic status in the U.S",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300690,30 November 2018,2018,Research Article,156.0

In this study, we examine the dynamic relationship between health and consumption over the elderly life course. In doing so, we shed light on the potential impact of policies that promote health equity on broader economic inequality among the elderly.====Adverse health shocks may influence individual or household consumption through a variety of mechanisms. These effects could be contemporaneous, for example through increased expenditures on medical care, reduced earnings, or decreased consumption of goods and services that are complements to good health. Or there could be dynamic effects that persist over time, for example through forced early retirement or perhaps even expedited death. In any case, these channels suggest that variations in health may explain, at least partly, the disparate consumption patterns observed across socioeconomic groups in the U.S. This relationship could be especially important at older ages where mortality rates are high and most of the variance in health across individuals is concentrated (Deaton and Paxson, 1998).====Understanding the extent to which health differences influence consumption inequality is a challenging task. Health is a multidimensional concept with many proposed subjective and objective measures (e.g. self-rated health, physical limitations, incidence of morbidities, etc). Different types of health events can impact consumption, both current and future, with varying intensities—a cardiac event may have a stronger and more persistent effect on consumption than hypertension. There is also the possibility of dynamic spillovers across health conditions—hypertension is a risk factor known to increase the likelihood of other adverse health outcomes including death (Ettehad et al., 2016). Finally, individuals with similar annual consumption but substantially different lifespans will have very different total lifetime consumption. Moreover, the life-cycle hypothesis suggests an unexpected health shock could potentially increase contemporaneous consumption if there is an associated decline in life expectancy. In these cases, cross-sectional associations between consumption and health would only be presenting a part of the bigger story.====In light of these potentially dynamic and multi-faceted influences, we take a life-cycle approach to better quantify the total contribution of health disparities to differential consumption patterns over elderly life in the U.S. Using a similar framework as Miller and Bairoliya (2018), we estimate a panel vector autoregressive (VAR) model to approximate the joint evolution of consumption, mortality, and a multivariate measure of health over the elderly life-cycle. We use longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) supplemented with the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS). Together, these provide a long and rich panel (1992–2014) for studying the joint distribution of health and consumption for the elderly. We use the estimated system to simulate and analyze potential outcome paths for a sub-sample of HRS respondents. Using the simulated paths for consumption and mortality, we construct a measure of the net present value of expected remaining lifetime consumption (NPVC) at age sixty. This measure, which can also be viewed as an age sixty wealth equivalent, provides a parsimonious setup for studying both the contemporaneous as well as dynamic effects of health in driving consumption differences.====In order to examine the influence of health disparities on consumption inequality, we study differences across educational attainment levels. We choose to focus on this socioeconomic dimension as substantial education gradients have been well documented in health and mortality (Conti et al., 2010, Pijoan-Mas and Ríos-Rull, 2014) as well as income (Houthakker, 1959, Morgan and David, 1963, Griliches and Mason, 1972). It is well known that income differences across education groups primarily stem from differential returns to education. While some of these income differences may further translate into health differences due to differential access to medical goods and services, studies show that differences in health outcomes are also due to differences in health behaviors (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010), knowledge capital (Kenkel, 1991) and adherence to medication (Goldman and Smith, 2002). We do not focus on the reasons underlying the observed education gradients in health and consumption in this analysis, rather we ask how much of the education-consumption gradient can be attributed to health disparities across education groups. We further decompose how much of the gradient can be explained by differences in initial (age sixty) health distribution versus the differential evolution of health and mortality after age sixty across these groups.====Our main results are summarized as follows: we first document a substantial education gradient in cross-sectional consumption at age sixty—average consumption of college graduates is 2.5 times higher than high school dropouts. This ratio rises to 3.0 when examining NPVC—our estimate of elderly lifetime consumption. This rise is due to a positive correlation between consumption, health, and longevity. For example, we estimate that the average life expectancy of college graduates at age sixty is 5.3 years longer than high school dropouts. So not only are the college educated enjoying more average consumption in the cross-section, they enjoy the consumption for a longer and healthier period of time.====Our second set of results quantify the influence of health disparities on the education-consumption gradient. First, we find that conditional on health, differential survival rates across education groups actually explain very little of the gap in NPVC. The reason is that we do not find a strong education gradient in mortality rates after controlling for health. This finding is consistent with those reported by Pijoan-Mas and Ríos-Rull (2014). The authors also find that education, wealth, and income have very little impact on survival conditional on health. We do find, however, that the differential evolution of health can explain an important share of the estimated consumption disparities. For instance, eliminating differential elderly health transitions after sixty (mortality, morbidities, and subjective health) across education groups can close an estimated 4.7% of the educational gradient in NPVC between college graduates and high school dropouts at age sixty. However, this is a lower bound of the overall effect as part of the gradient is driven by initial age sixty health conditions. When we give the initial health distribution of the college graduates to those with less than a high school education, the consumption gradient closes by 5.7%. Altogether, we estimate that the distribution of health at age sixty and subsequent health transitions combine to explain approximately 10.5% of the gap in NPVC between college graduates and high school dropouts at age sixty—and 11.5% of the gap between college graduates and high school graduates.====Our paper broadly contributes to a growing body of work studying the distribution of individual and household consumption (Krueger and Perri, 2003, Deaton and Paxson, 1994, Dynarski et al., 1997, Cutler et al., 1991) along several dimensions. We establish a significant education-consumption gradient at older ages and document that inequality across education groups accounts for a substantial share of the total inequality in elderly lifetime consumption. We also argue that cross-sectional consumption differences may underestimate the true nature of consumption disparities among the elderly and propose NPVC as an alternate measure for studying the distribution of consumption. Moreover, while previous studies have explored the role of income inequality in explaining consumption differences (Krueger and Perri, 2006, Cutler and Katz, 1992, Blundell and Preston, 1998, Aguiar and Bils, 2015), we provide an estimate of the impact of health. Finally, we add to the existing work looking at the importance of health disparities in explaining economic inequality (Shastry and Weil, 2003, Bloom et al., 2004). While these studies have looked at the importance of population health differences in explaining cross-country income differences, we are able to provide new insights by exploring the importance of health and mortality in explaining consumption inequality within the U.S.====Our paper is most closely related to two existing studies—Pijoan-Mas and Ríos-Rull (2014) and Miller and Bairoliya (2018). The former looks at the importance of initial health distribution versus differential health and mortality transitions at older ages in explaining differences in life expectancy at age fifty. We focus on analyzing the role of health in explaining consumption differences and also use a broader indicator of health, incorporating several morbidities and physical limitations. Miller and Bairoliya (2018) estimates the welfare distribution of the elderly and its change over time. We use a similar modeling approach in this paper to understand the relationship between health and consumption inequality at older ages. We estimate the education gradient in consumption and document the importance of educational differences in explaining overall consumption inequality. We also conduct decomposition exercises to quantify the impact of health on elderly consumption disparities.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Individual decisions are conceptualized as the partial control of impulsive desires of a short-run self (the limbic system) by a rationally forward-looking long-run self (the prefrontal cortex). The short-run self strives for immediate gratification through consumption of food and other goods. The long-run self reflects the consequences of eating behavior on weight gain and health, exercises to lose weight, invests money to improve health and saves for health expenditure in old age. Not conceding to short-run desires, however, entails an idiosyncratic utility cost of self-control. The model is calibrated to match food expenditure, exercise, and other choices of an average U.S. American. The results suggests that imperfect self-control reduces average lifetime by up to five years. I use the model to analyze the role of self-control, income, food prices, energy density, and medical progress in explaining obesity and to develop a test on whether obesity is driven by excessive desire for food or lack of self-control. .","In the year 2016, worldwide, 39 percent of adults were overweight and 13 percent were obese. In developed countries, the median citizen is typically overweight and between 20 percent and more than 40 percent are obese. U.S. Americans are particularly big (67.9 percent overweight and 36.2 percent obese), yet other countries are catching up quickly (WHO, 2018).====Elevated body mass promotes the development of health deficits and premature death. Overweight and obesity increase the risk of heart disease, ischemic stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers (including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon cancer) as well as osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders. The WHO estimates that, worldwide, at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese.====The unhealthy built-up of excess body mass could, in principle, be avoided by consuming less calories or burning more calories (through physical exercise and other activities). The fact that it is seemingly so straightforward to avoid overweight makes the phenomenon a particulary fascinating object of investigation for economists who believe in rational decision making and long-term planning. The present paper aims to contribute to this literature by developing a life cycle model in which individuals understand the consequences of food consumption and exercise on health deficit accumulation, longevity, and lifetime utility.====A straightforward way to explain the diversity of BMI-phenotypes is to focus on differences in preferences for food or physical (in-) activity and maintain the conventional assumption of individuals as fully rational planers. I argue below that this line of reasoning is not entirely convincing in the context of a life cycle model when health outcomes and longevity are endogenous. It would imply the prediction that heavier individuals exercise more when the argument is based on varying food preferences or that heavier individuals eat less when the argument is based on varying preferences for (in-) activity. At the minimum, it would thus beg the question for why food preferences and activity preferences are correlated.====Here, I suggest an alternative explanation, based on present-biased preferences, that motivates varying body sizes without resorting to differences in preferences for food or physical exercise. Specifically, food consumption and exercise and their effects on health outcomes and longevity are discussed in a life cycle model of imperfect self-control based on Thaler and Shefrin (1981) and Fudenberg and Levine (2006). This approach formalizes the notion that humans are neither mere “cold” long-run planners nor “hot” affective persons by considering a dual-self consisting of a rational long-run self who partly controls the impulsive actions of a short-run self. Self-control is costly in terms of utility, reflecting the pain from not conceding to the cravings of the short-run self for, for example, another icecream or a leisurely evening on the couch. The cost of self-control is increasing in the deviation of the constrained optimal solution from the optimal solution preferred by the short-run self.====The dual-self model provides a particular, psychological view on the role of impatience and present bias for human decision making. In economics, these phenomena are usually addressed by the modeling of a discount rate that individuals apply to utility experienced in the future. In health economics, several studies have found that individuals who heavily discount the future are more likely to be obese, to exercise less, and to perform fewer health maintenance activities (Komlos et al., 2004, Bradford, 2010, Lawless et al., 2013, Bradford et al., 2017, Courtemanche et al., 2015). The conventional model of exponential discounting is a useful tool for analyzing the impact of (rational) impatience for health behavior. It is, however, unsuitable for addressing present bias stemming from affective (irrational) behavior. For that purpose, it has been proposed to use hyperbolically declining discount rates.====While it is undisputed that individual decisions are subject to a strong present bias (for surveys, see Frederick et al., 2002, DellaVigna, 2009), it is less clear whether hyperbolic discounting is the best way to describe affective behavior and self-control problems. According to conventional wisdom, hyperbolic discounting necessarily involves time-inconsistent decision making (see e.g. Angeletos et al., 2001, Cawley and Ruhm, 2012). It is possible, however, to propose empirically plausible forms of hyperbolic discounting that support time-consistent decisions.====. Strulik and Trimborn (forthcoming) have recently integrated time-consistent hyperbolic discounting into a standard life cycle model. They showed that hyperbolically discounting individuals invest more in their health, spend less on unhealthy goods, and live longer than they would if they had a constant time preference rate. This suggests that, if hyperbolic discounting is associated with inferior health behavior, the cause is not the present-bias as such but the entailed inconsistency of decision making. These considerations may be helpful for an assessment of the sometimes inconclusive studies on the impact of hyperbolic discounting on health behavior (e.g. Khwaja et al., 2007). Time-inconsistent hyperbolic discounting also involves difficult conceptual problems. First, it needs to address how individuals deal with their inconsistency problem (in a naive or sophisticated way). Second, the question arises as to whose welfare should be considered by policy interventions. It is thus useful to have an alternative modeling device of present-biased decision making, which models behavior that is time-consistent yet suboptimal from the perspective of a rational long-run planner.====Conceptually, the dual-self model is closer to the notion of multiple simultaneously-operating brain systems in psychology and neuroscience. It takes into account insights from neurology showing that different areas of the brain are occupied with short-run (impulsive) behavior and long-run (planned) behavior (McClure et al., 2004, Bechara, 2005, Hare et al., 2009). Affective states are triggered by the evolutionary older limbic system, which responds to stimuli without accounting for long-term consequences. Abstract thinking and long-term planning are located in the prefrontal cortex, the evolutionary newest area of the brain. The degree by which processes in the prefrontal cortex inhibit and override processes of the limbic system is called self-control or willpower and it is person-specific (i.e. brain-specific).====A series of empirical studies have provided evidence for imperfect self-control as a driver of impulsive consumption and low investment in general (Shiv and Fedorikhin, 1999, Baumeister, 2002, Ameriks et al., 2007) as well as driver of unhealthy eating (Crescioni et al., 2011, Dassen et al., 2015, Stutzer and Meier, 2016) and lack of physical exercise (Bogg and Roberts, 2004, Della Vigna and Malmendier, 2006, Cobb-Clark et al., 2014, Conell-Price and Jamison, 2015). Low self-control in childhood is a strong predictor of health and financial status in adulthood (Moffitt et al., 2011). Adolescents with low self-control develop more health deficits later in life (Miller et al., 2011) and individuals with low self-control tend to die earlier (Kern and Friedman, 2008).====Inferences about causality, however, are difficult to obtain from empirical studies because there exists no counterfactual or treatment group. Since we cannot observe the same person twice, both with and without self-control (aside from rare exceptions, Naqvi et al., 2007), there remains an identification problem. This makes it hard to assess how much low self-control contributes to inferior health behavior and premature death. Here, I suggest addressing this problem with counterfactual computational experiments. I calibrate a dual-self life cycle model of health behavior for a Reference American with limited self-control and then perform a counterfactual exercise by removing the self-control problem.====It should be noted that the method of counterfactual experiments is not meant as a replacement of econometric analysis. It is a complementing, alternative method of inference that is particularly designed to avoid some problems like those originating from backward causality and omitted variables. In the present context, for example, one can easily imagine that self-control also influences variables other than eating, exercising, and health investments. A plausible channel, for example, would be work effort such that self-control exerts an indirect effect on health through income. The perhaps most useful feature of computational experiments is that certain channels of influence can be shut down by design. In the example, by holding income constant, the computational experiment controls for the impact that self-control could have through income or other confounders on health behavior and health outcomes.====The life cycle model of health deficit accumulation (Dalgaard and Strulik, 2014) is a an appropriate tool with which to discuss how current unhealthy behavior affects the deterioration of bodily function and causes premature death. It is particularly useful for quantitative explorations since it employs a straightforward measure of health that has been well-established in gerontology, the health deficit index.==== The health deficit (or frailty) index measures the number of health deficits that a person has at a given age relative to the number of potential health deficits. It was introduced by Mitnitski et al. (2002) and has instigated a very large body of literature in the medical sciences.====The health deficit model is integrated with the dual-self model in order to discuss the impact of limited self-control on food consumption, exercise, health investments, obesity, health deficit accumulation, and longevity.==== The model is calibrated to match food expenditure, exercise, and other choices of an average U.S. American and then used for counterfactual computational experiments in order to assess the importance of self-control problems for health behavior and premature death.====A static dual-self model of food consumption has been proposed by Ruhm (2012). Naturally, the impact of current eating behavior on the future development of health deficits and on longevity cannot be discussed in a static framework. A dynamic dual-self model in the context of health deficit accumulation has been developed in Strulik (2018b). The present paper applies this framework to discuss self-control problems in food consumption and extends it by considering self-control problems in physical exercise. Food consumption and exercise interact as determinants of body mass, health deficit accumulation, and the length of life.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the model and introduces the key assumptions and mechanisms. In Section 3, the model is calibrated for a 20-year-old American man (called the Reference American). Section 4 presents life cycle behavior and health outcomes for the Reference American and an otherwise identical person without self-control problems. The results suggests that imperfect self-control reduces average lifetime by up to five years. After scrutinizing this finding with extensive robustness checks, we investigate the role of food prices, income, and medical progress for eating behavior and body weight and use the model to develop a test for whether obesity is driven by excessive desire for food or lack of self-control. Section 5 concludes with limitations and potential extensions for future work.","I shouldn’t eat this donut: Self-control, body weight, and health in a life cycle model",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X18300707,2 November 2018,2018,Research Article,164.0

Notwithstanding this similarity of structure, however, the two systems are very different. The Netherlands mandates annuitized drawdown structures. In Australia, no prescription, or even guidance, is offered. In both cases, products that better meet the needs of increasingly heterogeneous retirement cohorts are under consideration. We analyze the impact of various popular product choices in the Netherlands and in Australia on the welfare of individuals allowing for different income levels. The study assumes the market return and mortality are stochastic and includes the impact of mean-testing, which reduces the value of the first pillar flat rate. Products offering longevity insurance are the most preferred in the absence of bequest, whereas more flexible portfolios with phased withdrawals score higher when individuals have a bequest motive. The state pension replaces the need to purchase indexed annuities for low income individuals whereas it does not crowd out the demand for longevity insurance for median and high income percentiles. We conclude that the income category, bequests, state pension and risk aversion have to be allowed for in any sound welfare assessment of retirement income portfolios since these affect the ranking of portfolios more sharply than mortality differentials and loadings.","The Dutch and the Australian retirement systems are widely regarded as amongst the best in the world and highly ranked in the MMGPI (2016). The two countries combine an unfunded non-contributory flat rate pension with prefunded earnings related retirement schemes. Notwithstanding this similarity of structure, however, the two systems are very different in their decumulation stage (García-Huitrón and Ponds, 2015). The Netherlands mandates annuitized drawdown structures (Brown and Nijman, 2012). In Australia, no prescription, or even guidance, is offered (Bateman et al., 2001). Jointly studying these two countries allows us to assess the effect of the institutional setting in the individual’s welfare. Our goal is to provide an answer to the following question: ‘====’. More specifically, we perform a standardized comparison of retirement portfolios with varying levels of prescription and flexibility in both a defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit (DB) paradigm.====A natural way to analyse the comparability of retirement income products is to perform a welfare analysis, that is, to analyse the utility drawn from a certain retirement income portfolio choice. Commonly, an innovative retirement product is compared to the classical lifetime annuity payout. For instance De Waegenaere et al., 2010, Horneff et al., 2010, Post, 2012 study the portfolio choice between a classical and a deferred annuity, that is, a product which pays a lifetime income after a contractually specified period conditional on survival. They find that deferred annuities can improve welfare of risk-averse individuals substantially because they insure against increases in annuity prices and provide a smooth income if individuals live longer than expected.====Similarly, Doyle et al., 2004, Milevsky and Kyrychenko, 2008, Horneff et al., 2010 compare variable with classical annuities and find that individuals should not fully annuitize their wealth, even without bequest motives, and rather enhance their welfare by holding an equity portfolio and matching their consumption with withdrawals. More recently, product innovations such as group self-annuitization (GSA) and phased withdrawals have been considered in Hanewald et al. (2013). They show that a GSA can outperform inflation-linked annuities when there are loadings and that portfolios with phased withdrawals improve individuals’ welfare when they have a bequest motive. In the same vein, Boon et al. (2018) show that individuals marginally prefer the GSA scheme over a fairly priced annuity.====In the Netherlands, choice flexibility has not been a part of the pension discussion until very recently (Dellaert et al., 2014). Besides varying the timing of the payout phase, few innovations have been made in the construction of the payments. In particular, flexible payouts such as the ‘high-low’ and ‘low–high’ arrangements have been introduced. The first arrangement allows the individual to have a higher payout during the first five years followed by a lower payout during the remainder of their retirement. However, most individuals do not choose this payout construction (Dellaert et al., 2014), and those who do tend to combine it with early retirement to compensate for the lower state pension during the first five years (Willemsen, 2015). Furthermore, the higher payments in early retirement seem to provide the same welfare as taking up to 10% of the pension wealth as a lump sum (van Ewijk et al., 2017). Despite the limited choice and prescription in The Netherlands, both Australians and Dutch have choices to make and preferences are expected to be influenced by their heterogeneous attitude towards risk, income category and mortality (Bateman et al., 2001).====We perform a simulation-based welfare study of retirement product portfolios found in Australia and the Netherlands allowing for individual exposures to equity and mortality risk (Brown, 2001). We assume that the retiree fully consumes the payouts from the retirement portfolio and does not have additional savings following other decumulation risk management studies of Horneff et al., 2008, Hanewald et al., 2013.==== The main implication of this approach is that bequests and consumption, and our comparisons, reflect differing institutional characteristics and resulting drawdown structures, which is the aim of our study.====We study the phased withdrawal, nominal and indexed annuities, and combinations of them for the flexible Australian case. For the Netherlands, individuals can choose either an indexed annuity, ‘high-low’ or ‘low-high’ arrangement. We assess the impact of the strength of a bequest motive, annuity loadings and differences in life expectancy for different income categories (commonly known as ‘mortality differentials’) on individual welfare. We compare the products with respect to the Certainty Equivalent Consumption (====), which represents the yearly constant consumption that yields the same utility that the studied portfolio,==== and the Portfolio Equivalent Wealth, which indicates the worth of the retirement income stream.====We consider the welfare gain of including state pensions, means-tested for the Australian setting and flat for the Dutch setting. Generally, means-tested pensions create incentives to reduce wealth in order to have access to government support (Bütler et al., 2017) and to increase the allocation to risky assets, since the state pension acts as a buffer for downside risk (Andreasson et al., 2017). Similarly, life-cycle modeling suggests that individuals will view their means-tested pension as longevity protection, despite the increasing regulatory risk which affects the income and asset tests (Iskhakov et al., 2015).====Our study contributes to the financial planning literature by providing a comprehensive comparison of two institutional settings with distinct features in regards to prescription and government support. The Australian setting pays a means-tested pension and offers the possibility to create portfolios which combine longevity insurance through the purchase of annuities and equity exposure through phased withdrawal products. The Dutch setting offers a flat pension rate, which serves the purpose of poverty alleviation, and a supplementary lifetime defined benefit income commonly based on lifetime wages. We assess the welfare associated to various portfolios for stylized individuals which have different earnings and mortality expectations. The comparison aims to inform policy by showing the gain associated with offering liquidity options. Partial annuitization remains optimal for most income categories, highlighting the need to develop annuity markets that can share the longevity risk currently borne by the state.====The optimal retirement income product portfolio is shown to be most affected by the bequest motive, means-testing of the first pillar pension and the level of income. Interestingly, mortality differentials and product loadings are less significant factors. In the absence of a bequest, products providing longevity protection are the most welfare enhancing and rank highest in Australia and The Netherlands. A highly prescribed setting, such as the Dutch case, that offers limited choice at retirement may be the most cost-effective in enhancing individual welfare.====The results suggest that a fair annuity from defined contribution retirement wealth can provide higher welfare than the (Dutch) defined benefit product. Once a bequest motive is included, products that provide more flexibility and liquidity rank higher especially for the lowest income percentile. In the presence of a bequest motive, portfolios with partial annuitization are preferred, especially for individuals from the highest income percentile, who live on average longer than the population.====Pricing assumptions that include loadings make annuities less attractive but not enough to be less preferred than a phased withdrawal product in the absence of a bequest. Risk attitude affects the ranking of portfolios, especially for the lowest income percentile. The state pension crowds-out indexed annuities for low income individuals but does not crowd out the demand for longevity insurance for median and high income percentiles. For our assumptions, mortality differentials do not affect the product rankings substantially.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the modeling of the financial market, mortality risk and utility framework and describes the financial products which will be considered in our analysis. Section 3 presents the data and assumptions used in our analysis and compares the retirement income portfolios for Australia and The Netherlands in the presence and absence of a means-tested state pension. Section 4 studies the sensitivity of our results to risk attitude, subjective discount factor, bequest motive, loadings and mortality differentials. Finally, Section 5 concludes.",One size fits all?

Using data from the relevant waves of the Health and Retirement Study, we exploit the exogenous variation resulting from the value of housing assets during the ==== to examine the effect of housing ==== on use of home health, unpaid help and nursing home care by older adults. Consistent with the idea that individuals consume part of their housing equity during an emergency, we find evidence of a significant increase in the use of paid home health care, nursing home and unpaid informal care. The intensity of unpaid care, however, was not affected. We conduct a placebo test on individuals who do not own property; their use of LTSS was not affected by the housing ==== changes. Taken together, the findings suggest that a housing wealth shock exerts a positive and significant effect on the uptake of home health and nursing home entry and some effect on the probability of unpaid care, but no significant effect on the intensity of unpaid care.","One key social policy question facing most western societies is how best to fund long term services and supports (LTSS) in aging populations. About half of adults that reach the age of 65 can expect to use some long term services and supports before they die (Favreault and Dey, 2015). Among those who will use LTSS, the expected present discounted value of the services they would use is estimated at $133,700 in 2015 dollars. Roughly 5% of men and 12% of women age 65 and over will incur costs for LTSS of more than $250,000 in present discounted 2015 dollars before they die (Favreault and Dey, 2015). In the United States, private insurance for LTSS is limited and pays for only about 10% of LTSS expenditures. Public insurance, specifically Medicaid, accounts for about 35% of LTSS spending. As a result, about half of all spending for LTSS is paid for out-of-pocket by service users and their families. Housing assets play an important role and thus serve as a “self-insurance” mechanism. However, to date evidence of the effect of housing wealth shocks on LTSS use is limited.====Housing assets have historically been the main source of non-pension wealth of Americans (Venti and Wise, 1991). This is especially the case for older adults: 72% of Americans 65 years of age and older are homeowners, and most continue to be homeowners at older ages (ASPE, 2016). The median per capita net value (after accounting for debt) of housing assets of older adults is about $80,000 in 2015 dollars. That amounts to 67% of the median per capita net worth of adults over the age of 65. Because housing wealth is the largest source of savings that can be used to pay for unexpected health shocks that involve LTSS, we seek to understand how a housing wealth shock affects individual long-term care decisions.====Given housing wealth’s key role in people’s precautionary savings, one would expect changes in household housing wealth to influence the capacity to self-fund LTSS. Establishing the causal links between housing wealth and use of LTSS is complicated, however. Unobservable factors that drive housing wealth accumulation may also affect the demand for LTSS later in life (Garber, 1989). Indeed, most individuals save ‘generically’ for their retirement years, a time when they may expect to have to pay more for medical services as well as LTSS====. The latter implicitly assumes that housing wealth influences decisions regarding LTSS. Given the variation across the United States in how much housing prices have grown over the past four decades – years when people currently aged 65 and older might have first bought homes – differences in housing wealth may have a significant impact on how elderly Americans are able to pay for LTSS in the next decade or two. In particular, such differences may affect federal and state expenditures for Medicaid. Thus, there are significant public policy implications if a change in housing assets is found to have a causal effect on the demand for different types of LTCSS. The purpose of this paper is to determine if such a causal effect exists.====In this paper, we focus on housing wealth shocks created by the Great Recession’s induced movements in housing prices in the United States. Our identification strategy relies on observing changes in patterns of use of LTSS in response to housing wealth shocks created exogenously by the Great Recession (2006–2010). We observe the variation in housing values starting with the real estate boom that began in the first quarter of 1998, through to the beginning of the housing bubble burst in the first quarter of 2006, and then during the bust (or post-boom) period extending through 2012 (Cohen et al., 2012). Housing prices peaked in early 2006 after a decade of price increases, and at the end of that year, there was a sudden, unexpected and historic drop in average prices of 18.9%. Home prices continued to fall significantly into 2009, after which prices exhibited more moderate reductions until 2012, when prices began to climb again.==== Changes in housing prices were heterogeneous across the country: housing prices tended to recover and increase much faster in metropolitan areas on the East and West coasts compared to the middle of the nation (Cohen et al., 2012).==== Thus, there is considerable variation in the magnitude of housing price changes across both geography and time. However, while local housing price changes are exogenous to individual households, they are in part driven by local economic conditions that may affect individual health in ways other than through home equity effects. We account for this by incorporating locality and time fixed effects into our econometric model. As a robustness check, we estimate the impact of local housing price changes on both the wealth and use of LTSS by ==== who experienced the same housing market conditions as owners but without experiencing the direct wealth gains or losses.====We confirm in our data the effect of a significant housing wealth expansion from 1994 to 2006. After that we find a housing wealth reduction that is on average a 20–25% drop in net value until 2010. The large and for the most part unexpected changes in housing prices are posited to have an influence on consumers’ decisions regarding the use of LTSS. The analysis shows responses to housing wealth changes in nursing home use as well as formal home health and the likelihood of informal care use.====The structure of the paper is as follows.

It attracted new member states, intensified regional cooperation and deepened the economic and political integration. A number of countries even engaged in a strong permanent commitment introducing the Euro as their common currency. The ongoing integration processes challenge the member states but also the union itself. A central challenge for the future European economic development and prosperity are the changing population age structures of its member states. Over the next decades, they will change significantly with serious consequences for the EU stability. The focus of this paper is to assess the importance of these demographic changes for future European public finances. One could argue that due to diverging demographic destinies the EU could be torn apart as demography reinforces economic differences (Goldstein and Kluge, 2016). Countries with unfavorable age structure for the decades to come, such as Southern or Eastern European countries, already face the biggest economic challenges today. Their rapid aging process will put more pressure on public finances and the future of a joint European endeavor. We use age specific tax and benefit profiles from the National Transfer Accounts project for all EU countries to analyze how the EU countries are affected by aging when they cope with aging themselves versus engaging in a harmonized EU transfer union. For the two scenarios, we estimate country-specific fiscal shortfalls for future decades. This thought experiment is meant to approach the implications of aging for the European Union from a demographic perspective. It is an outlook on different pathways the European Union could take in the future rather than an actual policy advise. In addition, we estimate the net present values of prime age adult intra-EU migrants. We show the impact of changing economic age profiles such as working longer, a promising setscrew (Vogel et al., 2013, Bloom et al., 2011, Börsch-Supan et al., 2014) for the budget of aging countries.====Although, population aging is a common experience of all European Union member states, there are significant differences across the continent. In general, European citizens can expect to live long lives and in western European welfare states, every second girl born today can expect to celebrate her 100th birthday (Christensen et al., 2009). These advancements in longevity together with sub replacement fertility rates in most countries lead to an increase of the elderly population across Europe. Between 2014 and 2050, the share of the EU population aged 15 or younger will decrease from 15,6% to 14,8%, while the share of the elderly (65+) will grow from 18,9% to 28,5% (Eurostat Population Projections). If the improvements in life expectancy continue in the future, Europe will experience a doubling of the share of population aged 80 and older, from 5,3% to 11,1% in the same period. However, population aging proceeds at a very different pace across the 28 EU member states. Fig. 1 shows the old-age dependency ratios for the EU countries in different clusters.==== The graphs show the population in the age group 65 and above in relation to the working age population (ages 15 to 64). In the first panel, we find the old countries. These countries are older than the EU28 average throughout the period of observation. Countries in this category include Germany, Italy, Greece and Portugal and two already older Eastern European countries, Bulgaria and Latvia. Among these countries, fertility fell below replacement level already decades ago and continues to remain low. At the same time, there is variation in life expectancy levels across the EU. Life expectancy at birth is above age 80 for both sexes in the old member states. In contrast, life expectancy is with 74.9 and 74.3 years comparatively lower for Eastern European countries, such as Bulgaria and Latvia. The second panel in the upper right corner shows the old-age dependency ratios for countries that are younger than EU28 average in 2015 but will increase to values above average in 2060. Except for Spain and Cyprus, this cluster includes only rapidly aging Eastern European countries. Here, fertility fell to a lowest low after the Fall of the Iron Curtain in the 1990s and thereafter. At the same time, life expectancy increased, but the gap to the West could not be closed (Mackenbach et al., 2013). The lower left panel shows countries that are and remain younger than the EU28 average. This cluster includes Ireland and the UK, Austria, Luxemburg, Belgium and the Netherlands. The last panel shows countries that are older than the EU28 average today and will be younger in 2060. Here, we find France and the Scandinavian countries. In all lower panel countries, fertility is above 1.5, in some countries it almost nears 2, thus the populations do not age as rapidly as compared to the upper low fertility panel. With more than 80 years, life expectancy at birth is high among these member states.====The graphs show that country specific fertility and mortality trajectories affect member states quite differently. Founding states like Germany and Italy but also countries from the southern enlargement during the 1980s and the new member states that joined the European Union in the 2004 and 2007 enlargements will face increased demographic pressures. It becomes apparent that these are not only the countries with struggling economies today (except Germany) but they will also be the ones to expect the least favorable demographic developments in the coming decades. In addition to their current problems, they are increasingly losing parts of their demographic future by intra-EU migration. This benefits economically successful member states that may alleviate their demographic pressure by attracting migrants in the working ages. A study by Wilson et al. (2013) exemplifies the importance of overall migration for the net replacement rates of cohorts born after 1972 in old and new EU member states. They show that in the majority of countries the number of children born out of a cohort is not enough to replace this cohort.==== However, economically successful western European countries attract young migrants and are able to grow or avoid fast shrinkage despite of sub replacement fertility. The opposite holds true for Eastern European countries. Outmigration decreases their replacement levels below the one that is given by fertility only. These intra-EU migration flows are partially a result of the free movement of labor principle of the European Union. Comparability of education degrees, entitlements to social benefits and anti-discrimination regulations aim at increasing the mobility of EU citizens. They facilitate the outmigration especially of young well educated individuals leaving their economically weak home countries. The age and education component aggravates the situation in the sending country, where mainly the elderly are left behind and government revenues drop while expenditures increase. Higher investment in human capital can absorb the negative growth implications of population aging and with longevity human capital accumulation achieves a higher pays off (Ehrlich and Lui, 1991, Boucekkine et al., 1997, Zhang et al., 2003, Blackburn and Cipriani, 2002, Cuaresma et al., 2014). The problem would be that the older countries invest an increasing share of their public finances into human capital that they then lose to other economically prosperous countries that can harvest the revenues.====Our study is far from being the first to investigate the impact of population aging on public finances. Some scholars advocate the positive long run effects through increasing longevity itself (Ehrlich and Lui, 1991, Barro and Sala-i Martin, 2004) or increased savings and higher investment that can lead to increases in economic growth (Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2000, Chakraborty, 2004, Zhang and Zhang, 2005, Kunze, 2014, de Freitas and Martins, 2014) and demographic dividends (Bloom et al., 2003, Mason and Lee, 2006). Still, there are case studies and cross-country comparisons that stress the demographic challenges and scrutinize national efforts to face them as large transfer deficits arise in the future (Mason et al., 2015). A major focus of the economic literature has been on the impact of population aging on public finances (Fichtner, 2018) and especially social security expenditures. These studies show that the generous welfare provision becomes increasingly unsustainable under current conditions. The major concern regarding older populations are entitlements to higher pension payments (Bongaarts, 2004, Jimeno et al., 2008, Börsch-Supan et al., 2003, Tabata, 2015, Bouchet et al., 2017) or increased demand for health and long-term care spending (Schulz et al., 2004, McGrail et al., 2000, Anderson and Hussey, 2000, Jenkner and Leive, 2010, Breyer et al., 2015, Howdon and Rice, 2018, Murphy et al., 2017). In recent years several EU member states reacted to these alarming outlooks. Reform approaches in the pension system range from automatic balancing mechanisms (Germany, Spain, Sweden) over the prolongation of contribution periods and working lives by linking retirement age to life expectancy developments (e.g. Denmark, the Netherlands or Portugal) to sustainability factors linking benefits to life expectancy (e.g. Finland, France, Poland) (European Commission, 2015). Despite these efforts, there is relatively little focus on the potentials of the EU dealing as a whole with its demographic future. The reluctance of EU member states to give up control over their social policy domains might be a major reason for this. Approaches to deepen social integration are rather spillover effects or driven by the EU institutions.====Our analysis focuses on the costs of aging for the EU member states itself and for a hypothetical transfer union. We consider two sources of imbalances that require thoughtful solutions: 1) migration and 2) the generosity of the country-specific welfare system. The first imbalance arises from the free movement of people across Europe. Individuals can work in a different country than where they where educated or retire. Becker and Murphy (1988) argue that a political equilibrium for intergenerational transfers can be reached in case the state provides free education and at the same time old age pensions. The investments of parents or countries in their offspring would be rewarded by higher pensions. Such an intertemporal intergenerational contract is undermined within the framework of the European Union as member states are due to the free movement of citizens unable to enforce their country-specific intergenerational contracts which can either result in a collapse of the intergenerational contract or an underinvestment in human capital. The second case would be especially harmful for low fertility countries that are especially in need of more productive human capital. Studies find that older individuals are not less productive per se (Börsch-Supan and Weiss, 2013), still this tremendously depends on the investment in human capital made (Lutz and Scherbov, 2004, Prskawetz et al., 2008, Lee and Mason, 2010, Vogel et al., 2015, Cuaresma et al., 2014). In an attempt to become the most productive region in the world as already laid out in the Lisbon Agenda in 2010, cutting human capital investment seems highly unattractive. The second imbalance results from the generosity of the transfer system itself. Many countries provide generous old age, health and long-term care provision that will be on trial with a decreasing number of people in workforce ages. Here, there need to be limits to benefits or an acceptable cooperative agreement otherwise low fertility countries externalize their ageing costs to high fertility countries. This also refers to the moral hazard problem that transfers within EU countries could alleviate pressure to conduct a sound and responsive fiscal policy for selected countries. The limits to benefits and migration to countries providing a high level of social security are of major importance.",Transfers in an aging European Union,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X17300543,May 2019,2019,Research Article,167.0

In most of the countries, this effect has decreased between 2006 and 2014, which means that SES inequalities in mortality are less important in explaining today’s pension wealth inequality. Gini re-centered influence function (RIF) regressions confirm the diminishing influence of tertiary education on pension wealth inequality.","This paper seeks to discuss the distribution of pension wealth in Europe considering inequalities in life expectancy, comparatively and over time. The goal is to describe how pension wealth has evolved over the last years in Europe and to what extent inequalities in mortality affect pension wealth inequality. In a context of rising economic inequality and pension schemes being challenged by rapid ageing, it is important to know which types of pension system are more or less important in determining the level of pension wealth inequality. The comparative analysis offers the possibility to include countries with a different mix of compulsory, voluntary, public and private pension plans, which may enrich the policy discussion.====Pension wealth is roughly defined as the present value of expected pensions and involves the use of discount rates and survival probabilities. Pension wealth is computed for elderly households, with at least one member receiving a pension, in the countries participating in the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC) of 2007 and 2015, which corresponds to the income reference years 2006 and 2014. The sample size for the analysis is composed of 124,486 households observed in 26 countries.====Once pension wealth is estimated for each household, inequality of pension wealth is computed for all the 52 country-year points. The computation of pension wealth and its distribution is performed, first, with mortality estimates but without distinguishing according to socio-economic status (SES), and then with mortality estimates differentiated according to SES, which is captured together with educational attainment. The difference between these results gives an idea about the size of the effect of differential mortality on the distribution of pension wealth. In this paper, SES life tables are estimated for each country, sex, educational group and birth cohort group by utilizing input data from the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital.====The results indicate the important role of life expectancy inequalities on the distribution of pension wealth in some countries (e.g. in Portugal, Cyprus, Greece and Spain), and an almost negligible role in most other countries. It is observed that between 2006 and 2014 the influence of differential mortality on inequality has decreased. Private pension plans tend to increase the inequality of pension wealth, although the effect is small. A further analysis seeks to uncover the effects of some predictors of pension wealth inequality by using ‘Gini re-centered influence function’ (Gini-RIF) regressions. This analysis confirms the diminishing influence of tertiary education on pension wealth inequality in the period of analysis.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section “Studies on pension wealth” reviews the literature dealing with pension wealth estimation, Section “Data and methods==== presents the methodological approach to estimate pension wealth and inequality measures, and Section “Results” presents the results.

The analysis uses health status data from three waves of the Sample Survey of the Aged Population in Urban/Rural China (SSAPUR). To explore the changes, three types of morbidity-free life expectancy (MFLE) are estimated using the Sullivan method. To identify the influencing factors of morbidity, we use regression models that consist of social and economic variables to identify these factors. Our results show that between 2000 and 2010, the prevalence of moderate morbidity based on activities of daily living (ADLs) declined across most age groups; however, the prevalence for instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and severe morbidity both increased, especially in the oldest old age group. Furthermore, the ratio of the MFLE to the total remaining life expectancy suggests the occurrence of a trend toward morbidity expansion. Our regression results suggest that age is the main factor in morbidity and impairment; however, education, health care, income and urbanisation play important roles in reducing the scores for IADLs and the prevalence of ADLs disability. Our findings imply that health care policy should assume a greater focus on ====, especially when people are expected to live longer. The findings also suggest that the government should prepare for the increasing demand for long-term care in the near future.","An ageing population has many implications, ranging from productivity to health to welfare. It is not surprising then that the effect of this trend is not restricted to near relatives but also has significant implications for the government. From a policy perspective, three direct costs are imposed upon the government: pension, health care and long-term care. The health status of the population thus plays a significant role in determining the government’s direct costs.====A significant number of studies have explored health-related issues; most have used activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) as standards for disability. However, other indicators such as chronic disease, mental health and self-assessed health status are also used as indicators of morbidity.====Three theories have been developed to explain mortality and morbidity trends: compression of morbidity, expansion of morbidity and dynamic equilibrium. Compression of morbidity (Fries, 1980, Fries, 2002) suggests that a decline in mortality rate is associated with a smaller improvement in morbidity/disability rate. Expansion of morbidity (Gruenberg, 1977; 2005) refers to an improvement in mortality rate that may be associated with more chronic disease and other health issues (i.e., a longer but less healthy life). Dynamic equilibrium (Manton, 1982) suggests that life expectancy (LE) can be increased with an equivalent increase in health status (Robine et al., 2003, Tu and Chen, 1994). Healthy LE (HLE) and disability-free LE (DFLE) are frequently used to estimate these trends (Solomon et al., 2012, Cai and Lubitz, 2007, Michel and Robine, 2004, Robine and Michel, 2004, Payne, 2015).====The literature shows that different trends can exist across countries and across periods. For example, Fries (1980) argued that the United States would be undergoing a compression of morbidity. Three years later Schneider and Brody (1983) argued that “The evidence that we will review supports quite different conclusions: that the number of very old people is increasing rapidly, that the average period of diminished vigor will probably increase, that chronic diseases will probably occupy a larger proportion of our life span, and that the needs for medical care in later life are likely to increase substantially.” They warned that an optimistic prediction of morbidity compression would lead health care policy in the wrong direction. However, two decades later, David et al. (2014) showed that from 1991 to 2009, disability in the United States was compressed into the period just before death—the DFLE rose, and the disabled LE declined. Overall, this finding suggests that morbidity is being compressed into the period just before death.====More recently, studies have suggested that an expansion of morbidity is occurring. Crimmins and Beltrán-Sánchez (2011) used data from the United States for 1998 to 2006 and found that “empirical findings do not support recent compression of morbidity when morbidity is defined as major disease and mobility functioning loss,” and they showed that at 65 years of age, years with the ability to function had decreased for both men and women from 1998 to 2006 (pp. 75–81). Furthermore, Solomon et al. (2012) estimated the HLE for 187 countries from 1990 to 2010 in the Global Burden of Disease Study. Their results confirmed the expansion of morbidity hypothesis, including the United States, which was the opposite of what had been suggested. In addition, Solomon et al. found that other developed countries such as Australia and Japan are also undergoing an expansion of morbidity (i.e., the proportion of DFLE to LE decreased; pp. 2150–2052).====This contradiction or change in trend is not unusual; other countries have had similar experiences. For example, Yong and Saito (2009) found that morbidity compression occurred in Japan from the mid-1980s until 1995, followed by an expansion of morbidity to 2004, with the oldest old (85 years of age and over) deteriorating faster than their younger cohorts (p. 479). In England, Jagger et al. (2016) (using survey data from 1991 to 2011) concluded that there had been an absolute compression of cognitive impairment, a relative compression of self-perceived health (i.e., an increasing proportion of life spent healthy) and dynamic equilibrium of disability (i.e., less severe disability is increasing, but more severe disability is not) (p. 779).",Changes in the morbidity prevalence and morbidity-free life expectancy of the elderly population in China from 2000 to 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X17300622,May 2019,2019,Research Article,169.0

As many as 388 million such workers lack old age income security by way of a pension system. The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) is the latest contributory, national-level old age pension scheme for unorganized workers, with an entry age of 18–40 years. In other words, all current unorganized workers above the age of 40 are excluded. How could a national pension system viably guarantee equal pension benefits to all current unorganized workers? This paper considers how such a system might work by offering a case study of a non-contributory pension scheme for building and other construction workers in Karnataka State, India. The results indicate that this state-level pension scheme, fully funded by sector-specific receipts, is financially viable and sustainable with high levels of coverage and adequacy. The robustness of these results is shown via sensitivity analyses of discount rates, ","According to the Government of India’s Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008, the “unorganized sector” encompasses small enterprises (with fewer than ten employees and an individual owner) and self-employed workers engaged in the production or sale of goods or services of any kind whatsoever. An “unorganized worker” is a home-based worker, a self-employed worker, a wage worker in the unorganized sector, or a worker in the organized sector who is not covered by the statutory social security benefits. These benefits include life and disability coverage, health and maternity benefits, and old age protection.====The literature on India’s old age pension schemes focuses on the organized workers (World Bank, 2007), unorganized sector workers (Government of India, 2006, Planning Commission, 2012), general government employees (Reserve Bank of India, 2003), defense personnel (Government of India, 2017), and civilians or general public (Narayana, 2014, Narayana, 2015). In general, these studies show that India’s pension schemes are characterized by (i) full coverage for the general government and defense personnel; (ii) higher coverage for organized sector workers; (iii) negligible coverage for unorganized workers with unique income and non-income exclusionary clauses; and (d) non-universality for civilians.====The India Employment Report 2016 (Ghose, 2016) estimates that the unorganized sector comprised about 388 million workers or 88 percent of total workers in 2011–2012. Of these workers, 70 percent were aged 18–40 years, 23 percent were 41–59 years, 4 percent were 60 years and above, and 3 percent were less than 18 years. The adequate provision of statutory social security benefits in general, and old age income security by way of a pension system in particular, to unorganized workers has been a major policy challenge in India. Current needs include (i) a social safety net available to all individuals, regardless of their work history (Agarwal et al., 2016); (ii) attention to the design and capacity of institutions that oversee and maintain pensions, especially where the public-private division of responsibility for provisioning and financing is yet to be decided (Bloom and Eggleston, 2014); and (iii) a viable and sustainable financing of social security systems.====This paper examines whether the sector-specific design and financing of a universal old age pension scheme for India’s unorganized workers could address these needs. The sector chosen is construction, and the target pension beneficiaries are building and other construction workers (BOCW). Officially, the government must notify all building and other construction works and workers, but the workers engaged in these works are unorganized. Welfare schemes (including an old age pension scheme) for these workers are formulated and implemented by state governments through state-level workers’ welfare boards. At present, benefits of the welfare schemes are limited (or lacking) for the registered (or unregistered) workers of the boards. The main source of financing for welfare schemes is the official cess or specific purpose tax on the cost of construction activities within a state. There are specific rules and institutional arrangements for implementation of the pension and other welfare schemes within each state. These features signify the importance of state-specific policies and experiences. However, the need for an old age pension scheme is important and urgent for all the unorganized (that is, both registered and unregistered) BOCW in the country. The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) is the latest national old age pension scheme for unorganized workers; it has an entry age of 18–40 years and defined contributions and benefits.==== But the APY excludes all unorganized workers above the age of 40. In this context, the sector-specific design and financing of an old age pension system assumes special importance if it can ensure equal pension benefits of the APY to all unorganized workers (both registered and unregistered), now and in the future.====This paper focuses on an economic analysis of a financially viable and sustainable old age pension scheme for the entire group of unorganized BOCW (comprising both registered and unregistered workers) in Karnataka State, India. The main objective of this case study is to answer the following policy research questions: (i) What are the available old age pension schemes for unorganized workers, including BOCW? Is there complementarity or substitutability between the pension scheme for BOCW and others? If substitutable, why is a separate old age pension scheme required for BOCW? (ii) How can the current viability and future sustainability of a pension scheme for BOCW be best defined, measured, and assessed? (iii) What are the design parameters for a financially viable and sustainable pension scheme for BOCW? To our knowledge, no evidence-based answers to the above questions exist in India, except for an early study by John (2004) on the sustainability of an old age pension scheme for BOCW in Kerala State.==== This paper seeks to fill this gap.====To answer the above questions, this paper (i) provides a critical review of available pension schemes for unorganized workers; (ii) estimates the size and age profiles of registered and unregistered BOCW; (iii) calculates benchmark pension assets; (iv) calculates the short- and long-term liability of pension coverage for registered and unregistered BOCW; and (iv) determines the financial viability and sustainability of the current pension scheme. Three strategies are explored to reduce the pension liability and pension deficit and to restore financial sustainability with the pension surplus: (i) co-contribution to the APY, (ii) an increase in the discount rate, and (iii) augmentation of the cess collections. There are three databases for the above analyses: (i) the Karnataka Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (KBOCWWB or, in brief, the Board) for data on the registered workers, sources of receipts, and pattern of expenditure; (ii) the National Sample Survey (NSS) 68th Round (2011–2012) on the employment and unemployment situation in India; and (iii) the Census of India (2011). Data from the first database mentioned are unpublished and collected from the administrative sources of the Board.====The main result of this case study shows that the KBOCWWB’s current pension scheme is financially viable in the short run if the pension liability is not adjusted for inflation. The scheme is sustainable over 10–25 years if the annual growth rate of cess collections is above 25 percent, the discount rate is 9 percent or higher, and the contribution of all workers who subscribe to the APY scheme is paid by the Board. Under this sustainability condition, the pension benefits can be extended to all current registered and unregistered BOCW on par with the APY. These results offer useful design parameters for a financially viable and sustainable universal old age pension scheme for all unorganized BOCW in Karnataka State. This approach and its implications are of general relevance and applicability for other states in India and also may be used to formulate a national policy on old age pensions for India’s unorganized workers in general, and unorganized BOCW in particular.====To our knowledge, there are a few sector-specific welfare funds for unorganized workers in India. These include the (i) Mica Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act, 1946; (ii) Limestone and Dolomite Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act, 1972; (iii) Iron Ore, Manganese Ore and Chrome Ore Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act, 1976; (iv) Beedi Workers’ Welfare Fund Act, 1976; and (v) Cine Workers’ Welfare Fund Act, 1981. All these welfare funds are at the national level under the Ministry of Labour and Employment and financed by welfare cess as per the respective cess/fund acts. The major welfare schemes of all the above funds involve health, housing, education, and recreation. Most importantly, no pension scheme for workers is designed and implemented by the above welfare fund. The Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996, is a notable exception because of its specific provisions for the establishment of a Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board at the state level and the introduction of a pension scheme as one of the welfare schemes. Thus, a systematic analysis of pensions for the BOCW in this paper may have useful lessons for other sectors’ unorganized workers if such workers’ associations/welfare boards would like to create a provision and plan a pension scheme in future.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section “Institutional background of the pension scheme” outlines the institutional background and financing of the pension scheme and its comparability with other pension schemes. The size and age profile of the current BOCW are calculated in Section “Number and age profile of BOCW”. Section “Calculation of pension asset and liability” presents the framework, variables, and parameters for a calculation of pension assets and liabilities. Sections “Financial viability of the pension scheme” and “Financial sustainability of the pension scheme” summarize results and analyses of the scheme’s financial viability and sustainability. Conclusions and implications are summarized in Section “Conclusions and implications”.

In doing so, however, they must take into account not only the simultaneous decline in older adults’ ====: mortality risk and overall disease burden. We find that the greatly improved health conditions of recent years translate into lower labour force participation today than in the past, so that although contemporary male workers aged 55–59 have similar health statuses to their earlier counterparts aged 60–64, their patterns of labour force participation are very different. We therefore conclude that, overall, health does not present a barrier to raising the retirement age in Latin America, even in the longer term.","In many countries across the globe, ongoing demographic ageing and lowered retirement ages are straining social security systems (Bongaarts, 2004), propelling legislative proposals to increase system sustainability to the centre of the public policy debate (Wise, 2004, Bloom and McKinnon, 2010, Hurd and Rohwedder, 2011, Mason et al., 2010). Not only do demographic shifts, and in particular, population ageing, negatively affect social security systems, they also threaten fiscal balance and the sustainability of national health programs (Mason et al., 2010, Bloom and McKinnon, 2010). Hence, many nations experiencing demographic change plan to raise the retirement age in the hope of maintaining economic prosperity and sustainability. Predicting the prospective outcomes of such a step, however, requires a thorough understanding of retirement pattern determinants, and estimating the magnitude of ageing-related costs requires attention to developments in older adults’ labour force participation (Wise, 1997, Wise, 2004, Wise, 2010). Yet although existing studies pinpoint key determinants of labour force behaviour and retirement pattern drivers in developed countries (Coile, 2015, Costa, 1998, Burtless and Quinn, 2001, Hurd and Rohwedder, 2011, Wise, 2004), relatively little is known about retirement and health in emerging economies like those of Latin America (de Carvalho Filho, 2008, Cotlear, 2011, Finlay and Fink, 2011). In this paper, we narrow this research gap by exploring labour force participation and health trends in several Latin America countries over the last half century.====Labour force participation decisions among older individuals are strongly affected by the coverage, availability, and generosity of public pension systems, which determine the magnitude and timing of labour market exits (Coile, 2015, Wise, 2010, Hurd and Rohwedder, 2011, McLaughlin and Neumark, 2016). Also important for the retire-or-stay decision are the impact of social security policies and incentives (Profeta, 2002) and perceived wage sufficiency (Coile, 2015, Costa, 1998). Employment potential at older ages is also dependent on health, with health problems an important reason for earlier retirement. Pérez et al. (2006), for example, show that Brazilians in poor health are less likely to participate in the labour force and when they do, their number of weekly working hours tends to be lower.====Not only have health levels among 50-, 60-, and 70-year-old Latin Americans improved in recent years (Murray et al., 2015, United Nations Population Division (UNPD), 2017)====, but most occupations have become less physically demanding (Goos and Manning, 2007, Gordo and Skirbekk, 2013), a combination that could increase older individuals’ potential to work in a range of jobs. Variations in productivity can strongly affect labour market outcomes (Skirbekk, 2008, Ichino et al., 2017). At the same time, pension levels and pension coverage have risen in many countries, making retirement a viable opportunity for a greater share of the population (OECD, 2006, OECD, 2012, Queisser and Whitehouse, 2006). In Latin America specifically, it seems likely that social security system expansion, economic development, and rising income are creating incentives for more workers to leave the labour market earlier (Queiroz, 2017, Queiroz and Souza, 2017, Aguila, 2014). However, studies on the labour supply of older Latin American adults are scarce and focused primarily on individual countries (Aguila, 2014, Contreras et al., 2011, Mesa-Lago and Bertranou, 2016, Nava-Bolaños and Ham-Chande, 2014, Queiroz, 2008, Queiroz, 2017).====Although the declining mortality and improved life expectancy and health observed in many countries today (Palloni and Pinto-Aguirre, 2011, Soares, 2007) would suggest longer working lives and a reduced fiscal impact of population ageing on public pension programs, historically, there has been a long-term decline in the labour force participation of older workers (Costa, 1998, Burtless and Quinn, 2001, Wise, 1997, Wise, 2010). In fact, unlike their antecedents, most workers today are enjoying a long and healthy period of retirement. In Brazil, for example, the retirement duration for males is predicted to double between 1980 and 2025, rising from 5 years (20% of life expectancy) at age 20 in 1980 to 10 years (10% of life expectancy) in 2025 (Queiroz and Ferreira, 2016). Hence, paradoxically, although people are living longer and entering the labour force later because of increasing educational attainment, they are leaving the labour force at younger ages (Wise, 2010).====Unfortunately, however, studies on the health-labour force participation relation from a macro perspective are scarce. The large body of research on the effect of health status on older adults’ labour supply (Pérez et al., 2006, McGarry, 2004, McGarry, 2009, Hagan et al., 2009) tends to approach the retire-or-stay decision from a micro perspective, estimating individual probabilities of working or retiring at one point in time. Within the smaller body of research that adopts a historical or macro perspective, Milligan and Wise (2011) show that, over time, health conditions in different countries are improving as older adult labour force participation declines. In the same vein, Cutler et al. (2013) estimate that, given current estimates of health status in the U.S., the labour supply of adults 60–65 could become substantially (15 percentage points) higher. This issue of the health-labour supply relation, however, needs to be tested in a less developed region; in particular, one currently experiencing important changes in its population age structure.",Trends in health and retirement in Latin America: Are older workers healthy enough to extend their working lives?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212828X17300555,May 2019,2019,Research Article,171.0

We first investigate the relationship between couple members’ cognitive ability and financial responsibility within the household. Our results suggest that differences in the level of cognitive ability play a major role in determining who is the household financial decision-maker, while changes in cognitive ability of both couple members over time only marginally modify such choice. Next, we study changes in financial ","Several global trends contribute to make financial planning at older ages increasingly challenging. Life expectancy is rising and, with it, the need for large savings to finance consumption over a longer horizon and guard against medical expenses. The progressive shift from defined-benefit to defined-contribution pensions has put more investment responsibility onto households. Recent developments in the public and private health insurance landscapes have made the task of selecting the “right” plan more daunting for seniors. In this scenario, cognitive decline that come with age may present a significant threat to older adults’ economic wellbeing. In this paper, we study the extent to which financial responsibility within the household is related to the relative cognitive ability of its members and examine the financial consequences of cognitive aging.====Recent contributions in the economics literature indicate that cognitive measures contribute to explain heterogeneity in retirement wealth and asset holdings across individuals. Better cognitive skills correlate strongly with lifetime savings (Smith et al., 2010), stock market participation (Christelis et al., 2010) and portfolio diversification (Korniotis and Kumar, 2011). Agarwal and Mazumder (2013) observe that consumers with higher cognitive scores, especially math test scores, are significantly less prone to mistakes when using their credit cards or applying for a home equity loan. Agarwal et al. (2009) analyze life-cycle patterns in financial mistakes using a credit card transaction database and document that financial mistakes follow a U-shape pattern over the life course, with inexperience and cognitive decline being associated with poorer decisions at younger and older ages, respectively. This is consistent with the finding of Samanez-Larkin (2013) that risky financial mistakes at older ages are linked to broader network disruption in the brain which underlies losses in fluid cognitive ability. Hsu and Willis (2013) analyze the impact of information about cognitive decline on the choice of who is the household financial decision-maker. They find that a new diagnosis of a memory-related disease significantly increases the odds that the management of finances is turned over to a cognitively intact spouse. Notably, this often happens well after difficulties handling money have already emerged. Building on this literature, we revisit the association of an individual’s cognitive ability with his/her status of household financial decision-maker and examine the extent to which cognitive declines lead to shifts in financial responsibility between couple members.====Neurological studies show that dealing with simple math problems and handling financial matters are among the first skills to be affected by cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Triebel et al. (2009) assess changes in financial capacity over a 1-year period for cognitively healthy individuals, patients with mild cognitive impairment who converted to dementia and patients with mild cognitive impairment who did not become demented. At baseline, they find that healthy individuals have higher financial capacity scores than those with mild cognitive impairment. Also, those who did not convert to dementia have significantly higher financial capacity than those who did. At the 1-year follow-up, cognitively impaired patients who were eventually diagnosed with dementia exhibit substantially more pronounced decline than others in their ability to deal with financial matters and manage financial resources. Hence, signs of deteriorating financial skills may convey important information about an individual’s cognitive health.====Recent research shows that when confronted with complex choice situations—that is, situations where there are various alternatives and their attributes are hard to discern and differentiate—individuals find it difficult to understand key attributes of alternatives and exhibit inadequate capacity to process relevant information and payoffs associated with different options (Bateman et al., 2016, Handel and Kolstad, 2015, Brown et al., 2017). Because of cognitive decline, older adults tend to have greater difficulty in dealing with such decision-making tasks (Keane and Thorp, 2016), while increasingly facing very complex choice sets related to retirement benefits, health care, and health insurance. Yet, the consequences of cognitive decline for actual savings and investment decisions as well as for asset management at older ages have not been fully studied and understood. This is a key research question with important policy implications. In most developed economies, wealth is disproportionately held by older adults who, because of cognitive decline, may be at a greater risk of poor financial decision making as well as of financial exploitation, ranging from thefts and scams to unauthorized access to accounts (Wood and Lichtenberg, 2017). Moreover, as shown by Okonkwo et al. (2008), individuals with mild cognitive impairment are typical not aware of their deteriorating financial skills and this greatly exposes them to financial vulnerability. Additional empirical evidence on the relationship between cognitive decline and household financial holdings and behavior is therefore critical to better evaluate the opportunity of interventions aiming at prolonging the financial independence of the aging population (Ball et al., 2002).====In this paper, we use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine the association between cognition and financial outcomes among older American couples. The wealth of information, available in the HRS, spanning individual physical health (including biomarkers), cognition, household composition and economic situation, allows us to investigate this relationship comprehensively and to take into account multiple confounding factors that may affect it.====Financial decision making is a rather complex process. It typically involves retrieving relevant information from memory, using acquired knowledge and skills, as well as the ability to compare different options and establish what the best course of action might be. As a result, it concerns a wide range of cognitive functions, from working memory and fluid intelligence to crystallized intelligence (McArdle and Woodcock, 1998). The HRS offers an extensive array of cognitive test scores, allowing us to separately examine specific skills and abilities and to identify which ones are more relevant for financial decision making at older ages. Furthermore, exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the HRS and the fact that interviews are conducted with both spouses/partners in a couple household, we are able to study how changes in cognitive health over time affect an individual’s financial responsibility within the couple and a household’s wealth trajectory. Tackling these issues, which have not been jointly considered in previous studies, and doing so exploiting rich and repeated individual-level information constitute the original and major contributions of this paper to the existing literature. For instance, the closest study to ours by Hsu and Willis (2013) focuses on how information about cognitive decline, largely captured by doctor’s diagnosis of memory disease, affects the choice of the household financial decision maker, but not on how an experienced cognitive decline may potentially affect actual financial outcomes.====Our analysis is carried out in two steps. First, we assess the extent to which individuals’ cognitive ability is related to financial responsibility within the household. Specifically, focusing on couple households, we estimate the effect of cognitive ability on the probability of being responsible for the household’s financial decisions and, therefore, being designated as the survey financial respondent. We find compelling evidence that, conditional on a wide range of couple members’ demographics, the cognitive ability of each partner matters in determining who is in charge of the household’s finances. In OLS regressions, a one standard deviation increase in one’s own total cognition score makes an individual 8 percentage points more likely to be the person responsible for the household’s finances. Conversely, a one standard deviation increase in the partner’s total cognition score reduces one’s probability of being in charge of financial matters by 7 percentage points. In fixed-effects regressions, these estimated effects are still present and statistically significant, but considerably smaller in magnitude. This may suggest behavioral inertia, or lack of skills of the person (e.g., a wife) who should take on financial tasks that were traditionally the responsibility of the partner (e.g., her husband) experiencing a cognitive decline, or relatively similar cognitive declines for both partners as they age. These findings offer further insight on the nature of the sizeable cross-sectional correlation between one’s financial responsibility within the household and cognitive ability documented in previous work (Smith et al., 2010). It appears that differences in the level of cognitive ability play a major role in determining who is the household financial decision-maker and that changes in cognitive ability of both couple members over time only marginally affects or modify such choice. Our findings are consistent with those of Hsu and Willis (2013), who estimate a Cox proportional hazard model and find that switching financial responsibility within the household often occurs only after the financial decision maker’s cognition is impaired enough to induce severe difficulty with handling money. Compared to Hsu and Willis (2013), our fixed-effects regressions exploit individual changes in cognitive score and not new memory disease diagnosis by a doctor, which could be interpreted as a stronger sign of cognitive impairment and, hence, more likely to induce behavioral responses.====Second, for each respondent in the panel, we identify a noticeable decline in cognitive ability, defined by a 10%–15% drop in cognitive test scores over two consecutive interviews. We then compare financial wealth of households whose members experience such a cognitive decline to that of households whose members do not experience such a cognitive decline. For those who experience a cognitive decline, we also distinguish between the period of the decline and the period after the decline (households who do not experience a cognitive decline are only observed in the pre-decline period, by construction). This allows us to investigate whether wealth changes following a noticeable cognitive decline fade out, persist or are reinforced over time. We carry out this analysis separately for the sub-samples of financial respondents and non-financial respondents and explore heterogeneity by gender. Compared to households whose members do not experience a cognitive decline, those who suffer a decline bear significant reductions in financial wealth at the time of and after the decline. Such reductions are primarily concentrated among households where the person in charge of financial matters suffers the loss in cognition and more sizeable if the financially responsible person is a woman. These findings are robust to different measures of financial wealth and ways of defining cognitive decline. We find no evidence that the observed reductions in household wealth following a decline in cognitive ability can be, at least partially, attributed to an increase in household medical expenses. The data suggest that, after experiencing a cognitive decline, retirees with pension or annuity income did not bear as much wealth reduction as those who, besides Social Security benefits, rely mostly on distributions from retirement accounts. Finally, our empirical results weakly support the hypothesis that providing cognitively impaired seniors with informal help in dealing with finances (for instance from children and other family members) can effectively guard them against misuse and abuse of their resources, while preserving their financial independence.====As many older adults experience memory loss and, more generally, cognitive decline as part of an aging process, the level of dementia detection is very low. According to the recent meta-analysis by Lang et al. (2017), the prevalence of undetected dementia is estimated at 61% in the U.S. Our paper explores potential implications of this phenomenon in the financial domain. Individuals who experience significant cognitive test score drops over a 4-year period, which are likely to remain undetected, have a low likelihood of being ever diagnosed with cognitive impairment or dementia. Yet, they exhibit detectable changes in financial wealth. At the same time, our study, coupled with the one by Hsu and Willis (2013), reveals that, as long as these individuals remain undiagnosed, they are unlikely to stop assuming financial responsibility, with potential adverse consequences for their economic wellbeing at older ages.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in the study. Section 3 presents the results of the analysis relating cognitive ability to financial responsibility within the household. Section 4 provides evidence of differential household financial wealth trajectories before, at, and after a significant worsening in cognitive health, while Section 5 explores source of heterogeneity and potential mechanisms underlying these findings.
