We also examine ==== effects of EPU of the United States on them. We find that Japanese firms invest less and accumulate more cash when domestic EPU increases. Impacts of subcategories of domestic EPU differs: the uncertainty of fiscal and exchange rate policies are the key drivers of the negative impacts on corporate investment although the predictive power for investment of economic policy uncertainty of exchange rate holds only in the short run. As for the international spillover, we find that economic policy uncertainty in the United States has negative spillover (contagion) effects on corporate investment in Japan. Our findings suggest that Japanese managers become more cautious in making investment decisions as a response not only to higher domestic EPU but also US EPU.","Recent academic studies focus on the link between political factors and multiple aspects of the economy. Policy-related uncertainty is the path through which politics affects firm-level decisions. Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) is an uncertainty measure in politics, which differs from general economic uncertainty. Policy-related uncertainty can drive firm-level decisions in several dimensions, such as capital expenditure, finance, payout, and disclosure policies. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate how EPU affects firm-level decisions.====Japan is a good testing ground to test the currency policy uncertainty and spillover (contagion) effects of EPU in other countries. First, Japan is the third largest and a trade-oriented open economy but does not have a key international currency. These characteristics suggest that businesses in Japan are exposed more to currency policy uncertainties than those in the United States. Second, Japanese firms do not only expose to domestic policy uncertainty but also the U.S. policy uncertainty because of the close linkage between the two countries’ economies. These backgrounds enable us to test the influence of currency policy uncertainty and the EPU spillovers at the firm level.====This study empirically examines the effects of EPU on the investment and cash holding behaviors of Japanese firms. We conduct detailed analyses using subcategories of EPU indices, such as fiscal, monetary, trade, or currency policy. We also investigate the effects of policy uncertainty related to the exchange rate or spillover (contagion) effects from the U.S. EPU. Additionally, we examine the strategic motives of Japanese firms in holding more cash in response to a higher EPU.====Although the key challenge is how to measure EPU, it becomes more popular to use the aggregated policy-induced uncertainty index proposed by Baker, Bloom & Davis (2016). This index allows us to measure how much economic policy uncertainty increases at every point in time. Arbatli, Davis, Ito & Miake (2022), who calculate the Japan's index strictly based on the approach of Baker, Bloom & Davis (2016). Their Japan's EPU index is regarded as the representative EPU index of Japan and formally included in ==== website that compiles representative country EPU indices run by the authors of Baker, Bloom & Davis (2016). A notable feature of Arbatli, Davis, Ito & Miake (2022) is that they also calculate the uncertainty index of subcategories of economic policy: fiscal, monetary, trade, and currency policies. Taking advantage of availability of EPU subcategories for Japan's EPU index, we can provide a more detailed picture of the impacts of economic policy uncertainty.====We find that Japanese firms invest less when the EPU increases. Using the subcategory of EPU, we show that fiscal and currency policy uncertainty are the main drivers of the negative impact on corporate investment. We also find the predictive power of economic policy uncertainty of exchange rate holds for corporate investment only in the short-run (i.e., up to half a year ahead, not a year). Additionally, we find negative spillover effects of economic policy uncertainty in the United States on investment in Japanese firms, suggesting that Japanese managers become more prudent in making investment decisions under higher United States economic policy uncertainty too, reflecting the direct influence of developments in the U.S. economy on the Japanese economy or the global impacts of the U.S. economic policies, or both.====We also shed light on the effects of EPU on corporate cash holdings. We find that Japanese firms hold more cash when the EPU is high. We note that the positive relationship between EPU and cash holdings for Japanese firms holds even after controlling for the effects of investment opportunities. Thus, it is unlikely that an increase in cash holdings is driven by the effects of lower investment opportunities proxied by Tobin's Q. Taken together, our findings suggest that managers become more prudent in making decisions under higher economic policy uncertainty of economy-wide prospects.====One possible concern is the confounding effects of the EPU and macroeconomic uncertainty measures. We also control for several macroeconomic measures, such as VIX in Japan (VXJ). We note that VIX is a widely used measure of uncertainty related to future equity returns. Furthermore, it is often used as a broad economic uncertainty measure from stock investors’ perspectives. We confirm that our main findings are robust even after controlling for the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty.====Previous studies provide evidence that firms tend to decrease investment and cut jobs during periods of high EPU, whereas households tend to reduce consumption (Bernanke, 1983, Bloom, 2009, Gulen and Ion, 2016, Julio and Yook, 2012, Bonaime, Gulen & Ion, 2018, Cao, Li & Liu, 2019)====. These studies primarily focus on the effect of uncertainty on tangible asset investments. We broadly examine corporate investment using several investment measures, including intangible assets and R&D expenditures. We also examine the effects of EPU on cash holdings, which might be a flip side of corporate investment, and investigating the determinants of corporate cash holdings is important, especially because the rising ratio of cash holdings on corporate balance sheets is a common phenomenon in many developed countries in recent years. Taken together, we aim to understand the relationship between cash holdings and investment in response to higher EPU.====This study also contributes to the literature on Japanese firms’ investment and cash holdings. The literature discusses the reasons for the slowdown of investments and the accumulated cash holdings by Japanese firms. For instance, Sakai (2020) investigates the corporate behavior of Japanese firms for the last two decades, the so-called lost decades, since the collapse of the asset bubble in the late 1980s. He finds that Japanese firms face financial constraints in the first decade but not in the second one. He also shows that the lack of investment opportunity can explain the small investment of the firms in the second decade. Masuda (2015) focuses on the impact of monetary policy on corporate investment and shows that contractionary monetary (monetary easing) policy tightens (relaxes) corporate liquidity constraints. Ushijima (2020) shows that firms with diversified business lines hold less cash than firms with focused business lines.====Some preceding studies focus on firms’ behaviors during the global financial crisis in Japan. Uchino (2013) finds that Japanese firms moderate decrease in their investment level during the 2008 financial crisis by substituting their public debt with bank loans. Tsuruta (2019) shows that the adjustment speed of working capital at firms is slower and that the relationships between working capital and firm performance in terms of profit are stronger during the financial crisis than other periods.====Although these preceding studies deepen our understanding of Japanese firms’ financial behaviors, they do not explicitly investigate the impact of economic policy uncertainty. This study provides a new insight into the literature that economic policy uncertainty, not policy per se, works as an important factor affecting firms’ investment and cash holding decisions in Japan, which is not a peculiar phenomenon during a crisis time.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

We develop a search and matching model that features heterogeneous workers with respect to their ages and firm-specific skills. Using the model, we examine the long-run implications of the sharp drop in labor force entry in the 1970s. We show that the changes in the demographic structure induce significant low-frequency movements in per capita consumption growth and thus the real interest rate. The model suggests that aging of the labor force caused the real interest rate to decline by 1 percentage point between 1980 and 2010 in Japan.","Japan’s labor force has been rapidly aging. Since the early 1980s, the average age of its workforce has risen by roughly three years. The ==== of the labor force peaked in the late 1990s. At the same time, the Japanese economy has experienced a prolonged slowdown in growth and persistent declines in the real interest rate. In this paper, we explore a novel causal link between the aging labor force and the low-frequency declining trend in the real interest rate since the 1970s by using a search and matching framework that incorporates heterogeneities in the worker’s age and skill.====The main driver of Japan’s aging workforce is the end of the baby boom. The birth rate fell precipitously in the 1950s, which translated into a similarly sharp drop in labor force entry in the 1970s. We argue that this sharp drop in labor force entry caused low-frequency movements in key macroeconomic variables.==== In our quantitative experiment, we feed the model the exogenous path of the labor force entry that mimics the data. We find that the transition to the new steady state takes more than half a century, and during the transition, the economy exhibits low-frequency fluctuations that are consistent with the behavior of the Japanese economy.====There are two key features in our model. First, the model incorporates the empirical regularity that older workers are more productive than younger workers. In the model, a worker enters the labor force as a young worker with no experience. The worker gains their experience as they become old. Experienced workers enjoy higher productivity. Second, we also incorporate into the model what we believe is the salient feature of the Japanese labor market, namely, the importance of firm-specific skills.==== The (old) worker’s skill associated with their====experience in the labor market tends to be firm specific; therefore, when the worker loses their job, they could lose the productivity premium associated with being an experienced worker. When an old worker indeed loses their experience premium, they need to look for a job in the labor market where young (inexperienced) workers are also looking for their entry-level jobs.====In our model, we abstract away from the consumption/saving heterogeneity of workers with different ages and their employment status by assuming that all sources of incomes are pooled and consumed equally across the existing household members. One may view this assumption as being restrictive, given the motivation of this paper. However, we make this assumption to highlight the key mechanism of our paper, namely, skill (productivity) heterogeneity in the workforce. In our model, the evolution of the demographic structure leads to changes in the aggregate skill mix of the workforce, resulting in low-frequency movements in aggregate labor productivity, per capita consumption, and thus the real interest rate.==== The relationship between consumption/saving heterogeneity and aging has already been studied in the literature, as discussed below. However, this “productivity channel” has so far been largely overlooked. Moreover, adding consumption/saving heterogeneity to our model is likely to only strengthen our results.====We show that the equilibrium transition path of the economy replicates important low-frequency features of the Japanese economy observed between 1970 and 2010. According to the model, the first decade of this 40-year period is characterized by rising per capita consumption, labor productivity, and the real interest rate. This period, however, is followed by a prolonged period of a gradual slowdown of the economy. In the data, average per capita consumption growth and the average real interest rate dropped 1.1 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points, respectively, between the 1980s and the 2000s. On the other hand, our model generates declines in per capita consumption growth and the real interest rate of about 0.5 percentage point and 1 percentage point, respectively, calculated as the peak-to-bottom difference over the 30-year period. The model economy exhibits the low-frequency swing for the following reasons. First, the initial phase is characterized by the environment, where more young workers are gaining experience and thus per capita consumption is growing faster. However, as more workers reach a high productivity state, there is less room to grow further. This together with fewer entry flows of young workers implies a slowdown of per capita growth. In addition, the firm-specific nature of the worker’s skill plays a role of putting a further downward pressure on labor productivity and thus the real interest rate in the latter phase of the transition.",Aging and the real interest rate in Japan: A labor market channel,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158323000175,25 April 2023,2023,Research Article,1.0

In particular, we explore the shared responsibility (SR) criterion, under which both producers and consumers share the responsibility for emissions. Employing the multi-region input-output model to calculate the SR based on the value-added method, we can investigate carbon emissions at both national and sectoral levels. Between 2002–2014, carbon emissions in China and India grew dramatically. SR increased by 157% in China and 116% in India. The main driving force of China's carbon emissions was the rapid growth of its exports, and the main driver of India's carbon emissions was its high carbon-intensive production technologies. Although carbon emissions had a declining trend in the USA and Japan, it could have resulted from cross-border carbon leakage. More than 40% of the five countries’ national carbon emissions under SR were attributed to “electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply”. This overwhelming share was attributable to their large amounts of production and high carbon emission intensity.","Climate change caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a global challenge that is not directly linked to national borders. The United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change considers that global climate change is a common problem but differentiated responsibility should be assigned in proportion to the contributions of each economy. To measure the impact of human activities on climate change, many improvements have been made; however, less has been achieved in the allocation of responsibility. Recently, three methodologies were developed to measure a country's responsibility for emitting GHGs: producer responsibility (PR), consumer responsibility (CR), and shared responsibility (SR).====The PR criterion has been widely adopted in climate policies, although it may enhance cross-border carbon leakage. That is, under the PR criterion, regulations on carbon emissions in one country decrease emissions in that location, but they may increase emissions in other countries. This is typically caused by the relocation of production through foreign direct investment and offshore outsourcing. The CR criterion has been argued in many studies to solve the carbon leakage problem; however, it is difficult to conduct and enforce. SR is an intermediate method that attempts to neutralize the shortcomings of PR and CR. However, the relevant empirical studies are limited.====Against this backdrop, this study aims to explore the SR of the world's five largest carbon emitters (China, the USA, India, Russia, and Japan) in the period of 2002–2014. As total carbon emissions are more than half of the global emissions, these countries have a significant impact on global climate change. Thus, to tackle global warming, analyzing their structure of carbon emissions and driving forces is necessary. In our analysis, we focus on the impact of international trade as a large amount of carbon is embodied in traded products.====Our analysis is based on input-output analysis (IOA), which has been recognized as a useful top-down method for measuring pollution and energy usage during production (Leontief, 1970; Miller and Blair, 2009). Particularly, it has been widely adopted to estimate the GHGs embodied in international trade flows. IOA can be applied in the analysis of national and global carbon emissions through both the single-region input-output (SRIO) and multi-region input-output (MRIO) models.====In the SRIO model, imported goods and services are assumed to be produced using the same technology as domestic products. However, products imported to one country often originate from several countries with different technologies and industry structures. SRIO cannot reflect these differences in the calculation procedure. Conversely, the MRIO model can distinguish among countries and internalize international trade flows into the model (Haukland, 2004; Peters and Hertwich, 2006; Proops et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2022b).====Our results show that for the USA and Japan, CR was higher than PR, implying that they are net carbon importers. The USA's contribution to global carbon emissions kept decreasing under all three criteria during 2002–2014; however, Japan's contribution under CR and SR increased slightly during 2008–2011. Conversely, for China, India, and Russia, PR was higher than CR. Thus, they are net carbon exporters. China and India showed similar trends. In particular, the three aforementioned responsibility criteria, and hence their contribution to GHG emissions, increased dramatically. The SR of China and India increased by 157% and 116%, respectively, in 2002–2014. On factors influencing carbon emissions under SR, international trade volumes as well as economic growth had significant impact on China and the USA. Carbon intensity markedly influenced the SR of India, Russia, and Japan.====We also explore to which countries China and Russia exported carbon and from which countries Japan and the USA imported carbon in 2014. The total emissions embodied in exports (imports) include the direct emissions from producing exported (imported) goods and the indirect emissions from producing intermediate inputs used for the production of exported (imported) goods. Most of the previous studies which examine carbon emissions embodied in international trade consider only a pair or several pairs of countries such as China-Japan (Liu et al., 2010; Long et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2018), China-US (Zhu et al., 2018), China-Brazil (Kim and Tromp, 2021), and Japan-US (Ackerman et al., 2007). Huang et al. (2019) investigate CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports. Although Xu et al. (2021) calculate the world CO2 emission flows, they employ the value-added trade model.====With respect to sectoral SR, we examine 56 sectors listed in the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) for the five countries. The SR of “electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply” is by far the largest. In 2014, more than 40% of the national carbon emissions under the SR criterion came from this sector. Its share is almost 50%, particularly in the USA and Russia. Heavy industries such as “manufacture of basic metals,” “manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products,” and “manufacture of chemicals and chemical products” also accounted for relatively large emissions. For the sectoral SR, the sector's carbon emission intensity, value added, and the amount of production play crucial roles.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the three responsibility criteria: producer, consumer, and shared responsibilities. Section 3 presents our methodology based on the MRIO model. Section 4 presents the results.

Our sample is a large cross-section of over 3000 banks from 71 countries. To address the likely endogeneity of government assistance, we instrument for extra-normal spending using disparities in pre-existing national political characteristics. Our results indicate that bank lending did respond to fiscal capacity, as higher public debt going into the crisis weakened the expansionary effects of higher spending on bank lending at economically and statistically significant levels. Moreover, this sensitivity was higher among weaker banks, suggesting sensitivity to the perceived implications of spending for government assistance going forward. We also found greater sensitivity in high-income economies and for small and medium-sized banks. Our results are robust to a variety of robustness tests, including perturbations in specification, sample, and estimation methodology.","The COVID-19 pandemic raised the need for elevated government spending to fight the pandemic and to stabilize national economies. This resulted in sizable increases in fiscal outlays, and greater liquidly support of households, businesses, and banks. As noted by ====, “The considerable global fiscal support of close to $12 trillion and the extensive rate cuts, liquidity injections, and asset purchases by central banks helped saved lives and livelihoods and prevented a financial catastrophe.”====Notably, at the arrival of the pandemic many national government balance sheets were in challenging positions. As shown in ==== For the pandemic, the initial findings provided a mixed picture on the impact of policy interventions adopted in different countries. As pointed out in a review of ====, there is still a need for more evidence from the detailed bank-level data to understand how banks behave during the crisis, and how the dynamics vary with bank and country characteristics.====Bank profitability and activity has been shown to respond to expected levels of government support. ==== show that bank risk-taking is responsive to perceived implicit and explicit government guarantees.====In this paper, we investigate the impact of national fiscal positions on the efficacy of expansionary fiscal policy to maintain bank lending. The lockdowns in economic activity necessitated by the crisis, as well as disruptions to financial markets during the COVID pandemic, raised concerns that firms would face difficulty maintaining access to credit. While governments pursued extraordinary fiscal expansions to forestall credit declines, the responsiveness of the financial sector may have been sensitive to the perceived capacity of governments to engage in such expansionary policies while maintaining the credibility of their commitments to assist problematic institutions in the event of distress, or even failure. As such, the impact of fiscal expansions on bank activity may vary systematically by national fiscal positions going into the crisis. The COVID-19 crisis provides a useful experience in which to examine the link between fiscal capacity and the impact of fiscal expansion on credit creation, due to the exogenous nature of the COVID crisis that triggered the ensuing fiscal response.====), and in particular may provide information about the willingness or capacity of the government to provide assistance to the banking system in future periods of distress.====Our specification also pays attention to endogeneity concerns, as it is quite possible that countries that experienced more severe COVID responded with both greater lockdowns—which adversely impacted on activity and bank lending–and more assistance spending to alleviate the adverse implications of those lockdowns. In response, we turn to ==== based on the existing national political environment. We use as instruments four political indicators, including indicators of political rights, government effectiveness, the existence of a Presidential system of government, and a measure of the durability of a nation's political regimes. Specification and measurement of these are discussed below, and diagnostic tests reject any weak instrument problem.====We find that while higher government spending was associated weakly with higher commercial bank lending under the pandemic, higher public debt going into the crisis weakened the expansionary effects of higher spending on bank lending at economically and statistically significant levels. Moreover, sensitivity analysis demonstrates that a sub-sample of weaker banks, proxied by higher bad loan shares, exhibited greater sensitivity than their stronger counterparts, although our standard errors are too large for this difference in sensitivity to be established with statistical significance. We also find that the negative relationship between growth in lending by banks and high spending and government debt levels was more pronounced in high-income economies and for the medium and smaller banks in our sample.==== Finally, after accounting for this heterogeneity in sensitivity to extra-normal fiscal expenditures, we find that bank lending growth is increasing in extra-normal fiscal spending, although not always at statistically significant levels. Our results are robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses, including perturbations in specification, sample, and estimation methodology.====A related study by ==== examined the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on global bank lending patterns across countries, accounting for bank characteristics, health systems, regulatory and supervisory practices, bank market structure, credit and bond market development, and borrower heterogeneity. They found that COVID-19 shock was felt more severely by the banks located in countries other than those located in the U.S. We interpret our results as complementary to the literature and suggesting that bank lending responses to government spending under COVID-19 reflected the perceived implications of such spending for government assistance of the banking sector going forward, which was negatively related to the severity of a nation's fiscal challenges.====While our analysis addresses the implications of direct spending, governments also used emergency lending measures to address the crisis. For example, ==== studied the determinants of firms’ use of the business support programs provided by the Japanese government during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that firms were more likely to have obtained subsidized loans the more their sales had fallen during the pandemic. ==== investigate cross-country evidence for five EU countries, Croatia, Finland, Netherlands, Slovakia, and Slovenia. They find that the pandemic led to a significant short-term decline in aggregate productivity and the direct support to firms had only a limited positive effect on productivity developments. ==== analyze national credit-support programs implemented in the context of fiscal policy in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. They conclude that national governments implemented credit-support programs to prevent the massive negative shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns from immediately leading to a crippling wave of corporate insolvencies, and do not appear to have been constrained by fiscal capacity.====Unfortunately, due to data limitations for our large cross-country sample, we cannot control for these government ====. Their omission implies that our indicators of government assistance will be measured with error, which may lead to attenuation in our estimated coefficients for the impact of government assistance policies on bank lending and our interactive term representing the influence of government debt positions on the efficacy of government assistance. However, as long as these errors are not systematically related to the measure of government assistance in our analysis, our results should be unbiased. That seems likely, as in some countries government credit policies probably were used as substitutes for direct assistance, while in others they were introduced in conjunction with direct assistance.====The remainder of this paper is organized into 6 sections. ==== introduces the data set and examines some univariate correlations between the variables of interest in the study. ==== introduces our parametric specification and illustrates our identification strategy. ==== reviews our base specification results. ==== subjects those results to a battery of robustness tests.

However, how governments determine the scale of creative accounting is unknown in the existing literature.====We study whether a difference in the usage and the scale of creative accounting is determined by the intensity of the incentive to issue excessive debt. To study this, we focus on municipal ","Creative accounting, which is defined as “using the flexibility in accounting within the regulatory framework to manage the measurement and presentation of the accounts so that they give primacy to the interests of preparers not the users” (Jones, 2012), has been a considerable problem in the field of governance and has caused serious economic issues for years.==== At the national level, the usage of creative accounting by EU countries when they joined the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is observed (Koen and van den Noord, 2005, von Hagen and Wolff, 2006). In the subnational level, the mayor of Kadoma city in Japan confessed that the city had used creative accounting before their merger negotiation with the other city to hide the deficit of the general account from the citizen of the negotiation counterpart.==== As these several examples show, creative accounting by governments has been observed regardless of its scale. When thinking about the scale of creative accounting, a natural question that arises is how governments determine the amount of creative accounting when they use it. Moreover, what motivates governments to use creative accounting also remains a question in the literature on government creative accounting.====To answer these questions, Milesi-Ferretti (2003) predicts that a different incentive to issue excessive debt will result in a different amount of creative accounting. To verify this, we focus on municipal mergers, a well-known setting that makes debt issuance incentives for municipalities. The literature on the fiscal common pool problem shows that when municipalities merge, municipalities with smaller populations issue more debt since the repayment burden will be shared and will be mainly owed by the larger municipalities when they merge (e.g., Hinnerich, 2009). Therefore, the small merging municipalities have a strong incentive to freeride and issue debt before their merger, while the large merging and nonmerging municipalities do not have this incentive.====In this study, we focus on a creative accounting scheme, the usage of money transfer between accounts. This scheme was available for all municipalities and can gauge the extent of creative accounting and debt issuance for all municipalities (Akai and Ishikawa, 2019). Thus, if a different incentive to issue excessive debt will result in a different amount of creative accounting, the observed amount of creative accounting should be proportional to the population in the merger and be different for whether the municipality is merging. Moreover, since the explicit issuance of excessive debt may result in the breakup of merger negotiation and the loss of the chance to enjoy freeriding, merging municipalities with an incentive to issue excessive debt will use creative accounting to sugarcoat their financial conditions where possible. Therefore, if the amount of creative accounting depends on the incentives of debt issuance, smaller merging municipalities will use creative accounting more intensively due to their stronger incentive for debt issuance than others. This point is an innovation of our paper in that the relative population size is available as a continuous treatment representing the strength of debt issuance incentives, whereas existing papers in the literature focus on binary treatments, leaving what determines the scale of creative accounting unclear.====Fortunately, we can examine this prediction by focusing on Japanese municipal mergers of the 2000s since the mergers there were determined based on negotiation. Moreover, this prediction is also supported by some anecdotal evidence as Kadoma city’s case.====Our main result is that smaller merging municipalities with a stronger debt issuance incentive issue more debt and employ creative accounting more intensively as predicted. The creative accounting scheme we focus on is shifting a deficit from an easy-to-monitor general account to more opaque special accounts, which can be observed by the flow of the net money transfer between the general account and special accounts.==== Our difference-in-difference (DID) analysis exploits heterogeneity in the relative population of municipalities involved in mergers. It shows that the hidden deficit by reducing money transfer and debt issuance was larger for the small merging municipalities.==== Moreover, the municipalities hid approximately one yen of a deficit as they increased one yen of excessive debt issuance on average. In the web appendix, we construct the theoretical model to explain the mechanism of creative accounting in our setting. These results successfully verify the theoretical prediction. Our results are the first evidence to show that governments determined the scale of creative accounting according to their incentives of debt issuance.====To confirm that other factors causing creative accounting in our setting, we examine several hypotheses considered in the extant research. Koen and van den Noord (2005) and Hirota and Yunoue (2022) suggest that governments with poor current fiscal conditions tend to use creative accounting. To investigate this, we check the general account balances of municipalities. The result shows that the current budget balances of small merging municipalities were sound relative to the others in the treatment and pretreatment periods. Different from the previous studies, this result suggests that creative accounting is employed even if the current budget balance is sound.====In addition, we investigate how governments used the money obscured through creative accounting for the first time in this literature. Our dataset enables us to find that the money funded by creative accounting was used not for politicians’ pecuniary gains nor debt repayment but for civil engineering work. Considering that the current budget balances of governments using creative accounting were healthy, this may imply that the creative accounting was used not to overcome financial difficulties but to increase resident welfare.====These findings suggest that governments with a strong incentive to issue debt use creative accounting regardless of their budget conditions and the usage of money. Therefore, to prevent creative accounting, we should be vigilant when governments are incentivized to issue excessive debt even with good financial conditions. Moreover, the introduction of stipulated fiscal rules, which is discussed in the literature, was not a crucial factor of creative accounting in this study since stipulated fiscal rules were practically not binding for municipalities using creative accounting in our setting.====The remainder of the paper consists of six sections. Section 2 overviews the related literature. Section 3 provides institutional backgrounds.==== The hypothesis and prediction are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 explains the identification strategy used and presents the findings of the empirical analysis. Section 6 discusses the results of the empirical analysis.

It is also among the first efforts to distinguish between the role of domestic variables and global trade in transmitting the economic effects of COVID-19. We estimate panel data regressions of the quarterly growth in real GDP on pandemic variables for 90 countries over the period 2020 Q1 through 2021 Q4. We find that readings on the number of COVID-19 deaths had a very small effect in our aggregate sample. On the other hand, changes in the stringency of the lockdown measures taken by governments to restrict the spread of the virus were an important influence on GDP. The economic effects of the pandemic differed between rich and poor countries: COVID-19 deaths exerted a somewhat greater drag on GDP in advanced economies, although this difference was not statistically significant, whereas lockdown restrictions were more injurious to economic activity in emerging and developing economies. In addition to these domestic pandemic effects, global trade represented a significant channel through which the economic effects of the pandemic spilled across national borders. This finding underscores how globalization makes each country vulnerable not only to medical contagion from the COVID-19 pandemic, but to economic contagion as well.","The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the sharpest downturn in the world economy since the Great Depression, with global GDP declining 3.0 percent in 2020 compared to a rise of 2.8 percent in 2019 (====). While it is obvious that COVID-19 was the cause of this downturn, there are critical questions about the channels through which the pandemic depressed economic activity: Was it mainly through lockdowns or voluntary social distancing? How did the economic effects of the pandemic differ among different economies? How large a role was played by the collapse in global trade?====As discussed in ====; ====; ====; ====,====; ====,b) draw on the full range of economic experiences around the world, and, aside from ==== and ====,====), these focus mainly on daily proxies for economic activity—e.g., atmospheric emissions and cellphone-based mobility data—rather than actual production measures.====By contrast, our paper focuses on how the pandemic has influenced the evolution of real GDP growth around the world. Real GDP is available on a quarterly basis. With as many as 8 quarters of data during the pandemic available for 90 countries, this is sufficient to identify the links between the spread of the virus, lockdown measures, and real GDP. Moreover, our data allows us to distinguish the effects on GDP of domestic pandemic variables from those exerted by movements in global trade also caused by COVID-19. Previous studies have not explored this important distinction.====In our paper, we estimate panel data regressions of the quarterly growth in real GDP on several measures of the pandemic for 90 countries over the period of 2020 Q1 through 2021 Q4. The domestic pandemic measures include deaths per 100,000 of the population and a measure of the stringency of lockdown restrictions, the Oxford Stringency Index (OSI). All else equal, a rise in pandemic deaths would be expected to lower GDP, both by inducing supply shortages and by prompting an increase in social distancing that leads production to be scaled back. Similarly, an increase in lockdown restrictions would also be expected to lower GDP. However, both variables could in principle be subject to reverse causality: a shock to GDP that affects the extent of social distancing could lead to changes in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and OSI, biasing the coefficients. Accordingly, we use a two-stage procedure, described below, to address this source of endogeneity.====A central feature of the economic impact of the pandemic was the collapse in world trade. In consequence, even countries that were not hard-hit by the virus itself might have suffered from economic fallout through a decline in export demand. To measure this effect, we include global goods and services imports as an explanatory variable in our model, taking care to exclude from this variable the imports of any individual country in the panel data regression.====The goal of our study is not just to measure the response of GDP growth to its various determinants but also to use those estimates to decompose the overall trajectory of GDP over the course of the first two years of the pandemic into the contributions made by those determinants. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply such an exercise to a direct measure of global economic activity. In so doing, we apply this decomposition both to our complete country sample and, separately, to the countries in the advanced and the emerging/developing economies.====Our basic findings are as follows:====Perhaps the most distinctive finding of our study is the outsized role that global trade has played in the impact of the pandemic on economic activity, especially in the world's poorest countries. This meant that even in countries where COVID-19 numbers were subdued and lockdowns were less restrictive, the hit to GDP in 2020 H1 and the subsequent support for the rebound in 2020 H2 was substantial. The recovery of global trade continued to provide stimulus through most of 2021. Even though the poorest economies lagged the advanced economies in vaccinations, they benefitted from the further recovery of aggregate demand and imports by the advanced economies. Our findings underscore how globalization makes each country vulnerable not only to the medical contagion of the COVID-19 pandemic, but to the economic contagion as well.====The plan of the paper is as follows. ==== reviews past research on this topic, and ==== describes the data used in this project. ==== describes the results of estimating our basic panel regression model, and ==== uses these results to decompose the movements in GDP over the course of 2020 and 2021. ==== concludes.",The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global GDP growth,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158323000138,22 March 2023,2023,Research Article,5.0

Our estimates indicate that the employment rate of married women with children decreased by 3.5 percentage points, while that of those without children decreased by only 0.3 percentage points, implying that increased childcare responsibilities caused a sharp decline in mothers’ employment. Further, mothers who left or lost their jobs appear to have dropped out of the labor force even several months after school reopening. In contrast to women, the employment rate of married men with children was not affected, which hindered progress in narrowing the employment gender gap.","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected labor markets around the world. For example, in April 2020 in the U.S., the pandemic pushed the unemployment rate to a record high of 14.7% and caused millions to leave the workforce, causing the labor force participation rate to decline to 60.2%.====). The literature so far has offered two major explanations for this ‘shecession.’ First, the pandemic decreased the demand for labor in the hospitality and tourism industries in which the female employment share is high. Second, many schools and daycare facilities were closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which increased parents’ childcare responsibilities. Because women typically have more childcare responsibilities than men, the closures were likely to have caused many working mothers to leave their jobs at least temporarily.====The objective of this paper is to estimate the extent to which women’s employment and labor force participation have been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan between April and December in 2020, and how the effects depend on childcare responsibilities. Our approach is to construct a counterfactual outcome such as the employment rate in the absence of the pandemic by modeling labor force status as a linear trend with month effects, and estimating it using pre-pandemic data. We define the disemployment effect of the pandemic as the deviation of the observed employment rate from its counterfactual (or predicted) counterpart.====We find that the employment rate of married women with children, defined by married women who live in a household with children aged 0–15 years, began to decrease in March 2020 when a nation-wide school closure took place and decreased further in April 2020 when the government declared the first COVID-19 state of emergency. Although the government lifted the state of emergency on May 25 and reopened most schools by the beginning of June, the mothers’ employment rate had not recovered even by December 2020. In contrast, the employment rate of married women without children was only modestly affected during the same period in that they were temporarily on leave in April and May during the first state of emergency.====To isolate the effects of increased childcare responsibilities during the pandemic, we compare the disemployment effects of the pandemic between married women with and without gradeschoolers or younger children (aged 0–12 years). These children need more attention and care from adults than teenagers. We find that, in April 2020, the employment rate of married women with children aged 0–12 years decreased by 3.5 percentage points while that of married women without these children decreased by only 0.3 percentage points. Because we control for demographic characteristics and pre-COVID-19 occupation/industry, the difference between the two is explained by childcare responsibilities. Our estimates indicate that the unemployment rate of married women with children aged 0–12 years did not change, but the fraction of those out of labor force increased, which implies that married women with children who left or lost their jobs dropped out of the labor force rather than becoming unemployed.====These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a blow to the momentum reducing the gender employment gap in Japan, which had been narrowing for more than three decades since the ==== Law was enacted in 1985. While the gender gap in the employment rate among those who are married with children was 33 percentage points in 2015 and steadily decreased to about 25 percentage points in 2019, this progress stalled during the pandemic because married men with children were not affected by the pandemic while married women with children were severely affected. The pandemic thus increased the gender employment gap by about 3 percentage points relative to what would have occurred with no pandemic.====We also analyze possible heterogeneous effects of the pandemic across subgroups, and find that the unemployment rate of single mothers rose while their labor force participation rate remained at a similar level, suggesting that single mothers remained in the labor force after a job separation while married mothers left the labor force. This different labor force participation between single and married mothers is likely to be accounted for by non-labor income through their spouses.====Some studies on the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on women in the Japanese labor market. Using data from an ==== survey,==== ==== find more permanent job loss for women than men in late April, 2020, while ====, using the LFS, find that more women aged 25–64 lost employment than men in April and May 2020. Neither of these papers examine the role of increased childcare responsibilities during the pandemic on the labor supply of Japanese women. Further, ==== find that mothers are more likely to work from home than fathers when both parents work, and while they do not estimate the disemployment effect of the pandemic, they show that mothers shoulder the burden of working remotely and caring for children at home.====The strength of our research compared to some other studies that use ==== surveys is our use of the Japanese Labor Force Survey (LFS), a nation-wide survey conducted monthly since 1947 and with a large sample size of about 40,000 randomly chosen households. In addition, we use data from that LFS for the period from the several years prior to COVID-19 through December 2020. This enables us to predict counterfactual outcomes with reasonable precision, based on the previous five years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the employment and labor force participation rates of married women with children have been steadily increasing (====), merely using 2019 outcomes as the comparison would underestimate the effects of the pandemic. We account for the pre-pandemic trend and month effects to address this issue. Second, the LFS has a short panel structure which, unlike ====Our contribution to the literature is to offer another piece of evidence from Japan that increased childcare responsibilities decreased women’s employment and labor force participation rates disproportionately during the pandemic. A growing body of studies is reporting a gender gap in the disemployment effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. ==== find that women’s unemployment in the U.S. increased by 12.8 percentage points between February and April 2020, while that of men increased by a smaller 9.9 percentage points. While some countries did not experience a ‘shecession’ like the U.S,==== (====) find that women’s employment was disproportionately hurt in 18 out of 28 countries, which is different from previous recessions in which men lost more jobs than women. Similarly, ==== also find that two thirds of 38 developed and developing countries suffered a ‘shecession.’ The literature shed some light on the sources of heterogeneity in ‘shesession’ and point to two factors, the difference in industry/occupation structure and the difference in the gender gaps in family responsibilities across countries.====In light of the development of the literature, our findings from Japan provide additional evidence that the gender imbalance in childcare responsibilities widened the gender gap in the labor market effects of COVID-19.==== Although the increase in the unemployment rate due to COVID-19 was limited in Japan compared with other developed countries,==== we find a sharp contrast in the employment responses between men and women with children. This substantial gender gap reflects well the pre-existing gender gap in family responsibilities, measured by the time spent for household chores and child care, in Japan that is the largest among OECD countries, according to ==== and ====), which may have exacerbated the pandemic’s negative effects for women.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section ====, ====, we describe our data from the LFS and present our estimation results.

This potentially served as a good incentive for people to build inexpensive low-rise apartments for tax savings, which increased the number of low-cost apartments. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of inheritance taxation reform on housing rents. Using the difference-in-differences method, we reveal that the inheritance taxation reform decreased the housing rents of wooden or light steel-framed apartments by 1.3%. Moreover, our results indicate that while the rental of slightly older housings belonging to the treatment group decreased, the rental of new housing belonging to the treatment group did not change.","In Japan's inheritance tax system, inheritance through real estate, especially rental housing, is more advantageous than inheritance through financial assets, which leads to measures to reduce inheritance tax through real estate. Therefore, the inheritance tax system significantly impacts the rental housing market in Japan (Seshimo, 2019; Yamazaki, 2019). This study focuses on the effect of Japan's 2015 inheritance taxation reform on the rental housing market and addresses whether the inheritance taxation reform has increased the supply of tax-efficient rental housings leading to a decrease in rents.====Inheritance is a common phenomenon in Japan because Japan has become an aging society, with the percentage of older adults==== as a part of the general population exceeding 28% in 2019 (Statistics Bureau, 2020a). As it is a natural part of life for many, changes in the inheritance policy have a substantial impact.====The inheritance taxation reform of 2015 reduced basic tax exemptions and increased tax rates. It increased the tax base and amount of tax levied. Fig. 1 shows the amount of inheritance tax before and after the 2015 inheritance taxation reform. It indicates the following two aspects: First, people who are not required to pay the inheritance tax before the inheritance taxation reform have to pay the tax. Second, those who have been paying the tax even before the 2015 amendment have to pay increased tax.====In many countries, inheritance taxes were introduced, although their function remained controversial. According to the report by The Government Tax Commission (2000), inheritance tax is based on the successor's ability to pay taxes in the free acquisition of property by the death of their decedent. It is considered complementary to personal income tax and plays a role in the redistribution of wealth by applying a progressive tax rate. The growing debate on wealth and wealth inequality, as represented by Piketty (2014), has focused on the redistributive function of inheritance taxes. In 2012, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, George Soros, and 32 other wealthy people in the U.S. announced a proposal to reduce the basic inheritance tax exemption and increase the applicable tax rate.====However, the assessment of inheritance taxes is not necessarily positive. Several studies show that inheritance taxes affect saving behavior and make taxation less neutral (Chapman et al., 1996; Joulfaian, 2006). Historically, the tax has been abolished in some countries. For example, Australia abolished inheritance tax in 1978 in the interests of efficiency and equity: (1) the proportion of property subject to taxation is small, (2) taxation is concentrated in those industries where the unincorporated firm predominates such as in farming and retailing, and (3) the tax system is regressive. The abolition was used to prevent the outflow of wealthy individuals from leaving the country and to encourage their attraction to the country (Thomson, 1972; Gilding and Glezos, 2014).====In Japan, the basic exemption of inheritance tax was lowered during the bubble period in the late 1980s due to soaring land prices; however, the exemption level remained unchanged through the subsequent period of falling land prices. As a result, the number of taxable cases and the level of taxpayer burden declined compared to the pre-bubble and bubble periods, and the tax redistribution function continued to decline. To restore the redistributive function of the inheritance tax and prevent disparities, the 2015 inheritance taxation reform reduced basic tax exemptions and increased tax rates. It increased the tax base and amount of tax levied.====In this study, we focus on the Japanese inheritance taxation reform in 2015 and investigate the following: (1) Whether people have an incentive to reduce inheritance tax burden by operating low-cost apartments. (2) What is the mechanism behind the inheritance taxation reform that lowers housing rents. We use a difference-in-differences (DID) framework and identify the types of apartment structures that are built after the inheritance taxation reform. Then, we estimate the change in housing rent for the affected group of apartments with subgroups. We find that the rents of low-cost rental housing decreased after the inheritance taxation reform. However, no such effects are evident in the new low-cost apartments.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the literature. Section 3 explains how taxpayers tend to build wooden or light steel-framed housings to reduce their taxes. Section 4 introduces the theoretical model.

We employ an extensive micro-distributed exercise to access otherwise unavailable individual data on firm performance and government subsidies. Our cross-country evidence for five EU countries shows that the pandemic led to a significant short-term decline in aggregate productivity and the direct support to firms had only a limited positive effect on productivity developments. A thorough comparative analysis of the distribution of employment and overall direct subsidies, considering separately also relative firm-level size of support and the probability of being supported, reveals ambiguous cross-country results related to the firm-level productivity and points to the decisive role of other firm characteristics.","The Coronavirus pandemic and related containment measures have led to the deepest disruption in global economic activity since the Second World War. The pandemic has evoked massive government support interventions, unprecedented in scope and scale. Although fiscal support to firms was well justified in order to limit ====, capital disruption and job losses, its longer-term effect on aggregate productivity is unclear. This study adds to the debate by providing comparable firm-level data-based evidence for EU countries along several dimensions. First, we cluster firms according to their pre-pandemic performance to evaluate the allocation of government subsidies to each cluster. We find that the pandemic state aid was distributed rather efficiently, as it supported mainly viable and productive firms in temporary need. Second, we document a large short-term decline in productivity due to the pandemic. Third, we quantify the impact of subsidies on productivity and find that it has only partially offset the large negative shock to productivity. Fourth, the aggregate outcome is largely driven by country-specific factors, including sectoral and size composition of the business sector, as the relationship between productivity and probability of being supported is inconclusive at the firm level.====The subsidies we consider refer predominantly to the first and the most damaging wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although our calculations are based on subsidies provided over the entire year 2020, more granular data shows that subsidies assigned for the period between March and June 2020 represent between 45% to 70% of overall resources allocated in 2020. For Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia we consider solely employment (wage) subsidies, i.e. support received by a firm related to employment contracts kept by the firm even if the work had been suspended. For Finland and Netherlands, we include a broader set of subsidies.====Our analysis adds cross-country empirical evidence to the literature on Covid-19 and productivity. It builds on the early considerations by ====). The pandemic-related uncertainty and lack of financial resources influences capital inputs and investments. As suggested by Calligaris et al. (2021), lower investments may result in a long-term reduction in productivity.====Following ==== we may assume that the pandemic recession accelerates the process of labour reallocation from low to high-productivity firms. However, substantial policy measures implemented to mitigate the Covid shock could potentially reduce productivity-enhancing reallocation. One of the first estimates published by ==== suggests that job reallocation remained connected to firm productivity during the pandemic, i.e. high productivity firms were more likely to expand and low productivity firms were more likely to contract. The pandemic coincided with a temporary strengthening of the reallocation-productivity link in Australia – but a weakening in New Zealand – which appears related to the design of job retention schemes.====The Covid-19 pandemic brings two additional phenomena related to the extensive government support. First, as reported by ==== for the United States, ==== for Netherlands or ==== for Germany, during the crisis, when one would expect higher probability of firm default, countries are experiencing lower numbers of bankruptcies compared to the pre-pandemic period. Second, despite fears and policy suggestions (e.g. ====), we do not observe an immediate increase in Zombie firms. On the public support allocation, ==== find that it was allocated in line with firm productivity in Italy and Germany, while it was found productivity-neutral in France.====Like ====, ====, or ====, we benefit from micro data originating from balance sheets and income statements to compute productivity developments during the pandemic. Our findings challenge some results based on survey data. For example, ==== state that the Covid-19 shock had a stronger impact on small, young and less productive firms, which resorted relatively more to all available support schemes, including furloughs in Spain. ==== employ results of an EU-wide EIB Investment Survey and document that firms with low pre-Covid-19 productivity are significantly more likely to be supported than firms with high productivity and that being an exporter also matters, albeit to a lesser extent. Similarly, studies focusing on Japanese experience, amongst others ====, ==== or ====, find that less productive firms or firm with lower credit scores were more likely to apply for and receive subsidies.====The paper proceeds as follows. ==== describes the data and the methodology.

Indeed, just before the Fed announced its unprecedented intervention into the muni market, spreads of muni over Treasury yields rose in line with the unemployment rate and appeared headed to levels not seen since the Great Depression, when real municipal gross investment plunged 35 percent below 1929 levels. To prevent such a calamity, the Fed created the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) to purchase newly issued, (near) investment-grade state and local government bonds at ratings-based interest rate spreads over the safe OIS benchmark yield. In general, these spreads were initially about 100 basis points above average spreads under more normal market conditions and were later lowered by 50 basis points in August 2020. Despite a modest take-up, our study documents the MLF prevented muni spreads from rising much above those margins (plus a modest 10 basis point fee) and limited the extent to which interest rate spreads could have amplified the impact of the Covid pandemic. To establish the MLF the Fed needed Treasury indemnification against default losses. There were concerns about whether the creation of the MLF could induce moral hazard among borrowers and could undermine the efficiency of the bond market if the facility had lasted too long. Partly for this reason and because the muni market had settled down by yearend 2020, the Treasury terminated the MLF at that time. Future assessments of these downside aspects will help answer the question whether the program's benefits addressed here exceeded its costs.","This paper is organized as follows. ==== provides a brief literature review, while ==== covers key institutional and historical aspects of the muni bond market and the Fed's new MLF. ==== lays out a framework for modeling municipal bond premia and describes the data and variables. ==== discusses the empirical results and counterfactual simulations, and the conclusion provides a broad perspective on our findings.====This appendix reviews the main developments affecting muni spreads, volumes, and issuance in the Great Depression.==== As noted by ====, pp. 110-11), before the Great Crash of 1929, muni bonds were considered very safe (all but two states had Aaa-ratings and all major cities were rated Aaa), and this segment of the overall bond market was large; indeed, the volume of existing muni bonds was nearly the size of outstanding Treasuries and was about 50 percent larger than the amount of outstanding non-railroad corporate bonds, as well as of that of utility bonds and also railroad bonds. In the few weeks immediately following the October 1929 Crash, muni yields fell reflecting their earlier, highly safe reputation.====But by yearend many cities’ financial condition weakened and could not issue bonds nor could they speed up—let alone sustain—their planned capital projects for 1930 as President Hoover had requested (====, p. 111). Muni spreads widened near yearend 1929. In 1930 there had been some recovery in the overall muni market despite defaults by Miami and several municipal entities in Florida. But by late 1931, a number of states and cities were once again unable to issue bonds and began cutting expenditures (====, p. 290-91). Reflected in increases in muni spreads (particularly for lower rated securities), pressures on state and local budgets intensified in 1932, when many municipal governments were downgraded, had difficulty issuing bonds—some turning to bank loans as a substitute, and greatly cut spending (====, pp. 400-09).====To limit further cuts by state and local governments (whose combined expenditures were twice those of the federal government in 1932), Congress authorized the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in mid-1932 to make loans to state and local governments to fund both capital projects and current spending. Nevertheless, conditions worsened in the first half of 1933 with several more state and local governments defaulting (e.g., Arkansas, Detroit, and Cook County (home to Chicago) or being unable to issue debt (particularly Southern states), and many cutting spending (especially on investment) amid further declines in revenues which amplified increases in debt service burdens. Between 1929 and 1933, 33 of the 48 states had seen their bond ratings downgraded.==== In contrast, the federal government was much better able to debt-finance spending. Partly in response, Congress funded transfers from the Roosevelt-run federal government to fund state and local government spending and the RFC greatly expanded lending to fund construction projects, such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Lincoln Tunnel in New York City (====, pp. 511-17).====One lesson from the Great Depression is that distress in the municipal bond market affects the spending of more than just entities that declare default. Indeed, only one state (Arkansas) out of 48 defaulted between 1929 and 1933,==== but many states had cut spending partly in response to being unable to issue municipal debt either at reasonable interest rates and several states sought federal aid to fund their spending (e.g., see ====, pp. 400-09). This is not to say that defaults did not directly result in spending cuts by bankrupt municipalities. There were about 4,800 state and municipal government entities that defaulted on principal or interest payments during the Great Depression (1929-37), including many cities and towns, capital and water-related improvement districts, school districts, and counties as reported by ====, see p. 68 for a tabulation between 1920 and 1939). Nevertheless, the amount of municipal debt affected by defaults in the Great Depression ($2.5 billion cumulative, ==== was a fraction of outstanding municipal debt and of the declines in state and local spending. This too implies that reduced or more costly access of non-defaulting state and local governments to the municipal bond market could induce lower spending.====This appendix provided details on the factors driving several notable defaults by local governments in the last half century and discusses the short-run costs and disruption from these governments adjusting their budgets in a sharp and sudden way.",How the new fed municipal bond facility capped municipal-treasury yield spreads in the Covid-19 recession,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158322000545,24 December 2022,2022,Research Article,9.0

To this end, we employ the so-called expenditure-based approach, which essentially compares the current expenditure of self-employed and wage earner households while controlling for their income, net worth, and household characteristics. Using Japanese household-level panel data for the period 2009−2019, we find that the self-employed possibly underreport their income by 33.0–36.4%. Our findings are also robust to the different preferences (degree of risk-loving, time discount rates, etc.), planned retirement age, and degree of measurement error in expenditure between the self-employed and wage earners.","Tax compliance is key to increasing tax revenue in a country like Japan where government debt has been growing rapidly. It is also important to achieving horizontal equity, i.e., the idea that individuals with similar income and assets should pay the same amount of taxes. In addition, if some households intentionally underreport their income to tax authorities to reduce the tax they pay, inequality measures based on reported income can be misleading.====Despite these concerns, previous studies find that in many countries the self-employed tend to underreport their income to tax authorities, taking advantage of a collection system in which they self-report their income, while the income of most wage earners is reported by third parties (typically the employer). In fact, in Japan the term “Kuroyon” (or “9−6−4”) is frequently used to describe the suspicion that the fraction of income correctly reported to tax authorities is 90% for wage earners, 60% for the self-employed (except farmers), and 40% for farmers====.====To uncover the degree of income underreporting among the self-employed, several approaches have been employed in previous studies. The first approach is the random audits approach taken by Kleven et al. (2011), for example. In their experiment conducted in Denmark, randomly selected taxpayers are thoroughly audited after filing their tax returns. They find that the self-employment income is underreported by about 15.7%. A caveat of this approach is that it can only capture income underreporting that is detectable in tax audits, and the estimates therefore should be considered as a lower bound of true income underreporting====.====The second approach is a randomized control trial. Slemrod et al. (2001), for instance, sent a letter to a treatment group consisting of 1,724 randomly selected Minnesota taxpayers stating that the income tax returns they were about to file would be closely examined, while the control group (consisting of 22,368 individuals) received no such letter. They then compared the changes in reported taxable income from 1993 to 1994 between two groups and found that among low- and middle-income groups the taxable income increased more in the treatment group than in the control group. They also showed that this tendency was more pronounced among those who self-report business or farm income. Their findings imply that the self-employed underreport their taxable income to reduce the tax they have to pay====.====The third approach consists of estimating the ratio of income underreporting by the self-employed based on aggregated data. This approach was widely used in Japan from the 1980s to the early 2000s (see, e.g., Arai, 2007; Hayashi, 1990; Ishi, 1981; Ota et al., 2003). The idea behind this approach is to compare the income of the self-employed in tax statistics, which includes underreported income, with the true income of the self-employed in the System of National Accounts (SNA), which should not be underreported. In order to make this comparison, studies employing this approach calculate the ratio of the income of the self-employed shown in tax statistics to that in the SNA. With a few exceptions, the estimated ratio ranges from around 50% to 80%, implying that the degree of underreporting lies in the range from 20% to 50%. However, this type of estimation suffers from at least two complications. First, since the denominator and the numerator of the estimated ratio are obtained from different statistics (i.e., the SNA and tax statistics), it is difficult to exactly match the coverage and definition of incomes. Second, it is also difficult to estimate the total income of those earning less than the tax exemption limit, whose income is not shown in tax statistics. As a consequence, the estimation results of previous studies appear to be highly dependent on the assumptions used to estimate the total income below the exemption limit. These complications mean that the estimates may have substantial upward or downward bias.====The fourth approach, which is also the one taken in this study, is the so-called expenditure-based approach pioneered by Pissarides and Weber (1989). Relying on the standard life cycle/permanent income hypothesis (LC/PIH), the approach consists of comparing the current expenditure levels of the self-employed and wage earners. More specifically, we regress households current expenditure on a variety of factors that potentially influence current expenditure such as current income, net worth (the sum of the self-reported value of housing wealth and financial wealth less outstanding debt), household characteristics, and preference-related variables. If we find that the self-employed spend more than wage earners even after controlling for the factors, we assume that the only possible explanation for the higher spending of the self-employed is that they underreport their income.====A number of previous studies for a variety of countries employ the expenditure-based approach, all providing evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the self-employed underreport their income. However, the estimated degree of income underreporting among the self-employed varies, ranging from around 10 to 60%, depending on the country, estimation method, definition of self-employed households, and variables used. In their seminal work, Pissarides and Weber (1989) report that in the United Kingdom the self-employed underreport their income by about 36%. Since then, numerous studies following the work of Pissarides and Weber (1989) for a range of countries have been conducted. For instance, Hurst et al. (2014), focusing on the United States, report that the estimated degree of income underreporting among the self-employed is about 25%, while Engstrom and Holmlund (2009) and Engstrom and Hagen (2017) arrive at a range of 16–34% for Sweden, Schuetze (2002) arrives at 11–23% for Canada, Johansson (2005) at 16–40% for Finland, Cabral et al. (2019) at 20% for the U.K., Kukk and Staehr (2014) at 28–62% for Estonia, Martinez-Lopez (2013) at 25% for Spain, Murashov and Ratnikova (2016) at 16–23% for Russia, Besim and Jenkins (2005) at 11–14% for North Cyprus, and Kim et al. (2017) at 28% for South Korea and 29% for Russia.====In this study, we employ the expenditure-based approach using Japanese household-level panel data to investigate to what extent self-employed households underreport their income to Japanese tax authorities. To the best of our knowledge, the only study applying the expenditure-based approach to Japan is that by Tateoka (2016). However, he uses prefecture-level rather than household-level data. Moreover, he does not deal with potential endogeneity, which may lead to an overestimation of the degree to which the self-employed underreport their income. To deal with potential endogeneity issues, we employ instrumental variable (IV) estimation and use the multi-year average of income, taking advantage of the panel structure of the data we employ. We also control for preferences such as the degree of risk loving since the data we employ contain such information. We therefore believe that the present study is the first attempt to examine the degree of income underreporting among the self-employed in Japan in a rigorous manner.====Our study also has an advantage over previous studies applying the expenditure-based approach to other countries. As explained in detail below, the expenditure-based approach unfortunately does not allow us to employ fixed effects estimation even when the dataset has a panel structure, since a key explanatory variable is the self-employment dummy, which for most households is constant over time====. This means that estimation results for the self-employment dummy may simply reflect systematic differences in preferences such as the attitude toward saving. In previous studies, the effects of possible differences in preferences are either ignored or examined via an indirect approach====. In this study, we take advantage of the data we use, which contains responses to a variety of questions regarding respondents’ preferences such as the degree of risk-loving, impatience, and the desire to leave a bequest.====The remainder of the study is organized as follows. The next section explains the institutional background of the Japanese tax system and our estimation strategy. Section 3 introduces the dataset we employ. Section 4 presents our estimation results, and Section 5 examines whether our main results are robust to possible differences between the self-employed and wage earners in their preferences and planned retirement age as well as differences in the measurement error of expenditure between the two groups.

As a result, foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) play a critical role in the Chinese economy, particularly in the export sector, reflecting the international production fragmentation associated with economic globalization. The market size of the host country is also a key attribute for foreign entrepreneurs to operate businesses in China. Numerous FIEs focus on serving the huge and growing Chinese market rather than exports. For example, among FIEs, firms serving only the Chinese market accounted for 38.55% of the total number in 2003.==== Such development suggests that questions regarding the interaction between FIEs and local firms in the Chinese market are critical and worth investigating. A burgeoning literature has examined behaviors of FIEs in China, such as export (Li et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2010) and patenting (Yang et al., 2018). However, analyses of the market power across firms in the Chinese market and the competitive pressure of foreign presence on local firms’ markups in the context of China, are rare in the literature. This inspires the main purpose of this study that examines markups of FIEs and local firms in China by focusing on local-market oriented firms, that is, non-exporting firms.====The pioneering work by Caves (1974) claims that FDI intensifies in competition in the host-country market that a larger share of the market held by FIEs will erode profits earned by local firms, thereby forcing them to set a lower markup. FDI theories summarized by Dunning (1998) also emphasizes that multinational enterprises (MNEs) have specific intangible assets and superior technology, enabling them to overcome disadvantages in the host country and obtain profits. Under the competition pressure brought about by FDI, inefficient local firms are forced to exit the market, whereas surviving firms strive to promote productivity in response to this competition. However, FIEs are thought to outperform local firms in the host country.====Conversely, FIEs suffer legal and non-legal liability of foreignness such as discrimination hazards, relational hazards, and unfamiliarity hazards (Denk et al., 2012). This situation may apply to FIEs that serve the Chinese market. Indeed, a dualist legal regime exists in China in which the legal and regulatory treatments of FIEs are superior than those pertaining to domestic firms (Huang, 2003). However, there is still strong local protectionism favoring local firms, particularly state-owned enterprises (SOEs), that is prevailing across provinces (Young, 2000; Bai et al., 2004). The institutional environment also matters to the exploitation of comparative advantages in FIEs. As China has weak market-supporting institutions, government officials may stand above the law, resulting in the prevalence of corruption and arbitrary interventions in business operations.====Although the conjectures that FIEs have greater market power are intuitively appealing, direct evidence is rare, perhaps because of the difficulty of estimating firms’ market power. To estimate firms’ market power, we revise the methodology developed by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) in calculating markups. Markup, the performance measure, represents a firm's market power and captures the evolution of price and costs in such an operating environment in China. We then relate markups to foreign ownerships to examine whether FIEs have markup premiums in the Chinese market. Furthermore, separating FIEs into those from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (HMT) and from other countries (mainly from Japan, Korea, U.S., and other European members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD), called as non-HMT FIEs, this study investigates the potential difference in markup premium between these two groups. HMT FIEs entered the Chinese market earlier than other countries and are characterized by investment in labor-intensive and lower knowledge-intensive technology, whereas FDI from other countries tend to invest in technology-intensive industries (Wei and Liu, 2006). Meanwhile, as HMT FIEs share a similar language and culture in the so-called great Chinese circle, suggesting that the short cultural distance can affect their performance (Brouthers and Brouthers, 2001). On implementing the preceding analyses, clarifying firm-specific determinants of markups, particularly the roles of technological capability and intangible assets, is also a focus.====Given the unique market and institutional environments in China, FIEs can enter the Chinese market through international joint ventures (IJVs) voluntarily or requested by Chinese government. IJVs may success or fail, depending on not only the selection of local partners (Lu, 1998), but also level of partner commitment, sociocultural distance among partners, product/industry characteristics, and foreign control (Hu and Chen, 1996). Although the “cherry-picking” hypothesis in FDI literature (e.g., Harris and Robinson, 2002, Balsvik and Haller, 2010) suggests that IJVs perform better than the wholly FIEs, it also casts the problem of “lemon-grabbing” risk. Thus, whether IJVs or the wholly FIEs experience higher markups in the Chinese market is an empirical issue, but remains less investigated. The possible difference in markup premiums may exist between wholly FIEs and IJVs and/or between HMT and other FIEs.====FIEs should be aware of the importance of ==== in doing business. Building connections with government officials may enhance their performance in terms of markups because corporates are predominantly coordinated through connection-based mechanisms in China (Li et al., 2009). If the markup premium exists in IJVs, we ask whether building political connection indeed improves markups given that ==== behavior entails costs and risks. For foreign firms, IJVs with state represent a major method of market entry that can help them tap into the local government’ connections to overcome barriers and disadvantages of doing business in China. Thus, examining the possible difference in markup premiums between IJVs with and without political ==== is also important.====Foreign presence could intensify the market competition, while FDI accompanied by technology transfer generates a spillover effect through various channels (Blomströng and Kokko, 1998), thereby improving the productivity and competitiveness of local firms. From an optimistic view, local firms can benefit from the productivity gain that leads them to grow to the point where local production overtakes and forces out FDI (Hu and Jefferson, 2002). Therefore, whether foreign presence dampens local firms’ markups is uncertain. Again, direct evidence on the pre-competitive effect of FDI is rare. When local firms are found to exhibit lower markups and foreign presence to have a negative impact on local firms’ markups, the competitive effect is supported. More crucially, if foreign presence associates with a positive influence on local firms’ markup, their lower markups are probably caused by other determinants of markup. By combining analyses regarding the FIE–local firm markup gap and the markup effect of foreign presence on local firms, our analyses can provide a complete view of the markup effect of FDI.====This paper studies markups of FIEs and local firms in China by focusing on local-market oriented firms, aiming to add value to related literature in the following ways. First, it provides one of first evidence on the relative markups between FIEs and local firms in the Chinese market that is one of the largest single markets. We also examine the differential in markups among FIEs originating from various countries/regions from a cultural perspective, mainly HMT FIEs and non-HMT FIEs. Second, in view of the importance of entry mode on FIEs’ performance, whether IJVs or wholly FIEs exhibit higher markups in the Chinese market is analyzed. Treating HMT FIEs and non-HMT FIEs as heterogeneous firms in establishing and utilizing connections through IJVs in China, we further examine the relative importance of IJVs on markup premium in these two groups. Third, as g==== in doing business is crucial in the Chinese market, the markup effect of ====, through IJVs with local government, for FIEs is examined. Finally, we examine whether foreign presence really reduces the markups of local firms. Combined with the previous analysis of markup gap between FIEs and local firms, this study aims to clarify the competition effect of FDI and other markup-enhancement attributes.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides theoretical discussions regarding (dis)advantages of FIEs and the effect of foreign presence on local firms’ markups. Then, we review the related literature. Section 3 introduces the measurements of markups, data source, and empirical model. Section 4 presents and discusses estimation results on markups, particularly the roles of FIEs, entry modes, and ====. Robustness checks are also implemented. Section 5 examines whether or not foreign presence dampens local firms’ markup.

We find that (1) wages are suppressed in more concentrated labor markets, (2) labor rigidity is associated with wage responsiveness to labor market concentration, (3) the impact of labor market concentration on wages is smaller for firms with more competitive downstream product markets, and (4) greater job opportunities outside the manufacturing sector weaken the relationship between concentration and wages. In sum, our findings indicate that labor rigidity and the degree of competition in downstream product markets, as well as outside options, affect the relationship between market concentration and wages.","The effect of labor market concentration on wages has attracted substantial attention from both economic researchers and policymakers. Many countries have witnessed a persistent decline in the income share of labor, and labor market concentration has been highlighted as a potential explanation for this phenomenon (Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014; IMF, 2017; Autor et al., 2020; Barkai, 2020). Economic theory predicts that if employment is increasingly concentrated among a limited number of firms, employers wield more power during wage negotiations because workers have fewer employment options (Bhaskar et al., 2002; Manning, 2003; Staiger et al. 2010). Imagine a company town where one large firm hires most residents in the area. People cannot easily relocate to take up a better-paying job elsewhere, so they are forced to accept the wages offered by the firm. Consequently, the firm marks down wages, which means that it pays lesser than the wages in competitive equilibrium.==== However, while a rapidly growing number of empirical studies show a negative relationship between labor market concentration and wages, studies so far have not established a clear causal relationship between labor market concentration and wages.====This study empirically examines the impact of labor market concentration on wages through potential changes in labor market power. If the marginal product revenue of labor is constant, a decline in wages implies an increase in markdowns (see Appendix 1.1. for more detail). Labor market concentration is captured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of employment following merger guidelines and existing studies (Azar et al., 2020; Benmelech et al., 2020; Marinescu and Hovenkamp, 2019). Using data from Japan's Census of Manufacture for 2001–2014, we estimate the causal effects of labor market concentration on wages. In practice, the marginal product revenue of labor and wages depends on plant productivity, labor quality, and other variables, and we control for factors that might affect the marginal product revenue of labor, such as labor productivity, plant fixed effects, and labor input characteristics.====We start by estimating standard wage regressions using the employment HHI in labor markets, defined in terms of commuting zones and industry classifications. The estimation was conducted by employing a panel regression with fixed effects. We then investigate the causal effects of labor market concentration using instrumental variables (IV), the average labor market HHI of the same industry in other geographic areas, following Marinescu et al. (2021), Azar et al. (2020), and Schubert et al. (2020). The potential endogeneity problem of the HHI comes from time-varying firm productivity, which affects both wages and labor market concentration. Our IV method works as follows. For example, when demand for Nintendo game consoles soared during the pandemic, this is likely to have led Nintendo plants to hire more workers. This could have made labor markets in the game manufacturing industry more concentrated due to an increase in the employment share of Nintendo. Residuals of local wages after controlling for labor demand are not directly affected by demand shocks in the downstream market because the product demand shock does not affect the productivity of the plants.====The contributions of our study to the literature are fourfold. First, using various models and subsample analyses, we show that labor market concentration suppresses wages. In both the simple fixed-effects model and the IV fixed-effects regressions, we find that an increase in HHI lowers wages.====Second, we find that labor market rigidity relates to the sensitivity of HHI to wages by exploiting the dual structure of the labor market between large and small-to-medium firms and the differences in the labor market over time. The impact of labor market concentration on wages is smaller for large plants compared to small and medium-sized plants. We argue that this result is driven by the labor market rigidity created by the traditional long-term employment system in large plants. In Japan's large firms, workers’ mobility across firms is low - even if wages are lower than marginal productivity. This makes the HHI less sensitive to wages regardless of whether the labor market concentration is high or low. However, in a world with high labor market liquidity, such as that faced by SMEs, wages are more responsive to labor market concentration. Furthermore, we estimate the HHI across four time periods to investigate the role of labor mobility across plants on the relationship between labor market concentration and wages. We take advantage of the fact that labor mobility in Japan has been increasing over time, and use this to investigate the role of labor mobility across firms in effects of labor market concentration on wages. The results indicate that the effects of the HHI on wages are more pronounced in recent years.====Third, we find that the effects of labor market concentration are heterogeneous and depend on the degree of competition in the downstream product markets. Specifically, defining plants engaged in exports as having more competitive downstream markets, we find that the sensitivity of wages to labor market concentration is lower for plants with more competitive downstream markets. These empirical results suggest that firms engaged in exports face stronger pressure to restrain labor costs to survive in competitive downstream markets.====Fourth, labor market concentration has a stronger effect on wages in prefectures with high manufacturing intensity than in those with low manufacturing intensity. In economic areas with a high share of manufacturing in the total economic activity, workers are likely to have fewer opportunities for non-manufacturing jobs. Therefore, in the manufacturing sector, on which this study focuses, the negative relationship between labor market concentration and wages is likely to be stronger in prefectures with higher manufacturing intensity.====Our findings have important implications for the merger and acquisition (M&A) review framework in that they suggest that antitrust authorities should consider the potential effect of M&As on wages. In recent years, antitrust authorities have shown increased interest in competition issues in the labor market.==== However, current merger guidelines of antitrust authorities, such as the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)==== and the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC),==== focus more on the effects on prices in goods and services markets. Reducing labor input costs increases their revenues similarly to raising product prices; thus, firms’ incentives to cut wages in the labor market should also be evaluated.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the development of the hypotheses. Section 3 provides a definition of the HHI and describes the data used for the analysis. Section 4 describes our empirical model and Section 5 presents the results.

With respect to the determinants, we obtain the following three findings: First, firms were more likely to have obtained subsidized loans, grants, or subsidies the more their sales had fallen during the pandemic, suggesting that funds flowed to firms that were adversely affected by the pandemic. Second, the likelihood that firms obtained funds was higher if their credit scores were lower or if they were classified as “zombies” and/or “low-return borrowers” before the pandemic, suggesting that the government programs also helped firms that had been under-performing before the pandemic. Third, firms were more likely to receive funds if they had a stronger relationship with their main bank before, suggesting that bank relationships play an important role in firms’ access to government programs. Regarding the causal effects, we obtain the following three findings: First, except for the subsidies for employment adjustment, the support programs increased the cash holdings of user firms. Second, subsidized loans from private financial institutions lowered exit rates, while none of the programs had a significantly positive effect on employment relative to non-users (or in absolute terms). Third, the credit scores and profit-to-sales ratio of firms that used the support programs decreased and the likelihood of such firms being a zombie and/or a low-return borrower increased. Overall, our findings provide a cautionary tale in that the business support programs produced mixed results in that they may have prevented business failures but have also helped to prop up firms that are not viable in the long run."," In the U.S., for example, the government provided small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with loans on preferable conditions through private sector lenders. In Japan, the government provided subsidized loan programs for SMEs, subsidies for employment adjustment, and other programs to prevent business failures and prevent a rise in unemployment.====While these business support programs likely have reduced business failures and unemployment, there are growing concerns that these programs may be supporting not only firms that were facing temporary liquidity shortages during the pandemic but also firms that are not viable in the long-run and are artificially being kept alive. If this is the case, the business support programs will retard economic restructuring, prevent the efficient allocation of resources, and ultimately lower aggregate productivity.====To examine these issues, this study addresses the following three sets of questions. First, what type of firms were more likely to obtain government support? Were firms that were more adversely affected by the pandemic and as such the main intended targets of the programs more likely to obtain support? Alternatively, have worse-performing firms before the pandemic been more likely to obtain government support? In other words, have so-called “zombie firms” – i.e., firms that were not viable without support from the government or banks before the pandemic – been more likely to obtain support than healthy firms? If so, such programs carry the risk of helping zombie firms to survive and slowing economic restructuring. Second, did programs reduce firm exit and increase employment? This question addresses whether programs achieved their goals of keeping businesses afloat and preventing an increase in unemployment. Third, did surviving firms that received support perform better than those that did not obtain support? Thus, while the first set of questions focuses on the determinants of the use of support, the second and third set of questions are concerned with the effects of support.====To answer these questions, focusing on Japan is useful for the following three reasons. First, the Japanese government provided various large-scale support programs to help firms cope during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, the Japanese economy was already burdened with zombies once in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which has led to serious concerns about a recurrence of the “zombie problem” during the pandemic.==== While in a number of other countries, the presence of zombie firms has become an important policy issue in recent years, especially since the start of the pandemic (see, e.g. ====; ====; ====), Japan still provides the best case study to examine the behavior of zombie firms, since Japan is the only country in which the presence and impact of zombie firms can be traced back for a considerable period. Third, we have rich data from a unique survey on Japanese firms that contain information on the use of each government support program.==== and ==== for zombie firms and ==== for low-return borrowers).====Employing the dataset, we start by conducting logit model estimations to examine what kind of firms were most likely to obtain funds from each support program. The results show that the more a firm's sales fell during the pandemic, the more likely it was to obtain funds from the support programs. This result indicates that firms severely affected by the pandemic were more likely to use the programs. At the same time, firms that had low credit scores before the pandemic were also more likely to obtain funds from the support programs. Moreover, using different criteria for zombie firms and low-return borrowers, we find that both zombies and low-return borrowers were more likely to use the programs. These results indicate that firms that already performed worse and may not have been viable without support from banks before the pandemic obtained funds from the programs. An additional finding is that firms were more likely to obtain funds if they had a stronger relationship with their main bank before the pandemic, suggesting that close relationships with a bank or banks plays an important role in firms’ access to government programs.====Next, to examine the effects of programs on firms’ liquidity position, firm exit, employment, and performance, we conduct propensity-score matching and ==== (PSM-DID) analyses over the period from 2019 (i.e., the year before the pandemic) to 2021 (in the midst of the pandemic). Our results show that, except in the case of subsidies for employment adjustment, firms that used the support programs experienced a larger increase in cash holdings relative to firms that did not use the programs. The results also indicate that the special loan program by private banks led to a lower likelihood of exit for user firms than for non-users, although the other three programs did not. On the other hand, none of the four programs, including the subsidies for employment adjustment, resulted in a significantly better performance in terms of employment among program user firms than among non-users. These results indicate that while the programs achieved the goal of ensuring the survival of firms, they did not have an impact on employment, since employment at non-user firms, like at user firms, remained largely unchanged. As for the performance of surviving firms, the results indicate that, for all programs, program users performed worse than non-users in terms of their credit scores, and for two of the programs (preferential loans from government-affiliated financial institutions and subsidies for employment adjustment), program users performed worse than non-users in terms of their profit-to-sales ratios. Moreover, for all programs, the increase in the likelihood of a firm being a zombie or low-return borrower based on at least one of the four criteria for zombie firms and low-return borrowers we employ was significantly larger for user firms than for non-users. These findings indicate that the programs likely have the serious side effect of leading to a deterioration in surviving firms’ performance at least in the short run, although the long-run effects are yet to be seen.====This study is closely related to the literature assessing COVID-19 business support programs.==== Studies on the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in the U.S. obtain mixed results about its quantitative effects on employment and business survival. For instance, ==== show that many firms used the loans to make non-payroll fixed payments and increased savings. Similarly, ==== find that the effects of the program were small. They showed that employment rates at small businesses (which were eligible for PPP assistance) increased by only 2 percentage points after the PPP was enacted relative to larger firms that were ineligible for PPP, implying a cost of $377,000 per job saved==== On the other hand, ==== show that the receipt of PPP funds increased firms’ subjective survival probability by 20.5%, but only for microbusinesses.====Importantly, many studies on the PPP find that banks played an important role in mediating the use of programs by target firms. ==== find that some funds initially flowed to regions that were less adversely affected by the pandemic and banks’ participation in the PPP was determined by their ex-ante characteristics such as their labor capacity to process loans and whether they had a pre-existing relationship with the Small Business Administration. Similarly, ==== show that although smaller firms were less likely to gain early PPP access, prior lending relationships between small banks and firms attenuated this effect, while ==== show that bank relationships help firms access PPP funds. Finally, ==== show both theoretically and empirically that banks distorted the allocation of PPP funds toward firms with more pre-pandemic debt and those less affected by the COVID-19 crisis.====Some studies assess business support programs other than the PPP. ==== examine the government-guaranteed loans that the German government introduced during the pandemic and show that firms that applied for such loans were more likely to display zombie features before the pandemic.==== In contrast, ==== examine the government support in five EU countries (Croatia, Finland, Netherlands, Slovakia and Slovenia) during the pandemic and find that the pandemic support was distributed only marginally towards zombie and non-viable firms. ==== examine the effects of the UK's COVID-19 support measures on investment planning and employee well-being and find positive effects on both. Further, ==== examine the effects of and responses to the COVID-19 shock for Spanish firms and find that small, young, and less productive firms located in urban areas were more severely affected by the COVID-19 shock and were more likely to use support measures such as public-guaranteed loans, tax deferrals, and assistance to furloughed workers.====As for programs in Japan, ==== conducted a survey on small business managers to understand the effects of the policies introduced at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. ==== evaluated firm exits when a number of policy measures to support business activities were introduced during the pandemic. ==== examined the effects of the three major government support measures on labor costs of Japanese SMEs. ====, using a survey on the use of support programs, finds that firms that had lower productivity before the pandemic were more likely to use such programs. Using a different survey, ==== find that firms that had lower credit scores before the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to apply for and receive subsidies and concessional loans. Further, using ==== criterion of zombie firms, they examine whether zombie firms were more likely to receive support and find no significant difference between zombies and non-zombies. Employing the same survey as this study, ==== find that firms with lower pre-pandemic credit scores and firms that received government-guaranteed loans during the Global Financial Crisis were more likely to apply for the different programs.====In contrast with the above-mentioned studies that mostly examine how government support programs are provided to firms, we not only focus on the determinants of the use of the programs but also examine the impact on firms’ ex-post performance. More specifically, we study the link between firms obtaining funds under the programs and firm exit as well as survivors’ performance and employment. As far as we know, few studies have examined these issues despite their importance given the concern that the programs allow inefficient or non-viable firms to survive.==== It should also be noted that, along with previous studies such as ==== and ====, we focus on the role of banks and use information on the closeness of firm-main bank relationships to examine the role of banks in whether firms obtained program funds.====Further, the paper is related to the literature on the behavior of zombies during the pandemic. Using multiple identification criteria for zombie firms, some recent studies have examined whether the number of zombie firms increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (====). Some other studies examine whether zombie firms were more likely to receive COVID-19 government support than other firms using a single identification criterion for zombies (==== for Germany and ==== for Japan).====Our study, like ====, ====, and ====, employs multiple criteria to identify zombie firms and examines not only if zombie firms are more likely to use government business support programs but also to what extent the ex-post performance of zombies that use these programs changes.====The remainder of the study is structured as follows. ==== provides a brief overview of COVID-related business support programs in Japan. ==== then describes our data, variables, and the empirical methodology, while ==== reports the results. ==== summarizes the findings and concludes.",Determinants and effects of the use of COVID-19 business support programs in Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915832200048X,1 December 2022,2022,Research Article,13.0

The study compares firms with and without credit lines to investigate the effects of credit lines. The empirical results are as follows: (1) Firms with credit lines hold smaller cash reserves than those without; (2) Firms with credit lines undertake more capital investment than those without; (3) The effects of credit lines are more amplified for financially constrained firms than their counterpart; (4) A close bank–firm relationship plays a positive role in the effect of credit lines on corporate activities.====These empirical findings indicate that credit lines can improve firms’ financial flexibility and allow them to use cash holdings held for precautionary reasons to invest. The results also show that credit lines and the attendant implicit bank–firm relationships are complementary to each other. Moreover, having both credit lines and a close bank–firm relationship is important to Japanese firms for their corporate activities. Furthermore, the results imply that the use of credit lines is still relatively undeveloped in Japan, which may be a reason for the country's large corporate savings and lackluster investment.","How do credit lines affect corporate activities in Japan? This study investigates the effect of credit lines on cash holdings and capital investment of Japanese listed firms. A credit line is a preset borrowing limit that enables a firm to borrow from a bank up to the agreed amount under conditions set out in the credit agreement. Although a credit line provides firms with access to funds whenever they require liquidity, firms need to pay a commitment fee to the bank. Credit lines are a popular form of bank loan in the United States. For example, Cagle (1956) reports that approximately 56% of banks provided firms with credit lines. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's ==== states that between 1997 and 2017, credit lines, or “loans under commitment,” accounted for more than 70% of all commercial and industrial loans. In contrast to their counterparts in the United States, firms in Japan did not have access to credit lines until 1999 because of legal restrictions.==== However, in 1999, the “Act on Specified Commitment Line Contracts” came into force, which allowed Japanese firms access to credit lines.====Credit lines provide firms with flexible access to liquidity. As long as firms have access, a credit line is an alternative to cash in firms’ liquidity management. Several empirical studies examine what kind of firms use credit lines and the link between credit lines and corporate activities. For example, analyzing the determinants of credit lines, Sufi (2009) finds that firms with larger cash flows are more likely to have credit lines. In addition, firms with credit lines are less likely to depend on cash holdings than those without credit lines. Similarly, surveying the liquidity management of firms in the United States and Europe during the financial crisis in 2008, Campello et al. (2011, 2012) find a negative association between credit lines and cash holdings. They reveal that a strong link between credit lines and cash holdings in corporate liquidity management. Meanwhile, other studies focus on the effect of credit lines on investment, particularly the drawdown of credit lines. For example, Berrospide and Meisenzahl (2015) investigate the impact of credit lines on capital investment around the time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and figure out a stronger correlation between drawdowns of credit lines and capital investments during the crisis than in normal times. Furthermore, Guney et al. (2017) find that credit lines positively affect the expenditure on research and development (R&D) for firms in 17 European countries. Bolton et al. (2011) theoretically analyze how introducing credit lines change firms’ activities, including cash holdings and capital expenditure. They show that credit lines decrease cash holdings and increase capital investment.====As described above, most studies indicate that credit lines affect corporate cash holdings and investment. However, these studies focus on firms in Western countries. By contrast, studies on credit lines in Japan are limited. This paucity reflects that credit lines remain a relatively new type of bank loan in Japan and that data collection on credit lines is difficult. Moreover, most of these studies examine the effect of credit lines on stock prices. Therefore, the issue of whether and how credit lines affect firms’ cash holdings and capital investment in the case of Japanese firms remains unclear.====Against this background, the present study investigates how credit lines affect corporate cash holdings and capital investment by using a hand-collected data on Japanese listed firms from 2006 to 2017 by comparing firms with and without access to credit lines.====The baseline findings show that credit lines have a negative effect on cash holdings and a positive effect on capital investment. This result indicates that having access to credit lines helps firms lower their cash reserves and undertake more capital investment. Furthermore, the study uses propensity score matching as the baseline results potentially suffer from sample selection bias. The results using this approach also provide evidence of such a link between credit lines on the one hand and cash holdings and capital investment on the other. In other words, the results show that firms with credit lines redeploy precautionary cash holdings for use in capital investment. In addition to estimations using the entire sample, this study also conducts subsample analyses focusing on whether firms are financially constrained (as represented by the firms’ size and payout ratio and whether they have access to the bond or capital market or not) and whether they have a close relationship with a bank. The subsample analyses indicate that the effect of credit lines on cash holdings and capital investment is stronger for potentially financially constrained firms and/or those with a close relationship with their bank.====These findings indicate that credit lines play an important role in corporate activities. However, reverse causality cannot be ruled out. That is, firms that already hold less cash or invest more are more likely to gain access to credit lines. Hence, this study estimates simultaneous equations using three-stage least squares (3SLS). The 3SLS estimation not only helps address reverse causality but also facilitates an understanding of the interactions among cash holdings, capital investment, and credit lines. Consistent with the baseline results, the 3SLS estimation shows that credit lines affect cash holdings and capital investment.====This study contributes to the literature on credit lines in three respects. First, this study is the first to focus on Japan to show that credit lines have an effect on Japanese firms’ cash holdings and capital investment. Another novelty is that the analysis compares firms with and without credit lines, regarding access to credit lines as a discrete variable. By contrast, other studies, mostly focusing on firms in Western countries, use access to credit lines as a continuous variable and examine the effect of the availability and drawdown of credit lines. The reason is that the use of credit lines in most Western countries is already widespread (Cagle, 1956; Sufi, 2009; Campello et al., 2011, 2012).====In contrast to Western countries, the use of credit lines in Japan is still underdeveloped. As explained above, the law permitting firms in Japan, primarily public firms, to legally use credit lines came into force just 22 years ago. Among the sample firms in this study, only a small portion have access to credit lines, and the percentage is much smaller than in the study of Sufi (2009) on US firms. Moreover, the results in this present study indicate that Japanese firms’ availability and drawdowns of credit lines are much lower than those of European and US firms in the studies of Campello et al. (2011, 2012).====In countries where the use of credit lines is much more advanced than in Japan, such as the United States and European countries, many firms have access to credit lines. In addition, their amounts of availability and drawdowns are larger and more heterogeneous than those in Japan. As a result, in such countries, the availability and drawdowns of credit lines are more important for corporate activities than whether firms have access to credit lines in the first place. By contrast, in Japan, where the use of credit lines is relatively undeveloped, very few firms have access to credit lines, and the size of their credit lines is much smaller than that of firms in Western countries. Furthermore, even if Japanese firms have credit lines, most do not use them. Therefore, whether firms have access to credit lines in the first place (a discrete variable) is noteworthy to investigate the effect of credit lines on Japanese firms. This case is something that cannot be examined in studies focusing on Western countries because most firms in these countries already have access to credit lines.==== This contrast between countries with underdeveloped and developed credit lines is one of the contributions of this study. The fact that the use of credit lines is underdeveloped in Japan may also be one of the reasons for the country's large corporate savings and sluggish investment.====The second contribution of this study to the literature is that it estimates simultaneous equations using 3SLS to determine whether the baseline results are robust. This method also allows simultaneous examination of the interplay among credit lines, cash holdings, and capital investment. Although some studies examine the relationships between credit lines and cash holdings or capital investment separately, they do not account for the interaction of these variables. By contrast, the current study examines the relationship between credit lines and cash holdings as well as capital investment simultaneously, which provides a better understanding of how firms manage their liquidity and use it for their activities.====Third, this study highlights the link between credit lines and bank–firm relationships. Firms and banks in Japan often enter into an implicit contract in which banks often hold shares of client firms, and those firms hold shares in each other and/or transfer executives from one to another. Such arrangements enable banks to easily gather information on client firms to strengthen relationships, alleviating information asymmetry. In addition, under such arrangements, banks provide funds to firms even when they are in financial distress. If such implicit bank–firm relationships still operate in Japan, the effect of credit lines for firms with a close relationship might weaken or disappear. However, the findings in this study show that the existence of a close bank–firm relationship strengthens the effect of credit lines and that credit lines and bank–firm relationships complement each other, which means having both is important to boost Japanese firms’ activities.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the use of credit lines in Japan. Section 3 reviews related studies and presents the hypotheses. Next, Section 4 describes the data and empirical strategy, and Section 5 presents the empirical results.

We define a firm engaged in both importing and exporting as a GVC firm. Our analysis is conducted for the period 1994–2018, and it covers approximately 10,000 firms for each year with some variations during the period. We combine the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference in Differences (DID) estimation methods, in order to examine the impact of a shift from non-GVC firm to GVC firm, or participation in GVC by a non-GVC firm, on its productivity. To test the importance of experiences in GVC participation on productivity (learning effect), we estimated the impact not only for the first year of GVC participation but also for subsequent five years. Our analysis showed the impact of GVC participation on productivity is positive for our 110 estimations with few exceptions, and the estimated coefficients are statistically significant for approximately 35 percent of the cases. These findings indicate that the impact of GVC participation on productivity for Japanese manufacturing firms is generally positive, but the impact is not very strong. We also found that the magnitude of positive coefficient increased over time, indicating that it takes GVC participating firms time and experiences to assimilate new technology and management know-how they acquired through GVC participation.","Global value chains (GVCs) have been attracting a lot of attention from many people including policymakers, business people, and researchers as GVCs have steadily become an increasingly important international economic activity and engine of economic growth globally. According to the World Bank (2020), as much as 50% of world trade involves GVCs. GVCs have been constructed by multinational corporations (MNCs), as they fragment production processes into various tasks and base them in various countries/locations where particular tasks can be conducted most efficiently, to achieve efficient production systems, through foreign direct investment (FDI). Specifically, tasks that require labor-intensive operations are located in low-wage countries, while tasks that require high-skilled labor are in countries with abundant high-skilled laborers. GVCs give rise to the active transactions of intermediate inputs produced or processed by different tasks across borders, expanding international trade. A key driver of the expansion of GVCs is a decline in the cost of conducting trade and FDI, which in turn is mainly due to the liberalization of trade and FDI policies, alongside technological progress and deregulation in the transportation and communication services.====Japanese MNCs (hereafter, Japanese firms) have been major participants of GVCs since the mid-1980s. Faced with a sharp appreciation of the Japanese yen in the mid-1980s, Japanese firms began to pursue a fragmentation strategy and locate various tasks in various locations, especially in Northeast and Southeast Asian countries by actively undertaking FDI. These locations provided Japanese firms with a lot of opportunities for the fragmentation of production systems and construction of GVCs, as they comprised countries with different levels of economic development or factor endowment, which is reflected in different wage levels, and as they liberalized trade and FDI policies to attract FDI. Active FDI by Japanese firms led to a sharp increase in the proportion of their overseas sales to parent companies’ sales from 8.7% in 1985 to 38.9% in 2015 before a slight decline to 37.2% in 2019.====Firms participating in GVCs expect to improve their performance. Several reasons may be presented behind such expectations. Participation in trade enables a firm to specialize in activities with a comparative advantage, to result in efficient use of its resources such as labor and capital. Through importing and exporting, a firm may be able to obtain information on superior technology and management know-how from foreign suppliers and buyers, respectively. Additionally, by importing, a firm can use high-quality foreign inputs and extract technology embodied in imported intermediates and capital goods. Through exporting, a firm faces tough competition in foreign markets, forcing them to improve competitiveness for survival. All of these mechanisms or processes associated with trade or GVCs are likely to improve the productivity of GVC participating firms.====This paper aims to examine if GVC participation has improved the productivity of Japanese firms.==== To test this hypothesis, we use the propensity score matching (PSM) method to identify the selection effect (whether high productivity firms can participate in GVCs); and the difference-in-differences (DID) method to examine the learning effect (whether participation in GVCs increases productivity). Simply testing if GVC firms exhibit higher productivity than non-GVC firms does not reveal the impact of GVC participation on productivity, because one may not know if a firm is a new GVC participant or continued participant. Naturally, we are interested in new GVC participants. To identify new participants, one needs to know the GVC status in the previous period. To test the learning effect, one compares productivity of new GVC firms with non-GVC firms with similar characteristics in the previous period. The PSM method is useful in identifying those non-GVC firms, with which GVC firms are appropriately compared for productivity.====In this study a GVC firm is defined as a firm importing and exporting as in earlier studies (Baldwin and Yan, 2014; Del Prete et al., 2017; Reddy et al., 2021; Urata and Baek, 2021; World Bank, 2020) that investigated firm's GVC activities at firm-level. This definition is based on Antràs (2020). Antràs argues that GVC consists of a series of stages involved in producing a product or service that is sold to consumers with each stage adding value, and with at least two stages being produced in different countries and based on this observation he states that when a given firm in a given country both imports and exports, it is natural to conclude that this firm participates in GVC. Although the term “GVC” is not used, there have been studies that analyzed firms with “two-way trade,” that is both exporting and importing. Some of these studies are reviewed in Section 2. It is desirable to incorporate the information on international input-output transaction of a firm to identify a GVC firm, as in the case of industry-level studies using international input-output tables, but unavailability of necessary data precludes us from adopting such methodology.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews studies on the effect of GVC participation on productivity. Section 3 provides descriptive analyses of the sample firms concerning the status of GVC participation and firms’ productivity. Section 4 discusses the methodology and data used for the analysis. Section 5 presents the estimation results and discussions. Lastly, Section 6 concludes the paper.",Impacts of firm's GVC participation on productivity: A case of Japanese firms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158322000417,26 October 2022,2022,Research Article,17.0

We find that aging of the workforce can explain more than 80% of the change in the age–wage profile from 2000 to 2019.","The wage gap between older and younger workers has shrunk dramatically over the past two decades in Japan. The left panel of Fig. 1 shows that the wages of men aged 35–39 and 45–49 were approximately 1.4 and 1.7 times higher than those of men aged 25–29 in the 1990s and 2000s, but in the 2010s they decreased to 1.27 and 1.57 times higher, respectively.==== In other words, the “age–wage profile” has flattened over the last two decades.==== This is an interesting observation in the Japanese labor market; traditionally, both lifetime employment (“Shushin Koyo”) and a seniority-based wage system (“Nenko Chingin”) are considered to be signifying characteristics of the Japanese labor market, in which a worker typically enjoys steady and predictable seniority-based raises from a single employer (Mincer and Higuchi, 1988). However, the data suggest that this tradition may have been either weakened or changed; thus, these days, average workers do not enjoy seniority-based raises as much as previous generations.==== Needless to say, the flattening of the age–wage profile is important for the welfare of individual workers. However, its influence on society extends beyond an individual worker’s welfare. For example, the age–wage profile is one of the key factors for income inequality (Kitao and Yamada, 2019). Also in terms of the government, Braun and Joines (2015), İmrohoroğlu et al. (2016), and Kitao (2018) study the social security system in Japan and use the age–wage (or age–earning) profile to calibrate their model for simulation.====Another, and arguably the most important change in the Japanese labor market is aging. The right panel of Fig. 1 plots labor inputs by different age groups, measured in hours worked. It shows that in the 2000s and earlier, firms hired roughly the same amount of labor services from workers aged 40–44 and workers aged 25–29, but in the 2010s, they hired 70% more labor services from workers aged 40–44 than workers aged 25–29.==== Workers aged 40–44 have become more prominent, or possibly abundant, within firms and in the Japanese labor market. If workers are homogeneous, these demographic changes====should not matter for firms or the economy. However, anecdotally, firms do not view workers that way. For example, Okunishi (2008) reports that approximately 80% of medium-sized firms have some form of age-restriction in hiring. A newspaper article also reported that 10 out of 16 firms that announced voluntary retirement have limited their offer to workers aged 45 or over.==== Many voluntary retirement offers are limited to middle-aged workers. This would be an unnecessary practice if workers were homogeneous.====We think that these two observations, i.e., the flattening of the age–wage profile and the aging of the workforce, are closely connected. Our hypothesis is that firms see workers of different ages as different inputs. They may be good at different tasks; for example, younger workers may be competent at using new technologies, like the information and communications technologies prevalent today, and older workers, with their experience, may be good at leading teams as managers. Perhaps firms operate most effectively when they form a good team that strikes the right balance between youth and experience. If this is the case, the demographic change in the labor market has an important consequence on the age–wage profile. When firms employ a lot of older workers, they have less incentive to hire additional older workers at the same wage as before, and they are willing to pay higher wages to hire scarce younger workers.====This paper formalizes the aforementioned idea of workers as an economic model, and quantifies the impact of aging on the age–wage profile. We begin by modeling the production side of the economy. Importantly, we allow for imperfect substitution between different aged workers. The key parameter of our model is the elasticity of substitution between different aged workers, and we estimate it from the data. Following the literature (Card and Lemieux, 2001, Brunello, 2010), we first apply ordinary least square (OLS) estimation and instrumental variable methods to estimate the elasticity of substitution. However, we find that the results are not robust to the sample period in our data; both the point estimates and the confidence bands change wildly depending on the range of data. As we argue in the paper, this lack of robustness may be due to the omitted variable bias caused by unobserved productivity change such as human capital accumulation in our data. To overcome this issue, we employ the identification strategy of Feenstra (1994), which is free from the omitted variable bias. With this method, we obtain a robust estimate that is not sensitive to the choice of sample period. The estimation result supports the imperfect substitution; the estimated elasticity of substitution is approximately 4.2, which implies that a 1% increase in labor inputs of an age group causes a decrease of 0.24% in their wage.====Our main finding is that aging is the single most important factor that explains the flattening of the age–wage profile. Our argument is based on the model with the estimated parameter. We use the actual labor inputs as the model input, and decompose the change in age-specific wage into the effect of demographics and other factors. We find that the demographic factor can explain a sizeable amount of change in wage after 2000; it accounts for about 80% of the change in wages from 2000 to 2019. The demographic factor was less important before 2000; it accounts for only a third of the change in wages from 1980 to 2000. This result suggests that demographic change, or aging, has a significant impact on the age–wage profile since 2000.====This study contributes to the literature on the flattening of the age–wage profile in Japan. Yamada and Kawaguchi (2015) estimate a Mincer-type wage function to detect the flattening of the experience-wage profile. They argue that this flattening may be caused by the change in demand due to aging of the workforce, but do not show formal evidence or a structural model formalizing their argument. Our study supports their argument with a structural model and empirical evidence. Hamaaki et al. (2012) and Kimura et al. (2019) examine the change in human capital accumulation in Japan and analyze the factors causing it. Both papers capture the human capital accumulation process throughout the age–wage profile controlled by various variables. Our study provides a new perspective on the flattening of the age–wage profile, which enables us to extract changes in human capital accumulation more precisely and further develop this research field.====Our study is also related to the literature on the demographic effect on wage. The negative effect of cohort size on wage is reported by many studies. Welch (1979), Freeman (1979), and Berger, 1985, Berger, 1988 examine a decline in wages for young people when the baby boomers started working in the U.S. Card and Lemieux (2001) studies the effect of changes in the relative supply of highly educated worker in U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Kawaguchi and Mori (2016) also investigate the impact of cohort size on the college wage premium in comparison between Japan and the United States. Brunello (2010), and Moffat and Roth (2016) specify the impact of an aging population in the EU. Several studies quantify the demographic effect on wages in Japan too, but the estimated effects in previous research are either small or not statistically different from zero (Okamura, 2000, Okamura, 2001, Ohta, 2016). Our study finds that this is not the case in recent decades, that is, we also confirm that the cohort size effect on wages is small before 2000, but it has a large effect on wages after 2000. Regarding the elasticity of substitution between workers belonging to different age groups, Noro and Ohtake (2006) report a negative value of elasticity of substitution in each 5-year old group, but it is hard to interpret economically because it implies an upward sloping labor demand curve and a positive effect of cohort size on wage. In contrast, we estimate the elasticity of substitution parameter with an alternative identification strategy, and obtain a result that is both economically meaningful and statistically significant.====Our study is linked to the literature on the Japanese economy. Numerous empirical studies about the change in Japanese employment practices have been published in recent years, such as Kawaguchi and Ueno (2013) and Kambayashi and Kato (2017). One of the fact regarded as the evidence of the change in employment practice is flattening of the age–wage profile (Hamaaki et al., 2012). In contrast, our study shows the new perspective on this literature that the flattening of age–wage profile can be explained by factors different from the change in employment practices. There are also numerous studies that examine the relationship between the extension of mandatory retirement (e.g., Clark and Ogawa, 1992, Mitani, 2003, Yamada, 2010, Kimura et al., 2019, Ueno, 2021). Our study contributes to this literature by showing the specific mechanism of the impact of extending retirement age on age–wage profile. In this regard, the closest work is Ueno (2021), who discusses the impact of changes in age composition caused by the extension of retirement age on the age–wage profile. However, they do not quantitatively assess the impact of change in the age composition of workers. In contrast, our study evaluates the quantitative importance of a specific channel causing the flattening of the age–wage profile by combining the economic model and the data.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the model. Section 3 estimates the elasticity of substitution. Section 4 quantifies the effect of aging on the age–wage profile. Section 5 checks the robustness of our findings. Section 6 presents the conclusions.",The effect of aging on the age–wage profile in Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158322000399,13 September 2022,2022,Research Article,18.0

Using data from the Longitudinal Survey of Newborns in the 21st Century and employing a ====, we found that the reduction of CB payments in higher-earning households, where the annual income of the household head exceeded their threshold, promoted intensive and extensive margins of maternal labor supply, especially for part-time workers and the self-employed. Furthermore, mothers returned to the workplace using non-accredited childcare and increasing the total childcare costs but having no impact on children's health outcomes. Heterogeneous effects were also observed in prefectures with low availability of accredited childcare; mothers incurring CB reduction used non-accredited childcare to start full-time employment. These findings imply that CB reduction had the advantage of encouraging maternal employment and, especially in prefectures with few childcare facilities, increasing the number of accredited childcare centers and that reducing the price of non-accredited childcare services can make it easier for mothers to return to the workforce after giving birth.","Child benefits (CB) are a form of social security provided to parents by the state to cover the economic burden of child-rearing, and many countries currently offer CB in the form of benefits for young children or childcare allowances (OECD, 2019).====The literature has abundant evidence on the policy impacts of CB. For example, numerous studies have examined the direct impact of expanding CB on fertility and child outcomes.==== In addition to the direct impact on recipient households, many studies show, based on income effects, that the expansion of CB discourages parents—especially mothers—from working because CB expansions are expected to have the same effect as exogenous increases in non-labor income (Tamm, 2010; González, 2013; Garganta et al., 2017; Bessho, 2018; Collischon et al., 2020).====Considering fairness and the side-effects of discouraging employment, many countries impose income thresholds or means tests on CB (OECD, 2019). In Japan, the current CB for children under junior high school age comprise a special allowance of JPY 5000 per month per child to households whose annual income for the household head is above the income threshold. However, after October 2022, households with an annual income of JPY 12 million or more for the household head will no longer receive the special monthly benefit of JPY 5000 (The Japan Times, 2020).====However, it remains unclear whether imposing income thresholds or reducing the amount of CB increases employment in high-income households, which are characterized by low female labor force participation and limited access to accredited childcare services.==== Therefore, this study examines whether reductions in CB in Japan increase the intensive and extensive margins of labor supply for mothers, particularly those from relatively high-income households. The study also identifies the employment statuses for which a CB reduction promotes maternal employment and investigates the causal impacts of CB reduction on childcare use and child health outcomes.====In Japan, since the introduction of CB in the early 1970s, payment amounts have been expanded several times based on criteria such as birth order, child's age, and the annual income of high-income earners (hereafter, recipients). Especially between April 2010 and October 2011, the CB were expanded exogenously, following a regime change in Japan. However, since the CB expansion in 2010, which entailed three changes at once—an increase in the monthly allowance, an increase in the eligibility age for the allowance, and the removal of the income threshold—scholars have not been able to estimate the impact of each change separately. Fig. 1 shows the transition of total CB payment from 1971.====Subsequently, to address the government's budget deficit problem, the CB criteria in Japan had another exogenous variation in April 2012, namely, the reintroduction of the income threshold. This policy change reduced the CB to one-third (in case of more than three children or children up to three years old) or half (otherwise) of the previous level if the recipient's income exceeded a predetermined threshold. Considering the exogenous variation of restoration of the income threshold for CB as a quasi-natural experiment, we investigate the effects of the CB reduction on maternal employment and child-related outcomes.====However, it is difficult to estimate the causal impact of CB expansion or reduction on maternal employment because CB is usually endogenously modified based on indicators strongly associated with maternal employment rates, such as fertility and economic conditions. This study uses government statistics that provide an accurate income threshold for each household and employs sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) approaches as the main estimation method.====The main findings can be summarized as follows. Maternal employment increased, although the average decrease in CB was JPY 165,200 (≈ USD 1,502): for the extensive margins, the probability of maternal labor supply increased by 6.89 percentage points (pp) after the CB reduction; for the intensive margins, the weekly working hours of mothers increased by about 2.7 h and the maternal annual earned income increased by JPY 310,400 (≈ USD 2,822).==== These results imply that the additional earned income more than fully compensated for the CB reduction. In terms of magnitude, these estimated values are large enough to be comparable to the average values for the entire population (working probability: 41.6%, weekly working hours: 13.503 hours, annual income: JPY 948,220, respectively). For employment status, we found that the increase in part-time and self-employed workers was proportionate to the decrease in housemakers. For child-related outcomes, mothers’ use of accredited childcare centers did not increase, but the use of non-accredited childcare centers did; consequently, total monthly childcare expenditure increased by 20 pp. Moreover, child health indicators were not affected by the CB reduction.====We also find that among mothers living in prefectures with many children on waiting lists for accredited childcare, the CB reduction decreased the percentage of housemakers and increased the number of full-time employed mothers availing services of non-accredited childcare centers. Thus, the results revealed that, in areas with a potentially high labor supply of mothers, they would work outside the home, especially full-time, even if it means using expensive non-accredited childcare.====Our main contribution to the literature is that we analyze the income effects of CB reduction, instead of CB expansion, on the employment of mothers whose children were two and a half years old and who had not returned to work outside. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of a CB reduction on maternal employment, as existing studies have mostly analyzed the effects of CB expansion on maternal employment (Tamm, 2010; González, 2013; Garganta et al., 2017; Bessho, 2018; Collischon et al., 2020). For example, Bessho (2018) uses a structural estimation method and finds that the 2010 CB expansion in Japan marginally discourages parents from working outside. Since financial resources are not inexhaustible in many countries, it is important to allocate the resources efficiently. It is thus necessary to understand the provision of subsidies and social security is appropriate and additionally that the provision exacerbates the resource allocation as secondary such as discouragement of parent's employment. Thus, we pay attention to how parents' employment is affected by the decline in subsidies or social security. In Japan—where the working population is declining due to an aging society with low birth rates—many studies have attempted to determine the factors that increase the employment rate of women, which is relatively low compared to that of men (Abe, 2013; Asai et al., 2015; Gunji and Miyazaki 2017; Kawaguchi 2019; Kohara and Maity 2021; Nishitateno and Shikata, 2017). For example, regions with adequate childcare services have higher maternal employment rates (Abe, 2013; Asai et al., 2015; Nishitateno and Shikata, 2017). Gunji and Miyazaki (2017) show that key factors explaining the gender difference in the labor wedges are the gender differences in labor productivities, housework, and discrimination. Moreover, Kohara and Maity (2021) show that work-life balance policies encourage married women to increase their time spent in paid employment. Kawaguchi (2019) also finds that the gap in the risk of maternity harassment between regular/non-regular workers can be voluntary resignation and pressure to work overtime. Therefore, this study focuses on reducing CB—a social security benefit—as one of the factors increasing maternal employment and clarifies whether CB reduction increases maternal employment and which employment types are affected (part-time/full-time/self-employed).====We make two additional contributions to the literature. First, we find that the availability of accredited childcare services makes a difference to the impact of CB reduction. Some studies show that CB expansion reduces maternal employment (Tamm, 2010; González, 2013; Garganta et al., 2017; Bessho, 2018; Collischon et al., 2020), whereas others report that the CB expansion encouraged mothers to return to the labor market (Gustafsson and Stafford, 1992; Blau and Tekin, 2007; Bettendorf et al., 2015; Givord and Marbot, 2015). These mixed results could be attributed to differences in the availability of childcare services among countries.==== When mothers cannot access adequate childcare services and must devote much time and resources on child-rearing, they cannot engage in paid employment. Studies show that in some areas of Japan, mothers are relatively more likely to quit their jobs after childbirth and devote themselves to child-rearing because of limited access to accredited childcare services (Yu, 2005; Raymo and Lim, 2011; Steinberg and Nakane, 2012). Compared to the existing studies, we have more information not only on the prefecture in which each household resides but also on the ratio of children on waiting lists for accredited childcare by prefecture. Based on this advantage, we could examine, for the first time, how the availability of accredited childcare differentially affects the impact of CB reductions.====Next, we examine mothers’ responses to CB reduction in cases where the household head—typically their spouse—earns a high income. According to OECD (2019), several countries (e.g., Japan, the United States [Michigan], Canada [Ontario], Spain, and Italy) place income thresholds on subsidies (that include CB) to ensure equity among households. By contrast, many other countries (e.g., France, Germany, and the Netherlands) do not set a threshold for general family benefits. As happened in Japan in FY2012, these countries may be having discussions to establish income thresholds in the future for fiscal reasons. Therefore, our findings add to the literature and inform policymakers by providing evidence on the impact of subsidy reduction on maternal employment.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes Japan's CB policy, and Section III presents our empirical methods. In Section IV, we describe the data, main results, and robustness. Section V discusses the effect of heterogeneity, depending on accredited childcare availability. Finally, we summarize the results in Section VI.",Can child benefit reductions increase maternal employment?

We apply Diamond's (1991) model on the firms’ choice of long- versus short-term debt to the context of SME lending and test a prediction in a manner faithful to the applied model. We find that the ratio of long-term loans decreases with the strength of bank-firm relationships as measured by their duration. This finding is consistent with the prediction and suggest that SMEs take into account the benefit of information production by banks and the cost of liquidation when determining the loan maturity.,"The aim of this paper is to examine the relation between loan maturity structure of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the production of their soft information by banks lending to them. Specifically, we apply the theory of Diamond (1991) on the optimal debt maturity choice by large public firms to SMEs’ choice of loan maturity structure, establish a testable hypothesis on the relation between the maturity structure and the availability of soft information by banks, and empirically test this hypothesis.====The importance of a firm's choice of debt maturity lies in its potential effect on many aspects that go beyond financing that the firm needs, because this choice entails considerable risks and benefits. The literature on the debt structure of firms provides different answers to why firms choose shorter or longer maturities for financing. According to theory, firms prefer to shorten their maturity to take advantage of an improved credit rating (Diamond, 1991) to signal their quality (Flannery, 1986; Kale and Noe, 1990) or to reduce agency costs that are associated with debt (Myers, 1977; Barnea et al., 1980). By contrast, they prefer longer maturities to match the long life of assets in place (Myers, 1977) or to benefit from interest tax shields (Brick and Ravid, 1985).====These theoretical models provide useful insights into understanding the maturity choice of debt. However, they primarily focus on the maturity choice of large public (listed) firms that can issue debt in financial markets. To SMEs that have no or only limited access to the financial markets, it is unclear whether or how these theories are applicable. SMEs cannot raise funds through the markets because they are typically informationally opaque, and instead resort to bank loans. Unlike investors in financial markets, banks are more capable of dealing with the informational wedge that these firms are prone to (see, e.g., Diamond 1984). The literature on relationship lending predicts that banks are able to acquire soft information, that is, qualitative information that is hard to transmit to others. Soft information can reflect the firm's growth potential or the CEO's competence over the course of lending and other relationships, and can mitigate the problems stemming from informational asymmetry (see e.g., Boot 2000; Berger and Udell, 2002). Therefore, examining how the production of soft information affects the mix of long- versus short-term loans for SMEs is important.====To answer this question, we establish and test a hypothesis on the relation between information production and the loan maturity structure by applying the model of Diamond (1991). The primary focus of Diamond's model is on the trade-off for public firms between the benefit in an improved credit rating and the cost of liquidity risk that accompany short-term debt. This model is not directly applicable to SMEs, because they do not have credit rating or access to established financial markets. However, with some changes in the model's setting, we can apply one of the comparative static results in Diamond (1991) to explain the optimal choice of loan maturity structure by banks.====Specifically, Diamond (1991) demonstrates that improved credit rating changes the optimal debt structure of a public firm. By applying the model to explain SME's loan maturity choice, and by remodeling the improvement in the credit rating as improvement in creditworthiness of the SME due to bank’ production of soft information, we can demonstrate that the ratio of the long-term loan decreases as banks produce more soft information about the SME. The intuition behind this prediction is like this. As the creditworthiness improves, a firm can borrow the same amount of long-term loans at a lower interest rate, which enables the firm, ceteris paribus, to promise a larger repayment for the short-term loan. This larger promised repayment enables firms to borrow more short-term loan without enhancing the probability of losing a control right and being liquidated. Without liquidation, short-term loans are always beneficial because the firm can enjoy a decrease in the interest rate if good news arrives when refinancing the short-term loan, so the firm increases the ratio of the short-term loan.====Backed by this theoretical foundation, we empirically test the hypotheses using data on Japanese small businesses. Following many studies on relationship lending (since Petersen and Rajan 1994 and Berger and Udell 1995), our main independent variables are the duration and the exclusivity of the bank-firm relationship as proxies for the accumulation of soft information by the bank through the course of lending relationship. On these variables, we regress the ratio of long-term loans to all loans. For a comparison, we also use the ratio of long-term debt to total debt. In testing the hypothesis, we also distinguish firms that use short-term loans only, because the model predicts that there might be some firms for which short-term loans are costless, and they use them solely regardless of their creditworthiness.====From our analysis, we find that the duration of bank-firm relationships is negatively associated with the ratio of long-term loans, although the exclusive bank-firm relationships is not. The finding on the negative effect of the duration lends support to the hypothesis, and thus to the mechanism that Diamond's (1991) theory predicts. Our results indicate that the production of soft information about SMEs by banks matters when SMEs choose their loan maturity structure.====This study contributes to the literature on firms’ risk and choice of maturity by focusing on SMEs and by incorporating the features that relationship lending possesses. The banking literature has shown that the production of soft information affects the cost and availability of credit, pledged collateral, and even firm value (for a detailed review see Degryse et al., 2009). However, that literature understudies its effect on the maturity of loans, possibly due to the lack of a rigorous theoretical foundation. By applying the model of Diamond (1991), we formally establish and test a well-founded hypothesis.====We are aware of only one empirical study that explicitly conducts a test similar to ours. Using a sample of SMEs from European countries, Hernández-Cánovas and Koëter-Kant (2008) investigate the effect of lending relationships on loan maturity. However, their analysis is not based on a rigorous theoretical foundation. Especially, they neither explicitly discuss a specific mechanism through which stronger lending relationships affect the maturity of loans, nor distinguish firms that use short-term loans only as Diamond's (1991) model suggests. In this sense, ours is the first empirical study backed by a theoretical translation of Diamond's (1991) model to the context of SMEs lending by accounting for special features of the bank-firm relationships.====Our study is also closely related to empirical studies that examine the relation between borrower risk (not information production) and loan maturity of SMEs (e.g., Berger et al., 2005, Ortiz-Molina and Penas 2008 and Kirschenmann and Norden 2012). These works and the present study share the same theoretical foundation of the Diamond's (1991) model. However, our study is different, because we specifically focus on the implication of Diamond's (1991) model on banks production of soft information as measured by proxies for bank-firm relationships, while they focus on the one on riskiness of borrowers in general as measured by proxies such as credit rating and Z-score.==== Berger et al. (2005) and Kirschenmann and Norden (2012) additionally consider the effect of relationship lending, but they only analyze the difference in the effect of riskiness in general depending on the strength of the relationships.====The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: We discuss the literature and develop the hypothesis in Section 2. Section 3 presents the data and the variables. Section 4 outlines our empirical approach. We report the results in Section 5 together with the results from robustness checks.

Our analysis with these methods enables us to estimate the causal impact of the Tokyo Olympics on COVID-19 cases by constructing counterfactual COVID-19 cases for Tokyo (Japan) as the optimal weighted average of COVID-19 cases of ==== countries that are not affected by holding the Olympics through a data-driven approach. Based on reliable estimates obtained from different analytical settings, we find that, compared to the counterfactuals, holding the Tokyo Olympics significantly increased the daily average number of COVID-19 cases by 105 to 132 cases in Tokyo (47 to 65 cases in Japan as a whole) per million people. This result suggests that holding the Olympics likely led to the spread of COVID-19 infection in Tokyo (Japan).","The Tokyo Olympic games, which were delayed for a year due to the global spread of COVID-19, were held from July 23 to August 8, 2021. Unlike normal Olympic games, all events were held without spectators in and around the host city of Tokyo because COVID-19 infection entered an expansion phase in Tokyo in early July. Whether the Olympics should have been held or cancelled while the COVID-19 pandemic was not yet under control was actively debated in many quarters, including the National Diet, academic societies, TV, newspapers, and social networking sites. In general, there was much skepticism about the safety of holding the Olympics. For example, according to a poll conducted by Asahi ==== on July 17 and 18, 33% of respondents were in favor of holding the Olympics, while 55% were against. In the same survey, 21% of respondents said that a “safe and secure Olympics” could be achieved, while 68% said they could not.====The aim of this paper is to answer these questions by estimating the causal impact of holding the Tokyo Olympics on newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tokyo (Japan) using a novel causal inference approach. To estimate this impact, we need to know the unobserved counterfactual COVID-19 cases; that is, what would have been the cases if the Olympics had not been held. To do so, we use a synthetic control method (SCM) proposed by ====, ====) and a Ridge Augmented SCM (RASCM) developed by ====. These methods allow us to estimate the causal impact of an event on its outcome for a single treatment unit by constructing a counterfactual so-called “synthetic control” (SC), which can be constructed from outcomes in the control units through a data-driven approach (====, ====; ====; ====).==== Following ==== and ====We find that holding the Tokyo Olympics significantly increased the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tokyo. This finding is qualitatively robust to varying pre-treatment windows, measurements of outcomes, and different SCMs. The quantitative impacts are slightly different for each analytical setting. When looking at the daily average of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases per one million people from July 23 to August 22, the Olympics increased COVID-19 cases by 105 to 132 in Tokyo (47 to 65 in Japan) relative to the counterfactuals. Based on these estimates and the population of Tokyo (Japan), our results suggest that if the Olympics had not been held, the daily average of new COVID-19 cases could have been reduced by as many as approximately 1500 to 1850 cases in Tokyo (approximately 5900 to 8150 cases in Japan as a whole). These results suggest that holding the Tokyo Olympics likely led to the spread of COVID-19 infection in Tokyo (Japan).",Quantifying the impact of the Tokyo Olympics on COVID-19 cases using synthetic control methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158322000375,15 August 2022,2022,Research Article,21.0

This paper contributes additional evidence that this trend is also occurring with skills that accumulate through job experience. We use micro data of Japanese workers to analyze this phenomenon by taking advantage of unique Japanese employment practices that emphasize skills acquired through tenure and on-the-job training as important human capital. We find that (1) wage returns to job experience have significantly decreased from the 2000s to the 2010s and (2) decomposing the human capital into general and firm-specific, the returns to the latter have decreased significantly.","A huge amount of attention among economists has been paid to the association between workers’ skills and wages over recent decades. One of the most prominent observations among the studies is that the complementarity between technological change and highly-skilled labor led to a growing demand for skills since the 1970s; skill-biased technological change (SBTC) (Katz and Murphy, 1992; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011, etc.).====However, recent studies observe there has been a change in this trend since the 2000s: the demand and thus returns to skills that are at the upper tail of distribution have turned to decrease. For example, the growth of the number of jobs that require high skills has slowed since the 2000s (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; Beaudry et al., 2016). In terms of wage returns to skills, Castex and Dechter (2014) report the returns to cognitive skills are substantially lower in the 2000s than in the 1980s.====Another important type of skills which have been missing in this discussion is those that accumulate through job experience. Since the seminal work by Becker (1964), skills obtained through job experience are recognized as human capital because those skills enable workers to achieve higher productivity, thus delivering a positive association with workers’ payoff.====The aim of this paper is to add another stylized fact — that the decrease in returns has also occurred with the human capital that accumulates through job experience. To the best of our knowledge, there are few papers analyzing the recent trend in returns to such human capital while other papers mainly focus on cognitive skills such as test scores. Given that the technological progress is skill-biased, our finding supports the recent observation that there is a shift in the types of skills demanded, as Deming (2017) argues returns to social skills that cannot be substituted by technology are increasing instead by enabling workers to reduce the cost of coordination and trade tasks according to their comparative advantage.====In this respect, Japan is a suitable arena for our analysis. Japan is known for its unique employment practice characterized by “lifetime employment;” where firms employ school graduates and promise employment until retirement age. In this practice, firms emphasize providing on-the-job training to their employees, and employees acquire a large part of their skills through job experience. The lifetime employment system and accumulation of “firm-specific” human capital among workers are known as major reasons for the Japanese economy's rapid growth until the 1980s.====Reflecting this context, there are rich series of studies analyzing the returns to human capital that we focus on. Especially after the 1980s, many papers assessed the steepness of the age-wage profile of Japanese workers (Hashimoto and Raisian, 1985; Mincer and Higuchi, 1988 etc.). In this paper, we analyze tenure-wage profiles of Japanese workers using the commonly used estimation method with the micro data of Japanese workers from the ==== (BSWS), and try to observe the chronological change in returns to human capital that accumulates through job experience. Along with the line of recent literature, we find that the returns to such human capital have been decreasing over time in the period from the 2000s to the 2010s.====Moreover, we use panel data of Japanese workers from the ==== (JHPS/KHPS) to estimate tenure-wage profiles to check whether the decreasing returns to skills estimated with BSWS is also observable after controlling for workers’ time-invariant characteristics. Another aim of using the panel data is to distinguish whether the decrease in returns has occurred with “general” or “firm-specific” human capital using Becker's definition by employing the two-stage estimation methodology used by Topel (1991). Our results show that such decrease has occurred mainly with firm-specific human capital.====In the analysis mentioned above, we assume that the wage is determined based on the workers' productivity. On the other hand, there is another widely accepted model that explains the positive association between wage returns and tenure without assuming the improvement of productivity which workers gain with job experience proposed by Lazear (1979). With this model in mind, as a robustness check, we test whether the recent trend of extending the retirement age of workers in reaction to an aging workforce led to the flattening of the tenure-wage profile using BSWS micro data. We finally find that such an effect exists, but explains only a marginal part of the observed decrease in returns.====On top of providing additional evidence to recent literature of decreasing returns to skills, this paper also contributes to the literature on wage profiles in the Japanese labor market in four folds. Firstly, we update tenure-wage profiles of Japanese workers in the 2010s which past studies have shown only up to the 2000s. Secondly, we use the panel data of Japanese workers to estimate wage profiles mitigating the endogeneity due to the omission of variables that are hardly observable such as workers’ characteristics and firm-worker matching quality. Taking advantage of the characteristics of the panel data and employing the method introduced by Topel (1991), we also decompose the changes in wage returns into general and firm-specific by estimating coefficients of job-experience and tenure at the current firm. Thirdly, we estimate the effect of the recent trend on retirement age extension by firms that Lazear's theory (1979) expects to flatten wage profiles apart from workers’ productivity. With the method proposed by Clark and Ogawa (1992), we find that Lazear's effect does flatten the Japanese workers’ wage profile, but it explains only part of the total flattening. Fourthly, we incorporated female employees into the target of our analysis. Previous studies on wage profiles in Japan mostly focused on male workers because it was in 1999 that the ==== banned discrimination against female workers in recruiting and promotion. In this paper, however, we conduct our estimation on both genders and are able to estimate steep wage profiles for not only male workers but also for female workers. We also find that the decrease in wage returns to skills happens with both genders====. Our analysis by gender implies a possibility of incorporating female workers into sample in future research on the wage structure in Japan.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 elaborates why we focus on wage profiles of Japanese workers to analyze returns to skills, and reviews previous literature on Japanese workers’ wage profiles. Section 3 explains the data for our analysis. Section 4 presents the estimated chronological change in returns to human capital associated with job experience using BSWS data. Section 5 reports the change in returns estimated using JHPS/KHPS and those separately estimated for “general” and “firm-specific” human capital. Section 6 presents how much the decrease in the returns can be explained by the recent trend of extending retirement ages by using BSWS data again.

In fact, they were “swinging” between admitting or not COVID-19 patients, especially during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. To address endogenous decision making, we estimated the effect of admitting COVID-19 patients on hospital profits using instrumental variable (IV) regression. We derived the IVs from the guidelines of the national government on which hospital types should admit COVID-19 patients. Our empirical results revealed that the monthly profits per bed decreased by approximately JPY 600,000 (==== USD 4615), which is 15 times the average monthly profit in 2019. This overwhelming financial damage indicates it is costly for some hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients because of their low suitability in admitting such patients. Based on the implications of our main results, we propose an alternative strategy to handling patient surges in case of new infectious disease outbreaks.","During the first COVID-19 outbreak, the potential financial meltdown of hospitals due to the admission of COVID-19 patients has become a worldwide policy issue. This problem was especially relevant in countries such as the US and Japan, where the private hospitals predominantly provide care for COVID-19 patients (====, ====). In the US, the AHA estimated a total financial loos of $ 202.6 billion for hospitals and the health system in the first four months of the pandemic (====).====Today, hospital financial health in Japan has a positive outlook because of the subsidies implemented by the government, but the situation during the first COVID-19 outbreak was very different. In fact, over 40% of Japanese medical institutions lowered their bonuses for nurses and other staff members in 2020 (====) to overcome the related financial difficulties, which could have potentially reduced staff motivation. To support the hospitals admitting COVID-19 patients, the government implemented large subsidy programs from June 2020 and expanded them afterward. As a result, hospitals recorded an unprecedented surplus in fiscal year 2020 (====). During the peak of the delta variant in August 2021, it was criticized that many public hospitals such as national hospitals and the hospitals in the Japan Community Health care Organization (JCHO) did not admit enough COVID-19 patients despite having received large subsidies.====The experience of the two years following the initial outbreak clearly demonstrates the importance of implementing a prompt but well-designed hospital subsidy system commensurate with the incentives hospitals have. In doing so, it is especially important to ascertain information accuracy regarding the amount of financial damage caused by the admission of COVID-19 patients and the mechanisms by which it occurs.====Despite the importance of this topic, to the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical analysis on this topic using hospital-level data. We were provided access to extremely valuable data the Tokyo Metropolitan Government collected to review hospitals’ financial standing during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, by utilizing unique monthly panel data on the hospitals in Tokyo, we explore how a pandemic outbreak affects hospital ====.====However, it is challenging to estimate the financial consequences of admitting COVID-19 patients because the hospitals in Japan have complete autonomy in deciding whether to admit these patients.==== Japanese hospitals always have the option of admitting or rejecting patients. Although a limited hospital capacity was the main reason for implementing measures that restrict people’s daily lives, hospitals are free to reject COVID-19 patients for legitimate reasons, such as insufficient staff to treat them. In this paper, we refer to Japanese hospitals as “swing hospitals” for simplicity, similar to the term “swing states” used for US elections, in that both options (i.e., admitting patients or not) are feasible.====In such an environment, hospital self-selection behavior must be considered when estimating the impact of admitting COVID-19 patients on profits. A simple comparison of the profits of the hospitals that admit COVID-19 patients with those that do not without considering self-selection behavior could result in a significant underestimation of the financial impact of admitting COVID-19 patients, since the hospitals that might incur huge financial losses are less likely to admit COVID-19 patients. Therefore, to solve the self-selection behavior of admitting or not COVID-19 patients, we used ==== (IVs). These IVs are derived from the national government guidelines on which types of hospitals should admit COVID-19 patients.====In addition, Tokyo is a unique locale and an ideal laboratory for estimating the effects of COVID-19 patient admissions on profits. This is because a large number of hospitals are geographically close and environmentally homogeneous in Tokyo. In fact, the number of hospitals per capita and the hospital bed density in Tokyo are higher than those in New York City, London, or Paris, being probably the highest in the world (====). This enabled us to identify the financial consequences of COVID-19 with great precision, because we were able to compare many hospitals with similar environmental characteristics.====Utilizing these advantages in our estimations, the empirical results revealed that the monthly profit per bed decreased by approximately JPY 600,000 (==== USD 4615),==== that is, 15 times the average monthly profit in 2019. Further, we also conducted a detailed analysis of hospital characteristics by hospital type, which revealed the mechanism of the large losses among swing hospitals. Indeed, this huge reduction in profits was driven by the cancellation of standard medical care. The main reason for the high number of cancellations for general patients was the difficulty to separate patients due to reasons such as old architecture (====, ====, ====, ====), thus making it impossible to balance the care of COVID-19 patients with the care of other patients. The difficulty of effective zoning has been repeatedly pointed out for Japan’s urban areas, where many hospital buildings are relatively old.====By considering hospitals’ heterogeneity regarding their suitability of admitting COVID-19 patients, we have identified important implications concerning hospital capacity policy for COVID-19 patients as follows. In fact, many hospitals in Japan had only 5 to 10 beds for COVID-19 patients, but once a COVID-19 patient is admitted, the financial loss was usually enormous due to other patient cancellations. After the initial outbreak ended, the government implemented large subsidies to maintain the number of beds for COVID-19 patients in such hospitals, although only few COVID-19 patients could be admitted. However, given our result that the marginal profit reduction from admitting COVID-19 patients was very large, we believe that this policy led to excessive subsidies for most hospitals. In fact, the subsidies based on the lessons learned from the first outbreak led to unprecedented financial surpluses for hospitals during FY2020 and perhaps even during FY2021 (====). This study thus suggests that the government needs to implement a subsidy policy to compensate hospitals for their financial losses that is commensurate with the nature of the outbreak of an infectious disease.",The financial health of “swing hospitals” during the first COVID-19 outbreak,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158322000272,29 July 2022,2022,Research Article,23.0

It investigates the effect of NRTPs (Generalized Systems of Preferences - ,"For more than half a century, developing countries have been enjoying non-reciprocal trade preferences (henceforth referred to as ""NRTPs"") offered by industrialized countries. The second conference of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held in 1968 adopted a resolution, i.e., Resolution 21 (II), which called for the establishment of a “generalized, non-reciprocal, non-discriminatory system of preferences in favour of developing countries, including special measures in favour of the least advanced among the developing countries” (see Grossman and Sykes 2005). Therefore, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)==== became the oldest and most prominent form of NRTP. The Enabling Clause, also referred to as “Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries” adopted in 1979, provides the permanent legal==== basis for granting GSP to developing countries.====The Resolution 21 (II) has provided that NRTPs should aim to increase export earnings for developing countries, promote industrialization and accelerate economic growth rates in developing countries (e.g., Bartels 2003, Grossman and Sykes, 2005; Persson, 2015a). Did the word ""industrialization===="" refer to ""export product diversification"" or eventually ""economic complexity""? This is an open-ended debate (see the discussion in Persson, 2015a).====The concept of ""export product diversification"" can be considered over products narrowly defined, or trading partners (e.g., Cadot et al. 2011; Dennis and Shepherd, 2011; Persson, 2015a). It can refer to a rise in the number of export products or trading partners, or indicate a more even distribution of exported goods (i.e., export diversification at the extensive margins). It can also entail an improvement in the shares of export volumes across active products or trading partners (i.e., export diversification at the intensive margins). From a development policy perspective, export product diversification at the extensive margins can be viewed as involving a shift in the export product structure from primary commodities to manufactured goods (Collier and Venables, 2007). In this specific case, export product diversification is closely related to the concept of 'industrialization', as contained in the UNCTAD Resolution 21 (II).====The concept of ""economic complexity"" (also termed ""economic sophistication"") is 'stronger' than that of 'export product diversification' as it embeds elements not captured in the concept of ""export product diversification"", notably the amount of knowledge and advanced capabilities embedded in the production process of goods exported. ""Economic complexity"" indicates the degree of sophistication of a country's productive (including its export) structure. It is primarily measured by the diversity of the country's export products basket (namely the degree of export product diversification at the extensive margins, including in terms of the number of products exported by the country concerned), and the ubiquity of these export products, that is, the number of countries that also export these products (e.g., Hausmann and Hidalgo, 2009, 2011; Hausmann et al., 2014). As a result, an economy is qualified as ""complex"" or ""sophisticated"" if it exports a high number of products, and if it has a low ubiquity for these export products, i.e., if these export products incorporate such exclusive capabilities that few other countries export these products.====Existing studies have shown that greater economic complexity is a good predictor of a country's future growth (Hausman and Hidalgo, 2009). It also fosters current economic growth====, reduces income inequality====, dampens economic growth volatility==== and economic growth cycles====, reduces poverty====, enhances human development====, increases labour share====, and ultimately promotes economic development====.====As the target group of countries in the UNCTAD Resolution 21 (II) was 'developing countries' whose export structure was known to be heavily dependent on primary commodities, one could reasonably expect the concept of 'industrialization' to, at least, signify export product diversification toward high value-added products, and eventually sophisticated products (i.e., complex products in the sense of Hausman and Hidalgo, 2009).====The bulk of the existing literature==== on the economic effects of NRTPs has focused on the effectiveness of NRTPs (many studies have particularly looked at GSPs) in particular in terms of export earnings by beneficiary countries (see discussion in section 2). Thus, most of these studies have considered the effectiveness of NRTPs with regard to one objective of NRTPs (i.e., ""to increase export earnings for developing countries""), as contained in the UNCTAD Resolution 21 (II). However, the other two goals of NRTPs stated in the UNCTAD Resolution 21 (II) (i.e., 'industrialization', and economic growth acceleration) have received less attention. We are not aware of an empirical work on the effect of NRTPs on economic growth in the beneficiary countries. In the meantime, concerning the ""industrialization"" goal, the related literature is still at its infancy, as few studies have looked at the effect of NRTPs on the industrialization of beneficiary countries (Gamberoni, 2007; Persson and Wilhelmsson, 2016; Yannopoulos, 1986).====Enhancing economic complexity in developing countries is particularly relevant in light of their structural weaknesses that hold back their development (e.g., Barrot et al. 2018; Briguglio et al., 2009; Dabla-Norris and Gündüz, 2014; Guillaumont, 2009; Guillaumont and Wagner, 2012; Wagner, 2014), and that have been aggravated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.====The current paper aims to contribute to the nascent literature on the effect of NRTPs on beneficiary countries' level of export diversification by investigating the effect of the utilization rates of NRTPs provided by the “Quadrilaterals” (also referred to as QUAD countries) on the level of economic complexity of beneficiary countries. The QUAD countries refer here to Canada, the European Union (EU), Japan and the United States of America (US).====As of today, NRTPs cover not only GSP schemes, but also non-reciprocal trade concessions provided by developing countries to LDCs (see WTO, 1999; 2019) and any other NRTP regimes authorised through a Waiver under the WTO==== Agreement. In addition to their GSP schemes, a number of developed countries, including QUAD countries provide several NRTPs to selected developing countries, under a special WTO Waiver. For example, the EU currently offers a non-reciprocal preferential treatment to products originating from the Western Balkans. The US offers the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) to eligible countries in Sub-Saharan African; the ""Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act"" to Caribbean countries, and in particular the ""Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement initiative"" to Haiti. Some non-reciprocal trade concessions are also provided by the US to Nepal, and to the ""Former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands"" (i.e., four countries, including Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau). Canada has currently been offering a tariff treatment to products from Commonwealth Caribbean countries. The WTO Preferential Trade Arrangements database contains all NRTPs, including both current ones and expired ones. It could be accessed online at: ====The contribution of the present study to the existing literature on the beneficiary countries' export performance (in particular export diversification) effects of NRTPs is two-fold.====First, it focuses on the economic complexity effect of NRTPs rather than merely on the export diversification effect of NRTPs, as investigated by Gamberoni (2007), Persson and Wilhelmsson (2016) and Yannopoulos (1986).====Second, previous studies used either simple statistical indicators (e.g., Yannopoulos, 1986) or dummies that represent a country's eligibility to a given preference programme in a single year, to identify the export diversification effect of NRTPs (Gamberoni, 2007; Persson and Wilhelmsson, 2016). In contrast, the present analysis relies on the utilization rate of NRTPs to examine the economic complexity effect of NRTPs. Thus, rather than merely assessing the effect of the eligibility to NRTPs on countries' export product diversification (as done by Gamberoni, 2007; Persson and Wilhelmsson, 2016), the present work considers the effect of the utilization (rates) of NRTPs on economic complexity. As a result, the first major difference between the current analysis and previous works lie on the nature of the dependent variable used, which is 'economic complexity' here, but 'export diversification' in previous analyses. The second major difference is that previous studies considered the effect of eligibility to a NRTP, whereas the current work touches upon the effect of the utilization (rate) of NRTPs. In fact, 'eligibility' to a NRTP does not necessarily involve its utilization.====The focus of the present study on the NRTPs provided by QUAD countries is dictated by the fact that the most comprehensive existing dataset on the utilization rates of NRTPs by beneficiaries countries covers only the QUAD countries (as providers of these NRTPs). This dataset has been made recently available publicly by the UNCTAD====. A first glimpse at the dataset used in the present analysis (see section 5) shows that in 2018, several countries==== made no use of either GSP programs or of 'Other trade preferences' (i.e., their utilization rates for each of these preference schemes were zero). At the same time, some countries==== exhibited utilization rates of GSP programs higher than 90%, while their utilization rates of 'Other trade preferences' amounted to 0. In contrast, only four countries (Botswana; Chad; Chile; Seychelles) had utilization rates of 'Other trade preferences' higher than 90%, but the utilization rates of GSP programs amounted to zero. These statistics highlight the need for considering the effect of the utilization rates of NRTPs on economic complexity. More than 50 beneficiary countries had shown utilization rates of both GSP programs and 'Other trade preferences' higher than 3%. Finally, no country fully utilizes its NRTP (i.e., either GSP programs or 'Other trade preferences'), i.e., the utilization rate of NRTP did not reach 100%.====The empirical analysis uses a country-year analytical framework, in contrast with Gamberoni (2007) and Persson and Wilhelmsson (2016) who have used gravity models (and hence relied on a country-pair/year framework) in their analyses. Based on the two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), it has established several findings. The utilization of NRTPs (GSP programs or other trade preferences) contributes to enhancing economic complexity when countries' exports under these preferences represents a high share of their total merchandise exports. Furthermore, GSP programs and other trade preferences offered by the QUAD countries jointly promote economic complexity when their utilization rates is high. These NRTPs also encourage the development of complex products when beneficiary countries enjoy high FDI inflows. Finally, development aid plays a crucial role in the relationship between the utilization of NRTPs and economic complexity. Especially, development aid and the utilization of NRTPs are strongly complementary in enhancing economic complexity in countries that experience high amounts of development aid.====The remaining part of the analysis contains seven sections. Section 2 provides a brief literature review on the effect of NRTPs on export earnings and export diversification. Section 3 discusses the effect of NRTPs on economic complexity. Section 4 deepens this discussion by analysing theoretically whether FDI inflows could help beneficiary countries of NRTPs make use of these NRTPs to develop complex products. Section 5 presents the estimation strategy. Section 6 interprets empirical results, and Section 7 undertakes a deeper analysis of the issue at hand. Section 8 concludes.",Effect of the utilization of non-reciprocal trade preferences offered by the QUAD countries on beneficiary countries' economic complexity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158322000247,18 June 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

To identify which firms faced a serious credit shock, we used variations in the long-term debt that must be repaid in the crisis. Because long-term debt takes more than one year to mature, it was determined independently of employment adjustments during the crisis. Therefore, using long-term debt maturing in a crisis, it is possible to identify the impact of exogenous tightening of the borrowing constraint on employment. We found that companies with a higher ratio of long-term debt maturing during the crisis had a greater negative impact on employment. In particular, the impact increased as the period passed from the shock, and this feature was most conspicuous in the group with the highest proportion of long-term debt maturing in the crisis.","Protecting employment in a deep recession is an important policy issue. Companies inevitably make job adjustments when business performance falls sharply. However, excessive job adjustment leads to serious social loss. This is particularly true when a large credit shock in the financial market causes unnecessary job adjustments in the labor market. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a large credit shock on Japanese employment during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers (hereafter, the Lehman shock) in September 2008.====Historically, the Japanese unemployment rate has been very low because companies have rarely fired their workers under the lifetime employment system. However, during the GFC, the Japanese unemployment rate increased by 1.7 percentage points between October 2008 and July 2009. In particular, the deep recession had a serious impact on the unemployment rate of non-regular workers whose job status was vulnerable. Given the serious economic downturn, job adjustments were inevitable. However, during the GFC, companies were forced to cut jobs because they faced serious borrowing constraints. This occurred partly because business performance fell sharply. However, this also occurred because a credit shock made the lending attitude of financial institutions relatively tight. Job adjustments would cause serious social losses when companies could continue their business as usual without borrowing constraints. Therefore, it is important to analyze the extent to which companies were forced to reduce employment due to borrowing constraints during the crisis.====A critical problem in conducting such an analysis is the identification of an exogenous change in the borrowing constraints of each company. Unless the constraints are tightened independently of the company's productivity, we cannot discern whether the tightened borrowing constraint causes a reduction in employment for the company. Most previous studies used predetermined variables to overcome the identification problem. Using U.S. data during the GFC, Duygan-Bump et al. (2015) identified the effects of exogenous funding constraints using variations in the degree of dependence on external funds by industry that existed before the crisis, based on individual-level data from the Current Population Survey. Chodorow-Reich (2014) identified the impact of banks’ reluctance to lend during the same financial crisis by focusing on the sticky relationship between firms and banks using U.S. loan data from Dealscan and firm-level data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During the Great Depression, Benmelech et al. (2019) identified the effects of exogenous funding constraints using the amount of long-term bonds maturing between 1930 and 1934 as a proxy for external funding constraints. Assuming that companies did not anticipate the Great Depression, most long-term corporate bonds maturing between 1930 and 1934 were issued before the Great Depression and determined independently of employment adjustments during the crisis.====Using an identification strategy similar to that of Benmelech et al. (2019), this study examines the impact of borrowing constraints on employment during the GFC in Japan. To identify which firms faced a serious credit shock, we used variations in the long-term debt that must be repaid in the crisis. Because long-term debt takes more than one year to mature, it was determined independently of employment adjustments during the GFC. Therefore, by using long-term debt maturing in the crisis, it is possible to identify the impact of exogenous tightening of the borrowing constraint on employment in the crisis. The analysis found that companies with a higher ratio of long-term debt maturing during the crisis had a greater negative impact on employment. In particular, the impact increased as the period passed from the shock, and this feature was most conspicuous in the group with the highest proportion of long-term debt maturing in the crisis.====The uniqueness of this study is that it eliminates endogeneity by using the ratio of long-term debt maturing in the crisis as a predetermined variable and examines the impact of tightened borrowing constraints on employment using firm-level data in Japan. In Japan, many studies have explored the impact of borrowing constraints on capital investment. However, few existing studies have rigorously investigated the impact of borrowing constraints on employment. This study provides a theoretical and empirical discussion on the channels through which companies may reduce employment due to funding difficulties during a crisis.",Effects of financial frictions on employment: Evidence from Japan during the Global Financial Crisis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158322000235,18 June 2022,2022,Research Article,25.0

However, intra-ASEAN trade as a percentage of total trade in the region has not increased significantly; instead, ASEAN countries' imports from China have grown dramatically. In this study, we examine the causal impacts of imports from China on intra-ASEAN trade by estimating gravity-type equations for intra-ASEAN trade at a highly disaggregated product level for the period 2000–2019. In particular, we address the issues of including observations with zero-valued trade and endogeneity in a gravity equation with multiple high-dimensional fixed effects. As a result, we found that imports from China significantly increase, rather than decrease, intra-ASEAN trade.","Member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have devoted much effort to increase trade among ASEAN members since the 1990s. The ASEAN free trade area (AFTA), created in 1993, originally consisted of six ASEAN countries, namely, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Vietnam joined in 1995, followed by Laos and Myanmar in 1997, and Cambodia in 1999. AFTA helped to reduce or eliminate tariffs on ASEAN trade by introducing a common effective preferential tariff among ASEAN countries. Furthermore, to pursue the goal of establishing a single market and production base with a free flow of goods, ASEAN member states signed the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) in 2009, which entered into force in 2010. All scheduled tariff reductions and removals were completed in 2018, and preferential tariff rates among ASEAN countries were reduced to zero on almost all products.====However, there has been a concern that a surge of imports from China is degrading domestic industries in ASEAN countries and harming ASEAN firms’ international competitiveness.==== Fig. 1 depicts the shares of imports from other ASEAN countries and China as a percent of total imports in ASEAN. It also shows the simple averages of ASEAN countries’ applied tariff rates against other ASEAN countries and China. Because of the creation of the ASEAN–China Free Trade Area (FTA) between ASEAN and China in 2005, these tariffs have gradually declined. However, only the share of imports from China has dramatically increased among ASEAN countries, from 5% in 2000 to 25% in 2019, whereas the share of intra-ASEAN trade has remained at around 25% despite the elimination of tariffs among ASEAN countries. In 2019, ASEAN imports from China exceeded intra-ASEAN trade, creating the impression that an explosive increase in imports from China has dampened regional trade among ASEAN member countries.====This study empirically examines the causal impacts of imports from China on intra-regional trade in ASEAN. To do so, we estimate a gravity-type equation with multiple high-dimensional fixed effects for intra-ASEAN trade at a highly disaggregated product level, covering the period from 2000 to 2019. Specifically, we introduce imports from China as our main independent variable to investigate how imports from China affect intra-ASEAN trade. To address the endogeneity issue in this variable, we use ASEAN–China FTA tariffs as an instrument. Furthermore, to include zero-valued trade observations, we take the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation for all variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to include zero-valued trade observations and address endogeneity in the gravity equation with multiple high-dimensional fixed effects. Our surprising result shows that imports from China significantly increase, rather than decrease, intra-regional trade in ASEAN. Namely, imports from China are found to have no negative impact on intra-ASEAN trade.====Our study is related to the literature on the trade effects of regional trade agreements (RTAs) as we focus on trade among RTA member countries (i.e., AFTA members). Trade creation effects, that is, the positive impact on trade among RTA member nations, have been investigated in many studies (e.g., Baier and Bergstrand, 2007).==== Our interest is slightly different than RTA trade creation effects and lies in the effects of trade with a third country (in this case, China) on trade between RTA members. There are also several studies that examine trade diversion effects, that is, the negative effects of RTAs on trade between RTA members and nonmember countries (Magee, 2008; Eicher et al., 2012; Dai et al., 2014; Yang and Martinez-Zarzoso, 2014). Because ASEAN also has an RTA with China, our analysis might have revealed diversion effects of one RTA (i.e., the ASEAN–China FTA) on trade among members of another RTA (i.e., AFTA/ATIGA), although we found no such effects.====Also included in the literature are studies of so-called China shocks. Because of China's rapid economic growth and admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001, many countries have experienced a dramatic increase in imports from China. A number of studies have shown that a surge in imports from China has led to a decrease in local jobs (e.g., Autor et al., 2013; Acemoglu et al., 2015; 2016; Pierce and Schott, 2016; Bloom et al., 2016; Asquith et al., 2019; Taniguchi, 2019; Hayakawa et al., 2021a, 2021b). Other studies have investigated the effects of growth in Chinese imports on countries’ social (Pierce and Schott, forthcoming; Autor et al., 2019) and political landscape (Autor et al., 2016). Against this backdrop, we investigate the impacts of Chinese imports on regional trade and show that China shocks have had positive effects on intra-ASEAN trade.====The rest of this study is organized as follows.

We find robust evidence that long-tenure managers tend to conduct these asset divestitures, especially when the divesting firm has a concentrated ownership structure. The result suggests that managers with the opportunity to extract private benefits establish entities that provide such opportunities. Meanwhile, large shareholders prevent managers from conducting these divestitures when they have sufficiently large cash flow rights. We find no evidence that firms launching listed subsidiaries achieve better financial outcomes than asset sell-off firms. Problematic entities in ==== further create such entities.","It is a well-known phenomenon that controlling shareholders expropriate minority shareholder wealth (Claessens et al., 2002; Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Although previous studies have found that ownership concentration and divergence between cash flow and control rights cause the expropriation problem, it is still unclear what makes such an ownership structure. Given that ownership structure is endogenous, it is worth investigating the underlying factors behind the problematic organizations. To address this issue, we investigate what firms conduct equity carve-outs and spin-offs. These transactions launch a listed subsidiary by selling a part of the shares of divested units to the public, thereby inherently generating a controlling-minority shareholder structure and providing the parent company with an opportunity to extract the wealth of minority shareholders.====Equity carve-outs are usually conducted by offering up to 50% of the shares to the public while allowing the parent company to keep more than 50% of the control rights of the subsidiary. In a similar manner, spin-offs leave certain control rights in the hands of managers, although the divested firms are generally considered to be independent entities. Spin-offs offer stock dividends to the parent company shareholders, including the managers. Importantly, Seward and Walsh (1996) find that spun-off entities are typically led by an inside CEO appointed from the formerly combined entity. Furthermore, Aron (1991) argues that corporate spin-offs represent a promotion-based motivation to appoint an inside-manager as the CEO of the new entity. This also suggests that managers of the parent firm keep control over the divested subsidiary. Hereafter, we denote equity carve-outs and spin-offs by IPO divestiture, as both of these transactions are conducted through initial public offerings.====It is challenging to investigate the determinants of the concentrated ownership structure of existing companies, as various financial characteristics of these companies likely stem from the ownership structure. To reduce the reverse causality concern, it is advantageous to investigate the characteristics of controlling shareholders when they decide to create such a problematic entity. IPO divestitures are conducted by listed companies for which detailed data are available. The data enable us to examine various factors that potentially cause the controlling-minority shareholder structure.====Previous studies suggest that controlling shareholders conduct related-party transactions to expropriate minority shareholder wealth (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Suppose that an investor, X, controls firms A and B, and has larger cash flow rights on firm A. Investor X can make gains by forcing firm B to buy firm A's assets or products for a higher price than the market price. IPO divestitures may increase opportunities of such a private benefit extraction by creating firm B in this example (controlling shareholders should have lower cash flow rights on listed subsidiaries than on the parent firm). Meanwhile, controlling shareholders make only small gains when the parent firm keeps high cash flow rights of divested subsidiaries. Previous studies also show two facets of large shareholders (Claessens et al., 2002). While controlling shareholders can expropriate minority shareholder wealth, large cash flow rights provide an incentive to discipline management, especially when managerial decisions have a significant impact on their wealth. Controlling shareholders bear costs if IPO divestitures are less efficient than other divestiture modes. This fact raises the possibility that large shareholders prevent firms from conducting IPO divestitures when they have large equity stakes. We investigate ownership concentration variables to address these issues.====Managers also have an incentive to pursue their own private benefits. Agency theory has long argued that CEOs strive to pursue private benefits (Jensen, 1986, 1993). Rajesh et al. (2006) argue that managers derive private benefits by controlling more assets (empire-building tendency). Managers of divesting companies can exert certain power over divested units and enjoy private benefits by choosing IPO divestitures. For instance, managers want to keep control rights of businesses they initiated or for which they have a personal feeling. Given managers’ compensations are linked to firm size (Bliss and Rosen, 2001), equity carve-outs may be beneficial because they do not downsize the consolidated financial statements. Managers can also reward their favorite subordinates by appointing them to the divested subsidiary as a manager/director.==== We adopt the manager's tenure to capture managerial incentives and the ability to pursue private benefits. Powerful managers can generally stay in the position for a long time and have significant opportunities to extract private benefits (Hermalin and Weisbach, 1998). Previous studies show that the frequency of management turnovers declines significantly when managers’ tenure is relatively long (e.g., Gregory-Smith et al., 2009; Yim, 2013). Chava et al. (2010) suggest that a longer CEO tenure increases the CEO's ability to shape the corporate management structure to enhance his/her power. Although several variables may represent managerial power (e.g., CEO ownership), long tenure indicates that the manager has long enjoyed nonpecuniary benefits by controlling the assets to be divested. With all other things being equal, long tenure also increases the possibility that the incumbent manager decided to initiate the business that should be divested, suggesting that large nonpecuniary benefits will be lost if the unit is completely divested. A manager's tenure also captures future nonpecuniary benefits to the degree that longer tenure indicates that incumbent managers can expect to stay in the position for a longer time subsequently.====We investigate these ideas by using Japanese data. A relatively large number of listed subsidiaries in Japan receive significant concerns from institutional investors regarding the expropriation of their wealth. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, there are 238 listed subsidiaries in Japan, accounting for about six percent of listed companies.==== Thus, it is relatively common in Japan for managers to keep control rights of divested units. Furthermore, the economic slump and excess debt problem in the 1990s forced Japanese companies to divest assets as US firms refocused during that decade.==== The existence of non-performing assets/divisions is likely to force managers to decide the level of control rights left on their hands after the divestment. The Japanese data provide us with a variety of insights into managers’ choice of ownership structure for the new entities they create.====By using the Bloomberg database search, we find that 348 equity carve-outs/spin-offs were conducted in Japan from January 2002 to December 2015. More than 90% (approximately 80%) of parent firms conducting equity carve-outs/spin-offs remained the largest shareholder of divested subsidiaries three (five) years after divestment. This figure suggests that these divestments provide managers with the instrument of divestment to keep control rights of divested assets. Given that IPO divestitures are a mode of asset divestment, we adopt asset sell-offs as a reference group. Previous studies have examined the determinants of the choice between the two divestitures (Bergh et al., 2008; Chen and Guo, 2005; Khan and Mehta, 1996; Michaely and Shaw, 1995; Nixon et al., 2000; Powers, 2001; Prezas and Simonyan, 2015). Different from IPO divestitures, asset sell-offs do not allow parent companies to pursue private benefits as the management completely relinquishes ownership of the divested assets. Previous studies have suggested that asset sell-offs bring better financial outcomes than IPO divestitures (Michaely and Shaw, 1995; Prezas and Simonyan, 2015). These facts suggest that firms should choose IPO divestitures only when the private benefits from IPO outweigh the financial outcome of asset sell-offs. We can highlight factors behind the emergence of controlling-minority shareholder structure by examining the choice between IPO divestitures and asset sell-offs. The Bloomberg data find 5,386 asset sell-offs during the period.====Our analyses find robust evidence that a manager's tenure is positively associated with the probability of firms choosing IPO divestitures over asset sell-offs. This relationship is supported by instrumental variable (IV) Probit regressions and propensity score-matching analyses as well as by simple logit regressions. Long-tenure managers choose IPO divestitures especially when the firm has a concentrated ownership structure. A significant portion (64 percent) of IPO divestitures is conducted by firms with a concentrated ownership structure (10 percent or higher largest shareholder ownership), while the corresponding portion is only 53 percent for asset sell-offs. This result suggests that managers can pursue private benefits when they are protected by powerful controlling shareholders. We also find that firms with very concentrated ownership structures (40 percent or more largest shareholder ownership) choose IPOs less frequently than those with a middle level of ownership concentration (largest shareholder ownership ranges from 20 to 40 percent). These results illustrate the pros and cons of ownership concentration. Controlling shareholders may discipline management when their cash flow rights are large enough, although they may create powerful managers who pursue private benefits.====If IPO divestitures are motivated by the extraction of private benefits, these transactions should create less value. Indeed, Michaely and Shaw (1995) find that firms conducting equity carve-outs and spin-offs significantly underperform the market. Prezas and Simonyan (2015) find that asset sell-offs achieve better post-divestiture performance for firms than spin-offs. We find that asset sell-off companies significantly improve performance (ROE and Tobin's Q), more so than non-asset divesting companies do, while such a pattern is not observed for IPO-divestiture companies. A significant difference exists in leverage reduction between asset sell-offs and equity carve-outs/spin-offs. Furthermore, IPO-firms show a significant stock price underperformance during the period from the announcement month to 12 months after the effective date, whereas the average sell-off firm outperforms peer companies. These findings support our view that IPO divestitures are driven by non-financial motives as well.====This research makes important contributions to the literature. Although numerous studies have investigated the outcome of concentrated ownership structure, we highlight the source of such a structure. Managers who have an opportunity to extract private benefits create entities that provide them with a similar opportunity. Previous studies have examined the effect of corporate governance structure on firm performance and behaviors (e.g., Ahn and Walker, 2007; Denis and Kruse, 2000; Kang et al., 2010). We contribute to the literature by showing a specific mechanism through which long-tenure managers under concentrated ownership structure engage in harmful behaviors. Furthermore, we show two facets of large shareholders. Their large cash flow rights are associated with their disciplinary role in the choice of asset divestitures, while powerful controlling shareholders who allow a single person to manage a company for a long time serve as a fundamental factor behind the expropriation problem. We also contribute to the literature on asset divestitures. Previous studies have examined the effect of the attributes of divested assets, such as size and risk (Chen and Guo, 2005; Khan and Mehta, 1996), the financial constraints of the divesting firm (Michaely and Shaw, 1995; Nixon et al., 2000; Powers, 2001), information asymmetry (Chen and Guo, 2005), overvaluation (Prezas and Simonyan, 2015), and relatedness between the divesting firm and the assets being divested (Bergh et al., 2008). We show novel evidence that the private benefit motive of the parent company affects the method of asset divestiture. Listed subsidiaries have recently received attention from regulatory authorities due to their inherent nature, causing expropriation problems. Our results suggest that long-tenure managers in a concentrated ownership structure serve as a factor associated with the presence of listed subsidiaries in Japan.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

A regime-switching model estimates that the regime with low decay factor and bond yield volatility (“low” regime) has persisted since the early years of Bank of Japan's quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) policy. A shift away from the low regime can instantly increase the 10-year government bond yield by over 50 basis points by increasing the term premiums with little changes in the expected short rate.","Low–interest rate environments are becoming increasingly common worldwide. In particular, Japan has already been in a zero-rate environment for more than two decades, as depicted in Figure A1 in the Appendix. During these years, the short-term interest rate has remained near zero, while the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield has fallen from about 2% to 0%. Further, the long-term bond yield has remained at very low levels with very small fluctuations since September 2016, when the Bank of Japan (BOJ) committed to purchase JGBs to achieve its targets of long- and short-term interest rates under yield curve control. Is there a novel aspect of yield curve characteristics that should be analyzed to explain these yield curve dynamics?====This study applies a dynamic Nelson–Siegel (1987, NS) yield curve framework to examine Japan's low–interest rate en–vironment. It particularly investigates the role of decay factor which appears to have declined in Japan (Figure 1).==== By comparison, it slightly declined in the 2010s in the United States, Germany (the country that generally evidences the lowest interest rates in the euro area), and Switzerland (Figure A2). As discussed in Section 2, the NS framework implies that the lower the decay factor, the lower the level and volatility of long-term bond yields.====Given the stronger evidence of the decay factor decline in Japan, we first estimate a dynamic NS model with regime switching for Japan, relaxing a common parameter restriction with respect to the decay factor. Specifically, we allow the decay factor parameter and other selected model parameters to take on different values across two regimes, where one regime has a low decay factor and bond yield volatility (i.e., the low regime) and the other has a higher decay factor and bond yield volatility (i.e., the high regime). The benchmark model is a special case of Hevia, Gonzalez-Rozada, Sola, and Spagnolo (2015) without no-arbitrage restrictions. We find that the 10-year bond yield is compressed by about 53 basis points under the low regime on average, mostly via term premium reduction. Some researchers on Japanese yield curve (e.g., Fujiki and Shiratsuka, 2002 and Okina and Shiratsuka, 2004) suggest that the decay factor reflects the degree of forward guidance.==== Their views are not necessarily inconsistent with our finding, because the term premium can decrease when forward guidance provides greater clarity about the path of future interest rates.====To further examine the nature of decay factor dynamics, we also estimate an alternative dynamic NS model, allowing the decay factor to depend on the lagged yield curve factors (Koopman, Mallee, and Van der Wel, 2010). The alternative model also allows us to compute how bond yield and term premium respond to a shock to the decay factor. Impulse responses of bond yields to a decay factor shock are driven by term premium changes, consistent with the results from the benchmark model. Further, simple regressions find that the decay factor shock is correlated with the size and maturity of BOJ government bond holdings, plausibly capturing the duration risk effects (e.g., Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011; Vayanos and Vila, 2021).====While this study relaxes a common parameter restriction with respect to the decay factor, it still has limitations. First, as mentioned, it does not apply the NS model in a no-arbitrage framework.==== Second, this study does not explicitly introduce a zero lower bound (ZLB). This is because the entire sample period used for estimation falls within a ZLB environment and bond yields often takes negative values in Japan.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the role of the decay factor in the NS model. Section 3 explains the data and estimation strategy, presents the estimated results, and analyzes how the expected short rate (and thus the term premium) differs across regimes.

In contrast, we find that non science-intensive NME stock does not significantly enhance these outcomes. Our results also suggest that controlling for the effects of surgeries does not reduce the effects of science-intensive drugs and that quality of science exploited for the discovery of an NME also plays a role in the effects. We have validated our indicator of science-intensive NMEs as a measure of the contribution of drugs to treatment, based on a survey of physicians. The results show that scientific advancement and exploitation for drug innovations critically contribute to improving human welfare.","Science substantially underlies pharmaceutical innovations (Mansfield, 1998; Pisano, 2006; Li et al., 2017). However, existing studies have not yet provided clear quantitative evidence for the connection between science and pharmaceutical innovation in terms of the improvement of welfare of patients. The objective of this study is to contribute to bridging this gap by examining how new science-intensive drugs improve the longevity of the population and the cure rate of hospitalized patients (inpatients).====Extensive empirical literature exists on the economic effects of improving health conditions (Nordhaus, 2003; Murphy and Topel, 2006; Cutler et al., 2006, 2017). There is also increasing literature on the contributions of new drugs, especially focused on longevity. For example, Cutler et al. (2008) show that appropriate therapies, including pharmaceuticals and invasive procedures, significantly explain improvements in disability and reduction in the death rate from cardiovascular diseases, using patient level data. Lichtenberg (2005., 2007, 2017) presented substantial evidence that faster increase of the drug vintage led to better health outcomes, such as a greater increase in the mean age of death, smaller increases in the total number of hospital admissions, and larger decreases of medical expenditure, based on disease-level panel data. A major constraint of existing research is that it does not clearly identify the overall contribution of science-intensive drugs to health. Some recent studies aim to quantify the contribution of science to inventions, based on the correlations between the science intensity of a patent and patent value, as per Watzinger and Schnitzer (2019) and Poege et al. (2019). While these are valuable contributions, they do not directly assess the contributions of science to the welfare of the population such as longevity and cure rate.====This study examines how new science-intensive drugs improves the health conditions of the population, based on disease-level panel data, expanding on and extending the above two strands of literature. There are several potential measures of health, but longevity is central to human welfare (Dow et al., 1999; Murphy and Topel, 2003; Hall and Jones, 2007). In this study, we use two complementary measures of health outcomes to assess the effects of larger diversity of available science-intensive drugs on longevity: mean age at death and cure rate of the inpatients at disease-level. The mean death age for a disease can increase not only because of lower death rate from that disease but also because of the decline of the aggregate probability of being diagnosed with any fatal disease (see analytical framework 2.2), while cure rate from hospitalization is disease specific. Regarding science intensity, we developed the indicators of new drugs launched in Japan at the level of a new molecular entity (NME). We used the data from scientific literature cited by the inventors of the patents that protect NMEs. We also matched the drugs and the diseases, based on prescription data and constructed longitudinal-disease-level panel data for health conditions and drug availability, following the International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10). We used an NME as a counting unit of drugs available for each disease.====To summarize, our estimates show that the increase in the diversity of science-intensive NMEs (or NME stock) used for treating a disease, significantly contributed to longevity and to the improvement of the cure rate of inpatients as a result of the disease. In contrast, we find that non science-intensive NME stock does not significantly enhance these results. Our results also suggest that controlling for the effects of surgeries does not reduce the effects of the science-intensive drugs and that the quality of science exploited for the discovery of an NME also plays a role in the effects. We have also validated the indicator of science-intensive NMEs as a measure of the contribution of drugs to treatment, based on a survey involving physicians. Thus, the results show that scientific advances exploited for drug innovation critically contribute to improving human welfare.====This paper is organized as follows.

Reorganizations include ","The financial environment surrounding Japanese regional banks has been deteriorating. According to NHK World-Japan 2021, for the fiscal year ending March 2021, almost half of the 78 larger Japanese regional banks have announced that their main business had losses or profit decreases. This means bank revenues did not cover lending costs and commission fees.==== Further, the Financial System Report of April 2019 by the Bank of Japan 2019 estimated that about 60 percent of Japanese regional banks may experience cumulative losses over the next 10 years. The main causes for Japanese regional banks to be in this deteriorating situation is an untended side effect of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy along with the decline of regional economies. The Bank of Japan has adopted a negative interest rate policy to increase the total amount of money in circulation with the aim of eliminating deflation. As a result of negative interest rates, banks are forced to decrease their lending rates. Whereas major Japanese banks have started to find solutions by expanding their businesses in the U.S. and Asia, Japanese regional banks have continued to endure hardship because of their focus on rural economies. Japan's rural areas have experienced unprecedented changes in their demographic structures; the proportion of elderly people relative to working-age people has increased. This change had led to disproportionate declines in rural economic growth rates and economic vitality. To cope with the decline, regional banks are being forced to reorganize in order to improve cost efficiency, profitability and fiscal health. Japan's financial policies require healthy regional banks to provide a foundation for prosperous regional economies. Reorganizations through mergers and the forming of holding companies may be part of the solution to their long-term decline.====The paper examines recent Japanese regional bank reorganizations using an event study methodology with daily stock price data. We ask whether reorganizations are an effective way to rejuvenate regional financial institutions through operational synergies, scale economies and market power. Further, this research seeks to understand what types of reorganization create greater value. It compares the stock market's response to different types of reorganizations among the population of regional banks that changed their structures over the period from 2008 to 2019. This approach assumes that rational and efficient stock markets make unbiased estimates of the value of bank reorganizations. A significant appreciation in the price of a bank stock on the announcement date of the reorganization means the change is an improvement in the bank's future profitability and stability.

We find that i) the increase in the aged population share can account for most of the decline in employment and reduced output by 8%, ii) workweek shortening policy led to a 20% reduction in output from its potential level by reducing hours worked over the 1988-1994 period, iii) the rise in labor tax led to an 11% reduction in output from its potential level by discouraging hours worked, iv) the shift in the composition of government spending may have caused a slowdown in productivity growth and hence a reduction in the potential output level itself.","A key feature of the postwar Japanese economy is the rapid population aging. The share of population above 65 years old among the population above 15 years old has increased from 8% in 1955 to 30% in 2015, which is currently the highest among all economies in the world. Moreover, other countries around the world are expected to follow this pattern (Otsu and Shibayama (2016)). In this paper, we quantitatively assess the macroeconomic impact of population aging and related government policies in Japan over the 1975-2015 period.====There are several related previous studies on population aging in Japan. Chen et al. (2007) and Braun et al. (2009) use overlapping generations model to study the effects of the demographic transition on the Japanese savings rate over the 1960-2000 period. They find that total factor productivity plays a more important role than demographic transitions in accounting for the fluctuation in the savings rate. Yamada (2012) further introduces idiosyncratic labor income shocks in the overlapping generations model in order to analyze the inter and intra-generational distribution of earning and consumption in Japan over time. Kitao (2015) and Kitao (2018) quantify the fiscal cost of population aging in Japan within an overlapping generations model with a social security system. Fujiwara and Teranishi (2008) incorporates the life-cycle framework of Gertler (1999) into a New Keynesian model to analyze the effect of population aging on the amplification of monetary policy shocks.====There are also several related studies that analyze the impact of productivity growth on economic growth in a representative agent neoclassical growth model. Hayashi and Prescott (2002) and Chen et al. (2006) show that total factor productivity growth is important in accounting for the postwar Japanese economic performance. Otsu (2009) shows that the transition effect of capital destruction during the war cannot account for the postwar growth patterns of macroeconomic variables and that productivity growth is the key driver for the postwar evolution of output, consumption, investment and labor.====In order to analyze the effect of population aging on economic growth, we construct a model with young and old adults who belong to a representative household. The head of the household determines the resource allocation within the family based on individual preferences and the family budget constraint. We assume that the individual preference function is separable between consumption and leisure. We further assume that the head of the household is an old adult who has altruism for future generations. Under these assumptions, we show that the model collapses into a parsimonious infinite horizon representative household neoclassical growth model with young and old adults. Population aging defined as the increase in the fraction of old adults among total adult population is treated as exogenous. We assume that young and old adults have fixed employment rates and that of old adults is lower so that population aging directly affects the aggregate employment rate. In addition, we incorporate government fiscal policies that are related to population aging such as government spending and taxes.====In addition to the growth path of output, we also discuss the effects of various shocks on the hours worked per worker that have declined since the 1990s. Otsu (2009) shows that productivity growth and subsistence consumption can explain the decline in hours worked during the rapid growth period in the 1960s but not the decline in hours during the lost decade in the 1990s. Hayashi and Prescott (2002) and Yamada (2012) argue that the government policy to reduce the workweek over the 1988 to 1993 period played an important role in the decline in hours worked.

It uses Japanese buyer–seller relationship data constructed by applying more suitable criteria for sampling firms. The results show that upstream manufacturing firms lower the probability of closing by selling their products to downstream manufacturing firms which increase their exports or imports. Interestingly, few unfavorable outcomes of indirect trade shocks were observed. These findings suggest that the economic impact of firms’ ==== on upstream suppliers is more nuanced than just a substitute or complement between international and domestic trade.","Empirical studies have demonstrated that firms benefit from the export of their products through an increase in productivity and sales (Atkin et al., 2017, Munch, Schaur, 2018; and Garcia-Marin and Voigtländer, 2019). It has also been established that firms’ imports of intermediate goods have a positive effect on importing firms via learning, variety, and quality effects (Amiti and Konings, 2007, Goldberg et al., 2010, Kasahara and Rodrigue, 2008; and Topalova and Khandelwal, 2011). While both exports and imports positively affect firms that engage directly in trading activity, there is a legitimate concern that they may affect upstream domestic firms differently. Considering the dense web of domestic buyer–seller networks, the ripple effect of trade shocks from downstream to upstream firms through these links is also an important aspect of various trade effects. Although this view is well recognized, the propagation of trade effects through inter-firm transactions has not been empirically investigated in any country, with the exception of Japan and Belgium, because of limited data availability.====In Japan, two private credit reporting companies compile buyer–seller link data. Based on the data, some studies explored the indirect effects of trade shocks from exporters or importers on upstream seller firms. For exports by downstream firms, Fujii (2017) established that although direct exporters account for less than 2 percent of all Japanese firms, more than half the firms indirectly export by selling to direct exporters under one or two transaction relations. He also showed the statistical significance of shocks to direct exporters propagating to indirect exporters. For imports by downstream firms, one may expect a negative impact on upstream seller firms because of the direct displacement effect of offshoring buyer firms replacing domestic suppliers with foreign suppliers. However, Furusawa et al. (2018) showed a different view from their empirical analysis in that Japanese firms that start offshoring tend to drop fewer links with upstream domestic suppliers and add more nearby suppliers, which produce differentiated inputs. In addition, Ito and Saito (2021) reported that experiences of Japanese firms with both indirect exports and imports through their downstream direct traders in 2014 were positively correlated with their own higher performance in 2016. However, they did not explore the causality.====In Belgium, buyer–seller data originate from the annual declarations of deliveries by VAT-registered businesses to the Belgian tax administration. Dhyne et al. (2015) and Dhyne and Duprez (2017) outlined of the dataset. Dhyne et al. (2021) calculated in detail the number of firms and their extent of connections to foreign markets directly and indirectly. They also found some characteristics regarding indirect trade, including more persistent buyer–seller links with a higher share of indirect trade and the similar impact of foreign demand shocks through either direct or indirect exports on a firm’s revenue.====These pioneering findings shed light on how international trade impacts domestic firms through inter-firm transactions. This path is worth exploring. The majority of domestic firms connect to foreign markets through firm-to-firm linkages, even though there are only a handful of direct exporters or importers in countries (Fujii, 2017 and Ito and Saito, 2021 for Japan and Dhyne et al., 2021 for Belgium). Hence, this study estimates the impact of changing the volume of international trade by downstream, direct-trading firms on business performance in upstream, indirect-trading firms using Japanese data. It expands the investigations by Fujii (2017) and Dhyne et al. (2021) by considering not only sales but also the probability of closure, value added, and other indices of business performance in upstream seller firms. Most studies set the backdrop and suggest hypotheses in the Introduction section. In this study, however, it is hard to predict whether direct trade by downstream firms positively or negatively affect a certain aspect of upstream firms’ business performance due to the complexity of diverse possible causality, as explained in the following section. Therefore, I do not introduce any hypotheses to avoid the predetermination of dominant causality.====There are some potential factors that can contaminate the estimates of indirect trade impacts on business performance. The simultaneous shocks of indirect imports and exports are one of them. When examining how the decision to start importing or increase imports by downstream firms affects business performance in upstream firms, the estimation results are biased if possible simultaneous export shocks from downstream firms are not excluded. Another factor is the ranking of the business performance of upstream seller firms. As Fujii et al. (2017) pointed out, for manufacturing exports in Japan, the distributions of sales and labor productivity are ordered for direct, indirect, and non-exporters. It means that larger or more productive upstream sellers tend to form links with downstream trading firms. This endogeneity of the buyer–seller linkage also produces biased results. These concerns need to be addressed, especially in the context of Japanese buyer–seller link data, where there is no information about the bilateral values of their domestic transactions.====To extract causality from expanding or shrinking direct imports or exports in downstream firms to various aspects of business performance in upstream firms, this study employs propensity score matching (PSM) combined with a difference-in-differences (DID) approach. Hijzen et al. (2011) and Brucal et al. (2019) employed PSM-DID to evaluate the impact of firms’ internationalization on their economic outcomes. They utilized the benefit of DID, which eliminates the influence of the constant and unobservable elements of these firms by focusing on the difference in the trend of the variables of interest before and after the internationalization decision. This study applies DID to supplier firms because their time-invariant factors are difficult to observe. It may directly affect their business outcomes and indirectly affect them through the formation of links between upstream suppliers and downstream buyers, which are endogenous and determined by factors on both sides of firms (Furusawa et al., 2018, Sugita, Teshima, Seira, 2021). I employ stringent criteria for choosing firm subjects to estimate the effects, unbiased by other international transactions. The treatment group for PSM is composed of upstream seller firms whose main downstream buyers engage in either imports or exports, whereas the control group consists of upstream seller firms whose main buyers are domestic firms that conduct neither international trade nor foreign direct investment (FDI).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the methodology used to estimate the impact of trade shocks on upstream non-associated firms. Section 3 describes the data used in this study. Sections 4 and 5 present the results of upstream firms’ closures and other aspects of their performance, respectively, and discuss the findings.

This study analyzes whether these programs induce public assistance recipients to work. Drawing on a unique dataset for a representative Japanese municipality X, I estimate the program effects by using ==== to address the selection bias. The analysis reveals several important findings. First, the programs raise the welfare recipients’ employment rate. Second, lock-in effects are not significantly observed in most cases. Third, the effects of the programs are not large enough to allow beneficiaries to get off welfare through employment. Finally, there is no substantial difference in the results pre- and post-matching.","Over the past few decades, many countries, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, have responded to a growing number of welfare claims by implementing welfare reforms. Most countries have moved away from passive benefit payments to impose stronger job search and work requirements on welfare recipients, with the goal of promoting employment and reducing welfare dependency. Beneficiaries are often required to participate in active labor market programs, and failure to comply may be met with sanctions, such as reduced benefits (Blank, 2002; Huber et al., 2011). The long recovery period that followed the Great Recession has seen renewed interest in the potential use of active labor market policies to alleviate a wide range of problems, including unemployment and low-income workers (Martin, 2015).====Many studies have been conducted on the effects of active labor market programs, especially in Western countries. According to the meta-analysis by Card et al. (2018) focusing mainly on Western countries, active labor market programs, such as job search assistance, training programs, and private subsidies, have negligible short-term average impact when employment rates are used as an outcome. However, they have positive effects, of less than 10%, two to three years after the end of the program. Participants often interrupt their normal job search activities to devote time to program activities, which generally worsens outcomes immediately after program completion. The time profile of the so-called lock-in effect varies across programs, with larger average positive effects for programs focusing on human capital accumulation. The study by Vooren et al. (2019) finds that subsidized labor and public job creation schemes have negative short-run and positive long-run impacts; training programs and job search assistance, however, have no negative short-term effects and their positive effects last between 6 and 36 months from the start of the program.====Like in many other countries, Japan's employment support programs for public assistance recipients have become increasingly important with the post-recession increase in the number of households able to work since 2008. The overall program objective is to either bring welfare recipients into the labor market or increase their labor income and wean them off welfare dependency. The programs include cooperation between municipalities and the Public Employment Service Office for job search assistance, and municipalities' individual employment support programs such as basic education, job training, job interview preparation, and volunteer activities. In a representative Japanese program for Municipality X, the welfare office requires all beneficiaries who are able to work to participate in the program. Those who wish to find a job independently are exempted from participation as long as they report their monthly job search activities. As a result, a selection bias may arise, as beneficiaries are not randomly assigned to participate in the program.====Few studies examine whether the active labor market programs for welfare recipients in Japan lead to their employment. Among them, Tamada and Ohtake (2004) use cross-sectional data obtained from municipalities in the Osaka prefecture and find that support programs such as skill development courses and job fairs do not affect the employment rate. Their study mentions that some municipalities select beneficiaries who are likely to get off welfare and encourage them to actively participate in the programs (Tamada and Ohtake, 2004). Michinaka (2009) evaluates programs based on aggregate data from selected participants in one municipality to show that only around one-third of the participants are employed, most of them on a part-time basis. Thus, few program participants manage to break out of the welfare net. Shikata (2013) also evaluates the program based only on participant data. A problem with previous studies is that they do not include information on non-participants. Thus, this study analyzes microdata for a representative Japanese municipality—X—by including employment support program non-participants among the welfare recipients to examine whether such programs motivate participants to work.====The contributions of this study are two-fold. First, as the microdata of all welfare recipients in the municipality is available, I use propensity score matching (PSM, Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983) to identify the effect of active labor market programs on recipients’ behavior. Given program participants’ higher willingness to work, previous studies inevitably suffer from treatment selection bias. In this study, I address this issue. Second, I focus on the program effects on a specific household type, called “other types of households.” These are receipt households other than elderly, disabled, sick, or single-mother households, and thus can be regarded as the working population. This target population is predominantly male and not necessarily young, with an average age of 50 years and above. In Japan, there is a concern that the number of these households will increase post COVID-19. Therefore, evaluation of the program for these households is urgently needed.====The results are summarized as follows: I find that the programs raise the employment rate of welfare recipients. In the case of the cooperative program with the Public Employment Service Office, the employment rate increases by up to 25.6%, but the effects of getting a job with higher income are not observed, especially when focusing on “other types of households.” In addition, lock-in effects are not significantly observed in most cases. Regarding the suspension rate, no effects are found in all cases, showing that the effects of the programs are not large enough to allow beneficiaries to get off welfare through employment. The results also show that there is no substantial difference between the pre- and post-matching results.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the public assistance system and employment support programs for beneficiaries in Japan, focusing on Municipality X. Section 3 explains the empirical model. Section 4 describes the data used in this study. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 discusses the results.

To solve such a problem, the Japanese government rectified the property tax preferential treatment of urban farmland in the 1990s. We utilize this reform as a natural experiment and examine its impact on land use. The empirical results show that the reform did not encourage the conversion of urban farmland into housing lots. This is one of the reasons concerning the shortage of housing supply in urban areas in Japan.","In a standard public finance textbook, property tax on land is neutral with respect to resource allocation. However, the reality is that property tax is distortive because preferential tax treatment is provided for certain use of land.==== Indeed, the taxable value of farmland turns out to be lower than that of housing lots in many countries.==== Such preferential treatments are also given to farmland within cities and inner suburbs (hereafter defined as urban areas).==== In this circumstance, landowners will be reluctant to convert their farmland for other uses. Consequently, more valuable uses (e.g., housing lots or office buildings) may be forgone as suggested by Bruce (2000), which may ultimately hinder urbanization. However, to our knowledge, the effects of preferential property tax law reforms on land use in urban areas remains underexplored.====The objective of this study is to examine the effects of the property tax reform in Japan in the 1990s, abolishing preferential tax treatment in the urban areas. In fact, Japanese local governments in the three metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Chubu, and Kansai) have been eager to preserve farmland, leading to the circumstances discussed by Bruce (2000).==== The fundamental reform aimed to limit the preferential tax measures so as to induce landowners to transform their farmland into residential lots.====Let us touch upon the preferential treatment of farmland and the history of the reform in Japan. Farmland in Japan has been classified as either ordinary farmland or farmland in urban promotion areas (hereafter UPA farmland). UPA farmland in the designated cities within the three metropolitan areas (hereafter referred to as the designated cities) is taxed as housing lots. Note that the terminology “designated cities” follows Ishi (1991), and does not mean that the government chose these cities solely for tax purposes (see Section 2 details on the selection process).==== Meanwhile, the data on housing lots also encompasses commercial land within the Japanese official statistics on property taxes. Although we use the word “housing lots (or residential lots)” to put it simply, bear in mind that this phrase means the land for both business and residential purposes.====However, in practice, there existed preferential property tax treatment for the UPAs in the designated cities prior to the reform. Accordingly, many farmland owners in the major cities exploited this system and escaped higher tax burdens by “disguising” their property as farmland, which was pointed out by Ishi (1991). To solve this problem, the preferential property tax measure was repealed at the end of FY 1991 (March 1992), details of which are presented in Section 2.==== The reform, which took effect in FY 1992, aimed to induce landowners to convert their farmland into housing lots such as apartments and commercial buildings, which was expected to encourage urbanization.====We examine impacts of the tax reform using difference in difference (DID) estimation. We set the designated cities as the treatment group whereas all other comparable cities are as the control group. Municipality level data are used for our empirical investigation.====Our results contribute to two literatures. First, this study is related to the literature on the effects of preferential property tax treatment. A number of studies have addressed this issue: Brueckner (2001), Brueckner and Kim (2003), Lynch (2003), Song and Zenou (2006, 2009), Polyakov and Zhang (2008), Anderson et al. (2015), Wassmer (2016), and Yagi and Garrod (2018). These studies focus on how preferential property tax treatment of farmland is useful to solve deficiencies of farmland resources and urban sprawl, and thus the rationale for such treatment is addressed. In contrast, the novelty of this study is to conduct empirical analyses on the distortionary effects of the preferential treatment on land use in urban areas.====Furthermore, our research contributes to the literature on the effects of property tax reforms that use natural or quasi-experimental approaches such as the reforms’ effects on fiscal competition (Lyytikäinen 2012, Skidmore et al. 2012), the real estate market (Dachis et al. 2012), housing investments (Löffler and Siegloch 2015, Lutz 2015, Gemmell et al. 2019), and tax collection (Stine 2003, Ross and Yan 2013). However, to our best knowledge, nobody has explored the reforms with respect to the preferential treatment of land use. We differentiate ourselves by utilizing a natural experiment provided by the reform in Japan.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

With this purpose, we reconstruct the region's bilateral imports before the establishment of ==== Areas and pioneer the ==== of the main drivers of the commercial integration of East and Southeast Asia as a whole during the high colonial era (1840-1938). Our results display that countries' specific economic and cultural characteristics made them natural trading partners. However, intra-Asian trade acceleration during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries was possible by the British ==== of free trade and Japanese planned industrialization.","After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, growing concerns about the need to deepen regional integration in East and Southeast Asia have paved the way to a proliferation of studies about the degree of economic interdependence inside this region and its main determinants. Their theses have given birth to three distinct currents: First, scholars defend the existence of economic characteristics attached to this region which justify the extraordinary intensity of intra-Asian trade across history (Sugihara 2019). The coexistence of these interior features would concede East and Southeast Asia countries the category of natural trading partners (Khadan and Hosein 2013), making continuing the current integration process highly advisable (Wonnacott et al., 1989). Secondly, we have authors advocating that East and Southeast Asia regional integration has taken place on behalf of Western Empires (Petri 2006). Finally, researchers claim that contemporary intra-Asian connections were possible thanks to the creation and spread of East Asia capitalism by the Japanese Empire (Hori 2016).====The present article is among those supporting that these views are compatible when a long-run perspective is adopted. We hypothesize that regional trade between East and Southeast Asian countries has been persistent across history due to their condition of natural trading partners. However, the acceleration appreciated during the high colonial era was only possible through Western Empires dominating the region and the expansion of the local Japanese Empire. With this purpose, this research starts before establishing any Free Trade Area and covers the whole Age of Empires (1840-1938).====Supporters of naturally driven integration expose the existence of short-distance and demand complementarities inside the region as drivers of the extraordinary intraregional trade intensity prevalent in East and Southeast Asia. Similarly, some authors attest that active commercial networks created in the Ancient Age reflect the region's cultural and ethnic similarities (Reid 1988). This article studies those features in the context of the First Globalization, where they became more remarkable (Sugihara and Kawamura 2013). At the start of this period, most regional trades consisted of exchanges of silver and opium between China and British India, orchestrated basically by Great Britain. Restrictions to Opium trade during the 1830s and 1840s led to the Opium Wars won by the British and the forced opening of Chinese ports to free trade. Thus, the signature of unequal treaties was the first imperial policy that enabled exponential growth in regional trade. Afterward, the British developed an intense commercial network linking Europe with China and British India across the British intermediate ports of Hong Kong and Singapore. Lately, the rest of the European empires long ago settled in the region like the Dutch, the French, or the Spanish (replaced by the USA in 1898) started to adhere and improve through investments in transport and communications infrastructure and enforced low tariffs within the region.====According to our data, the first traces of regional intensification date back to the 1860s and 1870s, in which the volume of transit trade around Hong Kong and Singapore started to be expanded by investment in commercial infrastructure and the enforcement of low tariffs in Chinese Treaty Ports by the British Empire. At the same time, British colonies started to exploit reductions in intra-bloc transaction costs to raise commercial exchanges. Afterward, during the interwar years, the British dominion was substituted by the newly created Japanese Empire. In contrast to the British, it developed a discriminatory trade bloc with its colonies in East Asia and employed informal empire mechanisms for introducing its manufactures all over the region.====All in all, the objective of the present paper is to illustrate those economic and political conditions empirically, and that is why it is the first modeling determinants of regional trade for the whole of East and Southeast Asia before WWII, instead of just analyzing a particular sub-region. In this line, we demonstrate that Japanese influence in regional trade was not limited to its colonies in the East but also to Southeast Asian territories, which composed its informal Empire. To prove these theories, we reconstruct bilateral imports disaggregated by the country partner for 13 countries integrating the region between the years 1840-1938. This new database includes a novel treatment of transit trade that brings a more precise image of the forces that fostered this integration process. This data fits into a gravity model that depicts an intensity of East and Southeast Asia regional trade superior to what gravity forces might predict. The first traces of raising regionalization coincided with the expansion of transit networks due to investments in transport infrastructure and low tariffs imposed by Western Powers in the 1860s and 1870s. Among the factors favoring this integration, another model demonstrates the existence of variables making these countries natural trading partners like low trade costs or demand complementarities that, according to Sugihara, persist until nowadays (Sugihara 2019).====Nevertheless, our results also show that the contribution of imperial policies to these raises in intraregional trade was more significant than those of the region's economic characteristics. The counterfactual would be that without imperial occupation, intra-Asian trade acceleration would have been smoother. The first acceleration of regional trade occurred thanks to transit networks created by the British around Hong Kong and Singapore, which were reinforced by their free trade policies and investment in infrastructure, although managed by Chinese merchants. Furthermore, the antithetical Japanese imperial policies consolidated integration in the interwar years. They established Empire-wide industrialization plans, created a discriminatory trade bloc, developed informal imperial links, and cooperated with local commercial networks across the region.====Moreover, Japanese ascendancy seems more significant than the British. Therefore, we structure the paper in the following manner: Section 2 summarizes the debate about the different determinants driving East and Southeast Asia regional integration across history. Then, section 3 will provide descriptive statistics about the evolution and direction of imports during the studied period and their main determinants, while Sections 4 and 5 describe the model employed and the characteristics of the newly constructed database. Finally, section 6 will bring the main results, and section 7 the conclusions.",Natural trading partners versus empires in East and Southeast Asia regional integration (1840-1938),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158321000630,30 November 2021,2021,Research Article,35.0

In this paper, we investigate such peer effects from exposure to elderly workers using the employee satisfaction survey of a Japanese firm. We show that, on average, elderly workers do not have significant peer effects on coworkers’ satisfaction. However, the effects are heterogeneous depending on the ability of elderly workers as measured by their wages, and the age and job levels of their peers. Namely, nonmanagerial workers, particularly those in their 50s, are more satisfied and coworkers in their 30s and 40s receive more training when they work with elderly workers. The positive effects are significant when the focal elderly workers come from other units rather than when they stay in the same units implying that the sharing of broad experience might mediate the effect. In contrast, the presence of elderly workers makes first-line managers feel that there is poor communication in the workplace.","The 2006 revision of the Elderly Employment Stabilization Law (EESL), making it obligatory for firms to secure the employment of workers aged between 60 and 65 years, significantly increased the employment of elderly workers in Japan. Yamamoto (2008) estimated the EESL revision effect using the Keio Household Panel Survey. From the difference-in-difference estimation results of the study, the treatment group, consisting of workers aged 60–62 years as of January 2007, showed a 12–14 percentage point higher employment rate than the control group. Kondo and Shigeoka (2017) also examined the effect using the Labour Force Survey. In this study, workers born in 1946, that is, the first cohort affected by the EESL revision, were the treatment group, and those born in 1945 were the control group. The study showed that the likelihood of the treatment group being employed at the ages of 60 and 61 increases by 2.4 and 3.2 percentage points, respectively (Kondo and Shigeoka, 2017, p.1024).====Even if many more elderly workers secured employment, the overall impact on total employment would be smaller if the elderly workers were substituted for young or female workers. In fact, several studies have examined the substitutability between elderly workers and other workers in the labor market. Using industry-level data, Ohta (2012) examined how a higher share of elderly workers affects the hiring rate of young workers. Since 2006, when the EESL revision came into effect, increased elderly worker employment has had a negative impact on the hiring rate of young workers, especially female workers, indicating their substitutability. Kondo (2016) evaluated how the employment of elderly workers affects the employment share of young workers, considering the ratio of full-time male employees aged 55–59 years to the total full-time male employees at the establishment level as the key independent variable. However, the study found no significantly negative correlation or evidence supporting their substitutability.====While the issue of substitutability in employment can have important policy implications, firm management needs to have a better understanding of the roles that can be assigned to the elderly and how they should be deployed in workplaces to maximize overall organizational productivity. Elderly workers are likely to have a broad range of skills and knowledge from the general to the firm-specific and from the technical to the contextual. At the same time, elderly workers whose skills have become obsolete and whose motivation tends to decline as they reach retirement age could have a negative impact on their peers. Thus, we need to understand the significance and heterogeneity of elderly workers’ peer effects to evaluate the potential productivity gain from retraining and assigning them efficiently.====In this study, we analyze how elderly workers affect their peers in the same workplace. That is, we examine whether elderly workers have positive or negative peer effects on other workers where peer effects should reflect elderly workers’ roles in the internal labor market and their abilities. Knowledge of which effect is greater can help us derive implications for the efficient allocation of elderly workers.====For our analysis, we use personnel records from a large-sized Japanese manufacturing company that we call ==== (hereafter C3P), a pseudonym used to conceal the identity of the firm. We examine how workers’ job satisfaction and their assessment of the workplace change when elderly workers are assigned as their colleagues. The combined rich panel dataset allows us to control for unobservable time-invariant worker and workplace characteristics.====Our main findings are threefold. First, we find, on average, that coworkers’ exposure to elderly workers when they are assigned to the workplace does not generally affect job satisfaction, workplace communication, or training. Second, we find that the effects are heterogeneous and depend on elderly workers’ wages, which we interpret as reflecting their abilities. Third, the effects vary depending on the characteristics of the coworkers working with elderly employees. In particular, the results differ significantly by age group and between nonmanagerial and managerial workers.====Previous studies have examined the peer effects of students and adolescents. Using 10th graders in each school taken from the National Education Longitudinal Survey as peer groups, Gaviria and Raphael (2001) found peer effects in the students’ propensity to engage in activities such as drug use and going to church, although they also showed significant endogeneity bias due to self-selection to schools. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health has an advantage in that researchers can identify adolescents’ peer groups because the questionnaire asks them to report the names of their friends. Several researchers have used the survey to show evidence of peer effects in eating habits (Fortin and Yazbeck, 2015) and academic achievement (Lin, 2010).====Although only a limited number of studies have examined peer effects of workers, they are growing in number. Falk and Ichino (2006) exogenously assigned workers to simple tasks in pairs or alone in a laboratory experiment and found clear evidence of peer effects that reduced differences in within-pair output, primarily by increasing the productivity of slower workers. Mas and Moretti (2009) studied the peer effect among supermarket registrars, who have incentives to free ride on the efforts of others because managers cannot continuously monitor their contribution. However, such free-riding is apparently eliminated by social pressure—workers were found to step up their effort when they work with productive peers, especially those with whom they frequently interact with during the same shift.====Chan et al. (2014) focused on the learning aspects of peer effects using the sales records in the cosmetic floor at a Chinese department store. They found that working with high-ability peers caused knowledge spillovers to raise the long-term productivity growth of new employees. The study also identifies the process of knowledge spillover through active teaching and observation.====On the other hand, a few studies have found evidence of negative peer effects. Murphy (2019), for example, exploits a natural experiment in the U.S. Army, which relaxed its policy of granting enlistment waivers for health, aptitude, and criminal background in 2005. The study found that interactions with those granted “morality waivers” had a significantly negative influence on the behavior of soldiers in the same company in terms of the likelihood of misconduct.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

For top managers of small family firms, one of the key long-run situations to consider is whether their children will succeed their parents’ business after their retirement – family succession. However, while there is a large body of literature on the impact of family succession on firm performance (e.g. Bennedsen et al. (2007)), little is known empirically about the expectations and behavior of managers ==== to succession. In particular, how do managers’ expectations about family succession affect the managers’ current behavior and firm performance? In theory, the dynasty model of Barro (1974) that assumes parents’ altruism for their children implies that the managers will exert more effort to improve the firm’s value if they anticipate that the business will be taken over by their children, rather than being succeeded by others or having no successors. Conversely, under the selfish life-cycle model, where managers care only about their own lifetime utility, such incentives would be weak. Although managers’ altruism for their children is considered as one of the key characteristics of family firms in a large body of family business management literature (e.g., Schulze et al. (2001)), there is little empirical evidence showing the causal effect of how the expectations about succession by children affect the current business performance of the managers.====In this study, we investigate how managers’ expectations about future family succession affect business performance using a newly constructed dataset of owner-managed small businesses in Japan. To identify the causal effect, we use the sex of the top manager’s first-born child as an instrumental variable (IV). While the sex of the first-born child is randomly determined by nature and unlikely to influence the firm’s performance directly, we find that it significantly affects the manager’s expectation that his own child will succeed in the business.==== For the nature of this instrument, we focus on the impact of family succession (i.e. succession by a family member of the owner), rather than succession in general or a sell-out option as a means to keep the business after the owner’s retirement. For Japanese SMEs, family succession is the most common pattern of business succession, and mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are rare. Among Japanese SMEs’ business transfers, 61.1% of the transfers took place among relatives, and only 4.5% were through M&A, according to the estimation based on a congressional research report of the Secretariat of the House of Representatives of Japan (2019).====We find that the existence of a potential family successor has a large positive effect on profit, especially among businesses with hired employees. Our results indicate that an increase in the expectation of family succession by one standard deviation raises profit margins by 25%. In exploring the channels, we find that the presence of a potential family successor induces business expansion and managers’ actions to enhance performance, such as improving efficiency in production and sales operations and investing in information technology (IT). The results are robust even if we focus on the sample of managers with small children, implying that the direct effect of children through their involvement in the business is not likely to explain the results. Our findings suggest that the performance at the time of retirement could also be driven by managers’ past expectations regarding succession/exit, even though many Japanese SME managers point to underperformance as the main reason for business closure at the time of their retirement (Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, 2019).====Our study is closely related to three strands of literature. The first strand examines who inherits family businesses. La Porta et al. (1999) and Claessens et al. (2000) document that there are more dynastic family firms in countries where the legal protections for stakeholders are weak. Children whose parents run businesses tend to become entrepreneurs.==== Furthermore, sons were more inclined than daughters to become successors in many countries (Ahrens et al. (2015); Niittykangas and Tervo (2005); Aldrich and Kim (2006)). Firms with stronger family control and influence are likely to select the first-born child as the next leader (Calabró et al., 2018).====The second strand of related literature documents the empirical relationships between the types of successors and changes in the firm’s performance before and after succession. There is a growing body of research documenting what types of successors improve firm performance after family or non-family succession (Chen et al. (2016); Luan et al. (2018); Cucculelli and Micucci (2008); Saito (2008); Perez-Gonzalez (2006); Lee et al. (2003)). Most of these studies find that incoming family CEOs harm performance relative to professional CEOs around the succession (Bennedsen et al. (2007); Perez-Gonzalez (2006); Cucculelli and Micucci (2008); Chang and Shim (2015)). Similarly, Mehrotra et al. (2013) find succession by a son-in-law enhances return on assets compared to that by biological sons. Cao et al. (2015) point out that the one-child policy in China could lead to a decrease in companies’ desire to be listed as well as in re-investment and R&D, following the decline in the number of children. Bennedsen et al. (2007) use data on Danish succession cases and show that (1) succession is 32.7% more likely to be within the family if the sex of the departing CEO’s first-born child is male; (2) the sex of the child has little effect on the profit margin, firm age, firm size, number of children, marital status, and divorce rate at the time of the CEO’s transition; and (3) family succession deteriorates the firms’ post-succession performance when compared to succession by unrelated persons.====The aforementioned literature examines what types of successors achieve better post-succession outcomes by using the data of firms that were succeeded in the end. Our study’s goal is different from these studies in that we investigate the causal effects of ==== about successions on pre-succession firm performance. Importantly, unlike previous studies, our data are not restricted to firms that will be succeeded in the end but also include firms that will eventually exit. Without such data, it is difficult to identify the effect of expectations about future succession on pre-succession firm performance.====Finally, our study is related to the growing empirical literature on firm managers’ expectations (Coibion et al. (2018); Bachmann and Elstner (2015); Bloom et al. (2018)). In particular, a few recent studies analyze the empirical relationship between firms’ expectations and firm outcomes. Using US survey data on CFOs’ expectations, Gennaioli et al. (2015) show that investment plans and realizations are well explained by expectations about earnings growth. In a related effort, Massenot and Pettinicchi (2018) and Tanaka et al. (2020) use firm survey data in Germany and Japan to show that firms’ forecasts of future growth are associated with investment, employment, profit, and productivity in the subsequent year. As far as we know, our study is the first to examine the effect of managers’ expectations about family succession on (pre-succession) business outcomes.====Japan is a suitable setting for this study for three reasons. First, there is a persistent primogeniture custom in Japan. In business successions, male children are more likely to succeed in their parents’ business than female children. This condition allows us to use the sex of the first-born child as an IV. Second, parents’ manipulation of their child’s sex by altering the chromosome or having an abortion is likely to be very limited in Japan. This feature validates the key assumption for IV. Lastly, Japan is the world’s fastest-aging society, with growing importance being accorded to research on SMEs’ succession decisions.==== In 1950, the population aging rate in Japan was only 4.9% before it rapidly rose to 26.6% in 2015.==== Top managers are also aging. In Japan, over 70% of all managers are 55 years old or older, while the corresponding figure in the United States is over 40% (the US Census Bureau; Kodama and Li (2018)). In tandem with managers’ aging, the number of business closures triggered by retirement is growing and amounted to about six times the number of bankruptcies in 2018, even though the number of bankruptcies was almost the same as in 2000 (Research, Research). To prevent high-performing firms from exiting the market due to retiring managers, the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency in Japan promotes M&A matching and exemptions of inheritance tax and gift tax.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We describe our data and the empirical strategy in the next section. Sections 3 and 4 report the main empirical results and discuss the underlying mechanisms.

Under a constant total number of immigrants, it focused on the optimal period for an immigration policy that maximized per-capita utility. Simulation results, based on an extended lifecycle simulation model with endogenous fertility, showed that a longer period immigration policy increased the future population and enhanced long-run economic growth. Conversely, a shorter period immigration policy enhanced economic growth in earlier years but less so in the long run. This study found that an optimal duration for an immigration policy, under the standard parameter settings for Japan, was nine years; this finding was derived through reconciling the merits and demerits between shorter and longer period immigration policies.","Japan's population is currently aging at an unprecedented speed for a developed nation, and the population is also simultaneously decreasing, which has become one of Japan's most important problems. Figure 1 presents old-age dependency ratio projections (defined as the ratio of the population aged 65 or older against that of 20–64) for five advanced countries. The ratio will rise sharply and stay at an elevated level throughout the century. As the figure shows, the speed and magnitude of demographic aging in Japan are remarkable, even compared to other countries that face similar challenges. Thus, the projections of future fertility rates and survival probabilities in Japan indicate a severe reduction in both the total and working-age population. Regarding the problems associated with aging and depopulating societies, increases in childcare allowances are often discussed as an effective countermeasure. Another method for mitigating rapid population decreases in Japan is an enhanced immigration policy.====In reality, advanced countries such as the United States (U.S.) and Germany have accepted many immigrants and have used the immigrant population to maintain their population level or promote economic growth. The recent inflows of immigrants and foreign workers into Japan are illustrated in Figure 2.==== According to the data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2021a), the permanent inflows of foreigners were 132,000 people in 2019; their share of the total population was only 0.1%. Conversely, people categorized as “foreign workers” in Japan were rapidly increasing and their inflow reached to 1.72 million people in 2020 (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare 2011-2021). From the general viewpoint of the world, however, Japan already had an inflow of many “immigrants.” The inflow of foreign population (“immigrants”) in Japan was 519,683 people in 2018 (OECD, 2021b), which shows that Japan received the fourth-largest immigrants among the OECD Member countries. Moreover, Japan had a total of 2,928,940 foreign residents in 2020 (Immigration Services Agency of Japan, 2021), which was 2.32% of its total population (i.e., 126 million people).====Next, we consider effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which is affecting the entire world, on an aging and depopulating Japan. The pandemic continues to have severe impacts on the Japanese economy. According to Kawai (2021), the most serious impact of the pandemic on Japan is the further reduction of birth rates and acceleration of depopulation. In reality, in 2019, there were only 865,239 births in Japan (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 2020), which was substantially lower than those of the previous year by 5.8%. This suggests that, in 2019, just before the coronavirus pandemic, the number of births was low, implying an already existing critical situation. In 2020, the births further decreased to 840,832 (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 2021), which was the lowest on record since statistics were first compiled in 1899. Moreover, the number of the couples who married in 2020 was also only 525,490 (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 2021), which was the lowest after the World War Ⅱ and substantially lower than that of the previous year by 73,517. Furthermore, infectious disease control measures (such as increase in teleworking, mask wearing, social distancing, and avoiding dining in big crowds) would decrease opportunities of the encounter and close contact between individuals.====Therefore, the decrease in the number of marriages and births will continue in Japan. If we consider the period from pregnancy to childbearing, real serious effects of the coronavirus pandemic will gradually emerge from now. Hence, probably, the number of births in 2021 will dramatically decrease to less than 800,000. Kawai (2021) suggests the possibility of approximately 750,000 births in Japan in 2021; because the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (2017) projects that Japanese births will continue to decrease and reach 750,000 births by 2039, the decrease in the number of births may occur much earlier than the 2039 estimation. The substantial decrease of births will reduce the population of young generations and accelerate labor force shrinkage. Thus, to cover a shortage of labor forces, the necessity of an “immigration policy” will rise after a temporary reset of the entry prohibition (or restriction) on immigrant caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Countermeasures for impending demographic issues and shrinking labor force problems in Japan are insufficient despite their urgency and importance. Hence, to account for a labor force shortage, an “immigration policy” would be an important option in Japan.====However, things may be not so easy. Although the inflow of foreign workers was steadily increasing before the occurrence of the coronavirus pandemic, once the pandemic settles, many foreigners may no longer choose Japan as a workplace for the following two reasons. First, Japan seems to treat foreign workers as simply cheap and convenient labor forces; the treatment of foreign workers in Japan has been often criticized. For example, the Skill Training System for Foreigners is often criticized for the reason that, apart from an original significance of the system, foreigners are treated as merely cheap labor forces. The political economy in terms of an immigration policy is often a sensitive topic to be discussed because historically Japan has been insular concerning immigration; hence, the Japanese government currently continues to take a stance of keeping no immigration policy for certain political reasons. However, the government must improve the treatment of foreign workers, and it should regard many of the “foreign workers” as “immigrants,” according to the general international viewpoint. By doing so, they should be made eligible for public pensions and health insurances. Second, the real wage in Japan has hardly increased over the past three decades, unlike most advanced countries. In terms of real wages, Japan is no longer an attractive country for foreigners as a workplace. Thus, the necessity of an “immigration policy” seems to increase in the current Japanese situation.====During our research, we used the lifecycle general equilibrium simulation model of overlapping generations, developed by Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983a, 1983b) and similarly applied in Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), Auerbach et al==== (1989), Altig et al==== (2001), Homma et al==== (1987), Ihori et al. (2006, 2011), Okamoto (2005, 2010, 2013), and so on. Okamoto (2020) extended the simulation model to introduce the number of children freely chosen by households, thus incorporating endogenous fertility and future demographic dynamics.====In 2014, the Japanese government stated that it would consider a guest worker program that would bring 200,000 foreign workers to Japan annually over 10 years, eventually accumulating a total of 2 million guest workers. To investigate the quantitative effects of an enhanced immigration policy, we extended the simulation model to freely set or choose the numbers and timings of immigrant inflow. Alternative immigration policies have different durations and annual numbers of immigrants. This study analyzes the quantitative effects that increased immigration to Japan might have on the future population and per-capita household welfare. It specifically focuses on the optimal immigration policy duration based on a constant total number of immigrants (with equally distributed immigrants each year). Here it should be noted that this result is obtained under the current level of government childcare subsidies and the assumption that the immigrants are completely identical to Japanese natives.====Regarding government childcare subsidies, in 2014, the Japanese government set a target population of approximately 100 million in 50 years, whereas the population projected by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (2017) is to reach only 88 million in 2065. This was the first time in history that the government formally expressed a numerical target for the future population, revealing a sense of impending crisis. To realize the ====, the government began devising countermeasures for the falling birth rate. When subsidies increase, the optimal period for immigration policy may change. Therefore, we will examine the effects of alternative immigration policies in a situation where child allowances increase.====Although our baseline simulation results are obtained based on the assumption that the immigrants have completely the same features as Japanese natives, immigrants to Japan tend to have higher fertility, a shorter life expectancy, and lower labor productivity than Japanese natives; these three characteristics of immigrants may change the optimal period for the immigration policy. Therefore, we will evaluate the effects of each atypical characteristic.====Next, we explain the validity of simulation scenarios considered in this study. Because an explicit immigration policy plan has not been discussed since 2014, this study essentially considers the immigration policy plan announced by the government in 2014. Moreover, the original plan was to consider the guest (or foreign) worker program; however, this study considers immigration policies. This is because, as aforementioned, the Japanese government needs to improve the treatment of guest workers and accept many of them as the “immigrants” who can continue to live in Japan without a time limit and are eligible for public pensions and health insurances.====Additionally, we state the relevance of exploring an optimal duration of immigration policy under a constant total number of immigrants (with equally distributed immigrants each year). Around 2008, the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan proposed an explicit immigration policy to receive 10 million immigrants in the next 50 years with an annual 200,000 immigrant flow. Further, in 2014, the Japanese government stated that it would consider a guest worker program that would bring 200,000 foreign workers to Japan annually over 10 years, eventually accumulating 2 million guest workers. These plans set the duration of immigration policy as 50 or 10 years, but these durations seem to be convenient round figures, not based on solid foundations. Both Shimasawa and Oguro (2010) and Imrohoroglu et al. (2017), who analyzed the quantitative effects of an immigration policy or a guest worker program for Japan using a lifecycle dynamic simulation model, also seem to consider just round number of years to leave off (such as 10 or 30 years, and eternally) for the period of an immigration policy or a guest worker program in Japan. Nonetheless, when an immigration policy program is concretely considered and designed, the duration or period of the immigration policy is fairy important for the following reason: even if the total number of immigrants is the same for an immigration policy, different durations would bring about different outcomes, thus creating different impacts on the future population and per-capita welfare.====Based on a constant total number of immigrants, a shorter period immigration policy brings more immigrants in earlier years, thereby producing more children and descendants in the short run. Thus, the policy may also result in a larger total population and higher per-capita welfare in the long run. Conversely, a longer period immigration policy brings immigrants in later years too. In a depopulating society like Japan, immigrants in later years are more valuable because of their higher share in the total population, which may lead to more favorable outcomes on the future population and welfare in the long run. Therefore, different durations of an immigration policy have substantially different impacts on the economy not only in a short run but also in a long run. This shows that exploring an optimal duration for immigration policy based on demographic and economic grounds is important. Hence, it is meaningful and crucial to investigate the effects of the immigration policy with different durations on future demography and welfare using an extended lifecycle overlapping generations model with endogenous fertility.====Finally, our study also introduces an additional government institution, the Lump Sum Redistribution Authority (LSRA). The LSRA method is used in previous studies such as Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), Nishiyama and Smetters (2005), and Okamoto (2020). An optimal duration for immigration policy is led by an optimization via the LSRA method, and the per-capita utility is calculated for all individuals, including the current and future generations. Alternative immigration policies generally improve the welfare of some generations but reduce the welfare of others. If combined with redistribution from the winning to losing generations, such policies may offer the prospect of ====. Without implementing intergenerational redistribution, however, potential efficiency gains or losses cannot be estimated. Therefore, like Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987) and Nishiyama and Smetters (2005), we introduce LSRA as a hypothetical government institution. This distinguishes potential efficiency gains or losses from possible offsetting changes in the welfare of different generations. To isolate pure efficiency gains or losses, we consider simulation cases via LSRA transfers where alternative immigration policies are implemented. The introduction of LSRA transfers enables us to examine policy proposals from a long-term perspective, considering not only the welfare of current generations but also of future generations, which will allow us to present concrete and useful policy proposals.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the literature related to our study; Section 3 identifies the basic model applied in the simulation analysis; Section 4 explains the method and assumptions of the simulation analysis; Section 5 evaluates the simulation findings and discusses policy implications; and Section 6 summarizes and concludes the study.",Immigration policy and demographic dynamics: Welfare analysis of an aging Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158321000472,11 September 2021,2021,Research Article,43.0

This study uses parcel-level data on single-family houses in the municipality of Toshima in Tokyo, Japan, to examine determinants of the occurrence and reutilization of vacant houses. The data reveal that, conditional on land prices, houses with restricted and costly redevelopment opportunities are more likely to become vacant. The results suggest that owners with such properties disregard the redevelopment potential and, as a result, tend to have a high reservation price relative to the market value. Consequently, owners face difficulty finding a transaction partner and even become reluctant to engage in a deal (i.e., they withdraw from the market). The results also suggest that revitalization of the neighborhood community may contribute to activating vacant houses. Local governments can use an empirical assessment such as this to implement efficient measures by targeting houses that have a high probability of becoming and remaining vacant.","Unattended vacant houses can cause various problems in a neighborhood, such as by damaging the landscape and increasing the risks of building collapse and arson; they can also lead to poor sanitation resulting from illegal dumping and parasitic animals and can become breeding grounds for crime. Such negative externalities of housing vacancies can be serious, especially in high-density residential districts. A number of previous empirical studies have detected the presence of negative externalities in metropolitan areas (Awazu, 2014; Cui and Walsh, 2015; Ellen et al., 2013; Mikelbank, 2008; Paredes and Skidmore, 2017; Sadayuki et al., 2020; Spader et al., 2016; Whitaker and Fitzpatrick, 2013). Another problem with housing vacancies is their nonnegligible land-use opportunity cost, which could be covered if vacant properties were utilized in some fashion (Shimizu et al., 2004; Suzuki and Asami, 2016). Quite a few developed countries have already been experiencing high vacancy rates, including Japan (13.6% as of 2018), the United States (11.5% as of 2017), Australia (10.5% as of 2016), and France (8.4% as of 2018), according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2019). Preventing excess housing vacancies is a crucial consideration globally, as the population ages and population decreases continue to make issues surrounding housing vacancies more prominent around the world.====The vacancy or occupancy status of housing changes during the following two events: (1) an occupied house becomes vacant if no one purchases, inherits, or utilizes the property when the owner leaves the house, and (2) a vacant house becomes nonvacant when it is purchased or rented, utilized in a different manner from a residential house (e.g., a café, a guest house, a general store), or torn down for a different land-use purpose (e.g., reconstructing a new building, building a parking lot). Therefore, (1) preventing occupied houses from becoming vacant and (2) promoting the reutilization of vacant houses are two known keys to addressing housing vacancies. In either case, it is necessary to investigate the causes of housing vacancies to determine effective measures. Some studies have analyzed the factors that contribute to housing abandonment and vacancies by looking at house prices and property tax systems (Arsen, 1992; Bender, 1979; Scafidi et al., 1998; Segú, 2020; White, 1986) and others by looking at the spatial distribution (Morckel, 2013, 2014a, 2014b; Nishiura and Kobayashi, 2017; Sakamoto and Yokohari, 2016) and housing and neighborhood attributes (Baba and Hino, 2019; Kim et al., 2016) of abandoned and vacant houses.====Our study analyzes parcel-level data on single-family houses in one municipality in Tokyo Prefecture and examines how housing and neighborhood attributes relate to the status of housing vacancies. More specifically, by employing a probit regression analysis, (1) we first investigate determinants of the occurrence of housing vacancies by comparing houses that were vacant in 2016 with houses that were sold in the same year; (2) we then investigate determinants of the reutilization of vacant houses by comparing vacant houses and nonvacant properties in 2016 among houses that were vacant in 2011.====This study makes three main contributions to the existing body of related literature. First, among many studies on the occurrence of vacant houses using parcel-level data (Akiyama et al., 2019; Hillier et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2016; Scafidi et al., 1998), this study is the first attempt to investigate the reutilization of vacant houses by using parcel-level panel data. Although questionnaire surveys of owners of vacant houses about their awareness of reutilization have been used in other research (Kondo and Togawa, 2018; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism [MLIT], 2014, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism 2020a, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism 2020b; Suzuki and Hino, 2018), an ex post analysis of the reutilization of vacant houses using parcel-level data, which is only possible with multiperiod surveys of vacant houses, has not yet been performed.==== The field surveys for this research were conducted during 2011 and 2016 in the municipality of Toshima in Tokyo, Japan, and covered all existing single-family houses in the target areas. In Japan, given the expectation of an increasing number of vacant houses along with a decreasing population, the importance of reutilizing vacant houses has drawn public attention (MLIT, 2019; Ueda, 2015). This study provides the first empirical findings on what types of vacant houses were reutilized or continuously left vacant.====Second, to investigate the occurrence of vacant houses, we use transacted houses for comparison instead of analyzing the spatial distribution among all existing houses in the study area. By doing so, we are able to exclude samples of “normal” houses in which residents continuously resided during the study period, which enables us to focus on houses that previous owners had recently left or planned to leave. This sampling selection allows us to better understand the mechanism by which houses became vacant compared with the previous literature examining parcel-level data targeting all housing samples from the population (Akiyama et al., 2019; Baba et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2016; Kitajima et al., 2019) or neighborhood-level vacancy rates (Kondo and Togawa, 2018; Nishiura and Kobayashi, 2017; Oda et al., 2018; Sakamoto and Yokohari, 2016; Yamashita and Morimoto, 2015).====Third, we introduce the predicted land price in the probit regression analysis to disentangle the owners’ decision-making behavior behind the occurrence of vacant housing and reutilization. Although accumulations of parcel-level data and research on housing vacancies have significantly improved the prediction of housing vacancies in terms of spatial distribution and housing attributes, the existing empirical literature seems to provide insufficient discussion of the relationship between the empirical findings and owners’ inherent decision-making process that leads to housing vacancies. The distribution of owners’ and potential buyers’ (or tenants’) reservation prices plays a central role in determining the probability of transaction and thus the duration of housing vacancies (Albercht et al., 2007, 2016; Novy-Marx, 2009; Suzuki and Asami, 2020; Wheaton, 1990; Williams, 1995). A house stays vacant if the owner's reservation price is too high. This may happen for various reasons, such as a current owner's strong emotional attachment to the house, an expectation that the house will be inherited by his or her child, a reluctance to engage in a series of deals, and regulations that restrict future land use. However, in an empirical setting, examining the role of the reservation price is challenging because it is unobservable and is influenced by various socioeconomic and institutional conditions. In our study, by introducing the predicted land price as a control variable in the estimation, we estimate the impacts of housing attributes on the vacancy status that are independent from the effect of the land price, which allows us to indirectly investigate the difference between the owners’ reservation price and the market price.====The factors that contribute to housing vacancies and the extent to which each factor affects vacancies can differ by region. In many Western cities where people often use real estate as collateral, the abandonment of ownership rights due to tax delinquency or mortgage default is a typical cause of housing vacancies (White, 1986; Arsen, 1992; O'Flaherty, 1990; Scafidi et al., 1998; Immergluck and Smith, 2006). The decline in domestic industry has also contributed to population outflow in some cities, including Detroit in the US (Steinmetz, 2009) and cities in the northern England (Keenan et al., 1999; Couch and Cockes, 2013). In Japan, on the other hand, the advancement of an aging society nationwide with a falling birthrate is the main contributor to increasing vacant houses rather than financial distress or industrial structural change. Therefore, the situations and issues of vacant houses in Japan differ between provincial areas facing a significantly decreasing population and metropolitan areas maintaining relatively high housing demand. Given such variations in regional characteristics both internationally and intranationally, empirical investigations of vacant houses at the local level are beneficial to address region-specific vacancy problems (Haase et al., 2014; Wakabayashi, 2020). In this sense, empirical findings from this research may be more applicable to metropolitan areas in which most owners are not financially constrained. However, this study intends to go beyond region-specific interpretation by examining reservation prices to disentangle individual decision-making mechanisms that lead to housing vacancies.====Our results illuminate that, conditional on the land price, a vacant house tends to be made of wood, faces a narrow road and frontage, and has a small lot compared with a transacted house. The results indicate that houses with restricted and costly redevelopment opportunities resulting from the building code are more likely to be vacant. We argue that owners of houses with such insufficient conditions for future redevelopment tend to overestimate the market value of their own properties, which leads to a higher offering price than what potential buyers are willing to pay, resulting in lengthy vacancies. We also find that among houses that were vacant in 2011, a house is more likely to remain vacant in 2016 when the lot size is small, the building was already dilapidated in 2011, and the neighborhood has experienced a greater decline in residents’ rate of participation in the neighborhood association. In addition to the significance of redevelopment opportunities, this result suggests that community activation may play an important role in vacant-house reutilization.====The paper is structured as follows. We review the related literature in section 2 and present data and estimation strategies in section 3. We then examine determinants of the occurrence of housing vacancies and the reutilization of vacant houses in section 4. Finally, we offer concluding remarks in section 5.","What types of houses remain vacant?

We address the endogeneity concerns on the measurement errors of the study variables of margin ratio and tariffs.

However, the study also found that a tariff reduction lowers the margin ratio of wholesalers who procure their products from domestic producers.","Literature on international economics has focused on the impact of tariff reduction or elimination on prices, or “tariff pass-through,” over the long term. A tariff pass-through is critical for considering the benefits of trade liberalization, the beneficiaries, and the extent. In general, goods move from a producer in a foreign country (i.e., an exporter) to a household in a home country through wholesalers, retailers, and other local players (e.g., distribution services providers). In this flow of goods, for example, if a foreign producer captures all the rent from tariff reduction by increasing its producer price by the same amount as the tariff reduction (i.e., the tariff reduction is perfectly passed through to the producer price), consumers cannot enjoy the benefits arising from tariff reduction. Thus, to evaluate the benefits from trade liberalization, it is crucial to know how the rent from tariff reduction is distributed among players in the flow, that is, foreign producers, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, and other local players.==== Thus, the tariff pass-through rate, which indicates how prices are established by each player in response to a 1 % change in tariffs, is a useful measure.====Researchers have quantified the tariff pass-through for trade and consumer prices. An empirical study on import prices by Feenstra (1989) examined the tariff pass-through for US imports from Japan using product-level import data. Similar analyses were conducted by Rezitis and Brown (1999), Chang and Winters (2002), and Mallick and Marques (2008). By employing firm-level export data, Ludema and Yu (2016) and Görg ==== (2017) investigated the tariff pass-through in the cases of US and Hungarian exports, respectively. Several studies examined the effects of tariff reduction through preferential or regional trade agreements (RTAs) (Ozden and Sharma, 2006; Cirera, 2014). These studies have found an incomplete tariff pass-through. Further, Porto (2006), Nicita (2009), Han ==== (2016), and Ural Marchand (2012) investigated the pass-through in consumer prices using household survey data. These studies found a drop in consumer prices through tariff reductions. Cavallo ==== (2021) used retailers’ online prices to study the tariff pass-through for retail/consumer prices. They found that the rise in tariffs reduced retailers’ margins and did not significantly alter consumer prices.====This study empirically examines the tariff pass-through in wholesaling in the case of Japan. As mentioned earlier, several studies have investigated the tariff pass-through from the perspective of producers and consumers. However, no studies have ever empirically explored tariff pass-through from the wholesalers’ perspective although they are one of the key players in the flow of goods. This gap in literature is addressed by employing firm-level data on Japanese wholesalers. Indeed, the wholesale sector has accounted for a non-negligible share of the national gross domestic product. In 2015, for example, it was 8 % in Japan (Cabinet Office) and 6 % in the United States (Bureau of Economic Analysis). These shares are larger than or as large as those in the retail sector (6 % in both Japan and the United States). In particular, this study examines the effects of tariffs on wholesalers’ margin ratios. Margin ratio is defined as “sales minus procurements” over sales.==== Owing to data limitation, this ratio and the tariff rates can be computed at a firm level rather than at a firm-product level. Therefore, the instrumental variable (IV) method is used to address the endogeneity issue on the measurement errors of the firm-level margin ratio and tariff rates. This study examines by how much importing wholesalers raise their margin ratio against a tariff reduction.====Pass-through in wholesaling differs qualitatively from that for home-country consumers and foreign producers (i.e., exporters). In the flow of transactions, producers and consumers are the first and last players, respectively. Therefore, the changes in producer and consumer prices directly indicate producers’ and consumers’ benefits, respectively, from shocks such as tariff changes. However, given that wholesalers are positioned in the middle of the flow, the shocks affect their procurement as well as their sales prices. Thus, in the analysis of tariff pass-through in wholesaling, the change in sales prices ==== procurement prices must be examined. This study examines the effects of tariffs on margin ratios because these ratios are one of the typical indicators of wholesalers’ performance used in the field of marketing research. Furthermore, researchers in economics have investigated margin ratios (e.g., Anderson ====, 2018). This study shows the effects on sales prices with respect to that on procurement prices by examining the effects on margin ratios. Then, to find the tariff pass-through for wholesaling, this study focuses on the aforementioned effects for ==== wholesalers.====In addition to these studies on tariff pass-through, the present study is related to at least three strands of literature. The first strand includes the theoretical, rather than empirical, studies on tariff pass-through in retailing (e.g., Richardson, 2004; Raff and Schmitt, 2009; 2012; 2016; Francois and Wooton, 2010; Cole and Eckel, 2018). In particular, Raff and Schmitt (2012) developed a model of international trade with heterogeneous retailers based on the results of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) and explored the effects of trade liberalization on the retail market structure. In their model, trade liberalization leads to lower consumer prices, not only through the standard pass-through effects but also by making the competition more difficult through the selection mechanism. Therefore, it reduces the markups of retailers who source goods domestically but raises the markups of retailers who engage in direct imports. There are perhaps no theoretical studies that focus on a tariff pass-through in wholesaling. However, these mechanisms, although they refer to retailing, may be useful for considering the tariff pass-through in wholesaling.====The second strand focuses on the exchange rate pass-through for wholesalers or retailers. Examples of relevant studies include Hellerstein (2008), Nakamura and Zerom (2010), Antoniades and Zaniboni (2016), and Berner, Birg, and Boddin (2016), and the results are heterogeneous. Hellerstein (2008) showed that foreign producers (i.e., exporters) receive larger rent from the variation of exchange rates than retailers and consumers. However, Nakamura and Zerom (2010) found that the pass-through exists almost entirely at the wholesale level. To summarize, the distribution of the rent arising from the changes in the exchange rate among the recipients differs across studies (e.g., for different countries and products). In this context, our study shows the existence of a ==== pass-through for ====. Importing wholesalers were found to significantly raise their margin ratio and, thus, their sales prices relative to procurement prices against the tariff reduction. On average, a 1 percentage point reduction in tariffs (e.g., 6.7 % to 5.7 %) raises the margin ratio by approximately 0.25 percentage points (e.g., 26.72 % or 0.2672 to 26.97 % or 0.2697). This rise is equivalent to the rise of relative sales prices to procurement prices by approximately 0.34 % (e.g., 1.3646 to 1.3693).====The third strand examines the firm-level performance of wholesalers and/or retailers in the context of international trade (e.g., Bernard ====, 2010; Meinen and Raff, 2018). For example, to examine how increase in consumer goods imports affects retail market performance and structure, Meinen and Raff (2018) investigated the performance of retailers in Denmark from 1999 to 2008. They found that retailers venture into imports have 8 % more sales, 6 % higher profits, and 2 % greater markups in the year they initiate importing compared with nonimporting retailers. The present study finds new evidence on the wholesalers’ margin ratio. For example, a tariff reduction was found to lower (raise) the margin ratio of wholesalers who procure their products from domestic (foreign) producers.====This study is presented as follows. Following the empirical framework designed to examine the tariff pass-through in wholesaling in Section 2, the estimation results are presented in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 presents the conclusions.",Tariff Pass-through in Wholesaling: Evidence from Firm-level Data in Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158321000435,19 August 2021,2021,Research Article,45.0

Population aging has a positive impact on the average savings rate when the working-age population is large, it but has a negative impact when the working-age population decreases. Our empirical results, based on prefecture-level panel data, support the theoretical implication. After the mid-1990s, the working-age population declined, and the retired age population increased in many prefectures. As a result, population aging, which had a positive effect on the regional savings rate until the mid-1990s, came to have a negative effect thereafter. The empirical results suggest that in rural economies where deposits exceeded loans in the past, deposits are expected to decline due to the aging of society, resulting in a shortage of funds in the near future.","In Japan, the rapidly declining and aging population is a growing concern to achieve sustained economic growth. The demographic change reduces potential growth not only by decreasing the labor force but also by changing people's savings behavior. Since savings are the ultimate source of funds in financial markets, available funds may shrink in the economy when savings decrease. To the extent that inter-regional capital flows are limited, demographic change has a serious impact on economic growth in rural areas, where declining and aging populations are growing rapidly. This study examines the impact of the declining and aging population on the regional flow of funds using Japanese prefecture-level data.====To the extent that the life cycle hypothesis holds, middle-aged households have positive savings, while retired-age households have negative savings. Empirical evidence also suggests that the savings rates of working households are much higher than those of retired households. For example, according to the ==== by the Statistics Bureau of Japan in 2019, working households’ savings rate (≡ 1 − consumption/disposable income) is 38.5% for people under the age of 40, 34.6% for people 40–50, and 20.1% for people 60 years and older. In contrast, retired households’ savings rate is -15.7% for those 60–64 years old, -13.4% for those 65–74 years old, and -6.8% for those 75 years and older. This implies that the average savings rate in the economy is likely to decline when the working-age population decreases and the retired-age population increases.====However, as Auclert et al. (2020) pointed out, it is worthwhile to note that the effects of population aging vary depending on demographic structures. When young people have a longer life expectancy, they have more incentive to save. Under the pay-as-you-go pension system, they also save more when the ratio of the old to the total population increases. It is thus likely that population aging has a positive impact on the average savings rate in the region when the population of the young generation is large. However, when the population of young people is smaller than that of old people, negative savings of the old dominate the positive savings of the young. In this case, population aging has a negative impact on the average savings rate in the region when the population of the young generation decreases. In the following analysis, we empirically examine the validity of the theoretical implications.====By using prefecture-level panel data in Japan, we explore the impact of declining working-age population and increasing retired-age population on the savings rates, the investment–savings balance, and the loan-to-deposit ratio in the region. Regional data in Japan are ideal for our analysis because the population growth rate varies widely among regions. The declining aging population was less conspicuous before the early 1990s. However, they were more conspicuous in rural areas than in urban areas after the mid-1990s. Various structural problems associated with demographic changes have become serious in rural areas. Therefore, comparing prefectures with and without declining populations is useful in considering the impact of the declining and aging population on the regional flow of funds.====Japan consists of 47 prefectures. These prefectures are usually classified into eight regions: Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kinki, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu.==== In Hokkaido, Tohoku, Shikoku, and Chugoku, the population began to decline in the second half of the 1980s, and the rate of decline is expected to accelerate in the 2020s. In contrast, in the southern Kanto region, where the Tokyo metropolitan area is located, the population is expected to increase until the first half of the 2020s and remain at a high level in the 2020s. In other urban areas (North Kanto, Chubu, and Kinki), the population increased until around 2010 and remained at a high level until around the 2020s. Since the mid-1990s, while the population has continued to increase in metropolitan areas, the number of prefectures with an accelerating population decline has increased significantly in rural areas.====Fig. 1 shows the population growth rates of 47 prefectures from 1975 to 1995 and from 1995 to 2019. The average rate of population growth from 1975 to 1995 was 12.2%. In contrast, the average population growth rate from 1995 to 2019 was only 0.5%. From 1995 to 2019, the population growth rate fell below -10% in 14 prefectures, while only three prefectures (Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Okinawa) had population growth rates exceeding 10%. This suggests a dramatic structural change in regional population growth around the mid-1990s. The difference between rural and urban areas is useful in exploring how demographic changes affect the regional flow of funds in Japan.====In the following sections, we examine the structural changes that occurred in Japan's regional savings rates, the investment–savings balance, and the loan–deposit ratio around the mid-1990s using prefecture-level panel data. In Japan, the working age population was large in each prefecture until the mid-1990s. However, after the mid-1990s, the working-age population decreased, and the elderly population increased in many prefectures. To the extent that the life cycle hypothesis holds, the relationship between demographic structures and asset accumulation is likely to have changed dramatically before and after the mid-1990s.====A large number of studies have explored the impact of declining and aging populations on economic growth (e.g., Bloom et al., 2011; Maestas et al., 2016; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017; Eggertsson e al., 2019; Lee and Shin, 2019; Han and Lee, 2020). Existing studies investigate the effects on the Japanese economy because an unprecedented decline and aging population is a serious concern. Several studies examine the effects on Japan's labor markets (e.g., Abe, 2018; Kitao and Mikoshiba, 2020), Japan's social security systems (e.g., Kato, 2018; Miyazato, 2020), and Japan's fiscal sustainability (e.g., Faruqee et al., 2003; Sakuragawa and Sakuragawa, 2020).====A substantial number of studies also explore the impact of declining and aging populations on savings rates and financial markets (e.g., Arslanalp et al., 2019; Horioka and Terada-Hagiwara, 2012). In Japan, Horioka (2010) finds that there has been a sharp increase in the dissavings of retired people since 2000. By contrast, Iwaisako and Okada (2012) show that the decline in the household savings rate accelerated sharply after the domestic banking crisis in 1997/98 but decelerated from around 2004/05. Niimi and Horioka (2019) suggest that retired elderly people decumulate their wealth more slowly than predicted. Ikeda and Saito (2014) show that population aging lowers the real interest rate in Japan. However, few studies have investigated the impact of the declining and aging population on the regional flow of funds in Japan.====In Japan, the population decline and depth of aging are more serious in rural areas than in urban areas, which has caused several structural problems. Fukuda and Okumura (2020) point out that because of the declining population, economies of agglomeration disappeared in poorer regions more dramatically. Harimaya (2018) points out that the number of regional banks has been too high and that the potential cost savings from bank mergers are large. However, previous studies rarely discuss a structural change in the regional flow of funds, which has important implications for the business environment of regional banks. In Japan, a surplus of funds is common in rural areas. However, as the declining and aging population progresses, a decline in deposits will eventually overtake the decline in loans. As a result, it is likely that regional banks will face a shortage of funds. Regional banks are required to drastically change their business models to meet new environments in Japan.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After presenting the theoretical model in Section 2, Section 3 presents an empirical framework to evaluate the effect of population aging on regional savings behavior. Sections 4 and 5 examine the effects on age-specific and average savings rates, respectively, in prefectures. Section 6 investigates the effect on the investment–savings balance. Sections 7 and 8 explore the effect on the loan–deposit ratio of the stock base and the flow base, respectively. Section 9 summarizes our main results and discusses their implications.","The aging society, savings rates, and regional flow of funds in Japan",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158321000447,19 August 2021,2021,Research Article,46.0
"Kawaguchi Daiji,Motegi Hiroyuki","Graduate School of Public Policy, Graduate School of Economics, and Center for Research and Education in Program Evaluation (CREPE), University of Tokyo, Japan,Recruit Co., Ltd, Japan","Received 26 March 2021, Revised 31 July 2021, Accepted 10 August 2021, Available online 14 August 2021, Version of Record 26 August 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjie.2021.101162,Cited by (11),This paper examines the characteristics of remote work using a unique Japanese survey dataset that provides information on engagement in remote work together with the specific job tasks and human resource management (HRM) characteristics workers face. We show that the opportunity to work remotely was more likely to be available to those engaged in non-routine tasks as well as to workers subject to HRM practices presupposing that worker performance is measurable. The implications of these findings for income transfer policies and management practices in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.,"Throughout 2020, the spread of COVID-19 and the implementation of social distancing policies have confined millions of workers to their homes. While primarily a public health measure, social distancing has had a profound economic impact, but its effect on the aggregate labor supply and any distributional consequences will be determined largely by the extent to which remote work is possible. Against this backdrop, there has been a heightened interest in better understanding which jobs can and are being performed remotely. Studies using job task descriptions to estimate the proportion of jobs that can technically be accomplished from home have arrived at numbers ranging from 37% in the US to 56% in Germany.====This study takes a different approach by documenting who actually worked from home just prior to the COVID-19 crisis and identifying their specific job characteristics. In contrast to the literature, this approach allows us to understand the conditions facilitating a remote work arrangement and to articulate any expected challenges as remote work expands. To accomplish this, we utilize a unique panel data set from Japan that includes job task characteristics and human resource management conditions. As of December 2019, 8% of Japanese workers worked outside of their official workplace, and while the prevalence of remote work does not vary much across industries, it does vary considerably across occupations. In particular, workers involved in non-routine and non-manual tasks and those employed under performance-based human resource management (HRM) practices are significantly more likely to engage in remote work. Together, these results indicate that workers engaging in manual or interactive tasks are less likely to work remotely, as previous studies have found, and also that the extent to which employers can prevent “shirking from home” by, for example, quantifying work output is a critical determinant in the adoption of remote work. We show that job task and HRM characteristics, which vary considerably within a given 2-digit occupation or 1-digit industry category, largely explain the remote work experience, conditioned on industry and occupation.====In addition, as the determinants of earnings and remote work potential are positively related, the burden of social distancing policies disproportionately falls on low income earners. For instance, while the 50% of consultants who worked remotely earned 6 million yen annually, the 10% of care workers who worked remotely earned only 2.8 million yen annually. More generally, those who worked remotely earned 23.4% more than non-remote workers. However, we find that remote workers did not earn more than non-remote workers when conditioned on observed job and demographic characteristics, which suggests that income transfer policies conditioned on observable characteristics or socioeconomic status would mitigate the disadvantage experienced by non-remote workers under the hardships caused by the pandemic.====Remote work increased from 8% in December 2019 to 14% in December 2020, and we further examine how the determinants of remote work evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic by examining the job characteristics associated with the increase in remote work using the latest wave of the panel survey implemented in December 2020. Exploiting the panel structure, we examine the impact of job characteristics on December 2019 on the engagement in remote work in December 2020, and find that as remote work expanded, workers engaging in interactive tasks, holding a university degree, and belonging to larger firms caught the wave, while workers engaging in manual tasks were left behind. Thus, the increase in remote work during COVID-19 exacerbated the pre-existing inequality.====Since the outbreak of COVID-19, numerous studies have investigated the potential for working remotely based on occupation. Dingel and Neiman (2020), for example, determine whether a job can be performed remotely from responses to an O*NET questionnaire on “work context” and “generalized work activities”. By aggregating feasibility according to the distribution of the 6-digit standard occupational classifications published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, they conclude that 37% of U.S. jobs can be performed from home.==== Using a similar mapping, Boeri et al. (2020) find that 24-31 % of jobs can be performed at home in major European countries, and Holgersen et al. (2021), who determine the potential for working remotely through detailed ISCO-08 job descriptions and the marginal distribution of occupations through online job advertisements, similarly find that 36% of jobs in Norway can be performed from home. Meanwhile, Alipour et al. (2020) find from employee surveys that 56% of jobs in Germany can be performed from home. Finally, Brussevich et al. (2020) and Hatayama et al. (2020) independently calculate the possibility of remote work for more than 50 countries based on task characteristics recorded in the OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) and find that per capita GDP and prevalence of remote work are positively associated. They also report that women, college graduates, and salaried and regular-contract workers have jobs that are more amenable to working from home than the average worker.====In addition to these studies of the ==== for remote work based on occupation, research appears on the proportion of the workforce that is actually working from home in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. Based on a survey conducted from April 1-5, 2020, Brynjolfsson et al. (2020) find that 15% of U.S. workers had already been working remotely and that 38% of those workers who formerly commuted were now working from home. Bick et al. (2021) reports that the proportion of newly remote workers rose from 8% in February to 35% in May, but Adams et al. (2020) notes substantial heterogeneity in the roll-out of remote work within industries and occupations. Meanwhile, in Japan, Okubo (2020) indicates that the percentage of remote workers in 2020 was 6% in January, 10% in March and 17% in June, but Morikawa (2020) finds the proportion in June to be higher, at 32%, based on a June 2020 survey.====This paper contributes to the literature by examining the relationship between job characteristics and the potential for remote work by exploiting the unique features of a Japanese worker panel data set which directly surveys whether a worker worked remotely. In addition, it records two measurable variables that are important determinants of the potential for remote work: the direct measurement of job task characteristics and the specific HRM characteristics of each employee’s work environment. The survey was implemented just before the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, and this makes this data set ideal for examining the natural determinants of the possibility for remote work. Further, identifying these natural determinants is useful for foreseeing the problems that might arise when employers are forced to adopt a remote work arrangement.====The high explanatory power of job characteristics variables has two important implications. First, on redistribution policy, the literature demonstrates that the negative impact of COVID-19 is heterogeneous across occupations and skill levels (Adams, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020, Mongey, Pilossoph, Weinberg, 2020, Brussevich, Dabla-Norris, Khalid, 2020, Kikuchi, Kitao, Mikoshiba, 2021) and the likelihood of working remotely is strongly associated with a negative income shock (Mongey et al., 2020). Thus, our finding of a heterogeneous probability of engaging in remote work according to job tasks within a standard industry/occupation category implies that a heterogeneous negative income shock will exist even within the category. This therefore calls for a careful examination of the current income change and a much more fine-grained transfer policy to compensate for any earnings loss due to COVID-19.====Second, this study has important implications for the human resource management policies of private companies in terms of maintaining productivity. There is a strong relationship between HRM practices based on individual performance measures (such as pay for performance, management by key performance indicator, or management by objectives) and the potential for remote work, implying that remote work can occur only when output is observable and measurable (Allen, Golden, Shockley, 2015, Bloom, Liang, Roberts, Ying, 2015, Sewell, Taskin, 2015, Groen, van Triest, Coers, Wtenweerde, 2018).==== However, the output of certain jobs is inherently difficult to observe or quantify, and this potential for “shirking from home” is the major reason why some workers are not permitted to work remotely. Despite this concern, however, the sudden implementation of social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic has forced firms to encourage remote work even for those workers in jobs deemed unsuitable for it. Thus, unless firms take measures to improve their observation of worker effort or output, the remote work phenomenon is likely to lead to reduced productivity in certain jobs, mainly because worker effort is difficult to sustain in the remote work environment.",Who can work from home?

Using data on nonfinancial listed firms in Japan, we show that only 0.8% of some 42,000 firm-year observations have female CEOs. There is also little evidence that firms appoint more females as CEOs during our sample period. While the stock market reacts positively to the introduction of a firm's first female CEO, the relationship between CEO gender and firm accounting performance is generally not strong. However, when we classify the type of female CEO, the estimated coefficient for a founder female CEO and ==== is positive and significant.","Women are known to account for a very small share of top positions in Japan, an issue that has attracted particular attention in recent years with “Womenomics” being part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's long-standing campaign to empower and engage more women in leadership. In 2014, Prime Minister Abe made a speech at the World Economic Forum, stating that “Japan must become a place where women shine. By 2020 we will make 30% of leading positions to be occupied by women”====.====The absence of women in top positions in Japan is particularly serious in business. At the same time, we know surprisingly little about top female executives in large companies in Japan. Who are they? Are there any differences in the performance of firms managed by female CEOs and those managed by their male counterparts? In addressing this research gap, this paper provides useful insights into female CEOs in Japan and empirical evidence concerning their impact on firm performance. To conduct this research, we constructed a large database of female CEOs in all listed nonfinancial firms in Japan from 2004 to 2015. The novelty of our research lies in this data set, where we painstakingly collected detailed information on every female CEO by hand.====Using our database, we confirm that the number of female CEOs in Japan is indeed very small. Of our some 42,000 firm-year observations, we find only 0.8% reflect a female CEO, with just 74 individual female CEOs leading some 77 listed firms during this period. This figure is substantially smaller than the 5% of female CEOs in China (Liu et al., 2014), 4.8% in Fortune 500 firms, 3% in the largest 145 Scandinavian companies, and the average of 9.4% across a sample of 18 European countries documented by Faccio et al. (2016).====In terms of findings, we examine the determinants of a firm having a female CEO and find that firms run by female CEOs are often younger, have smaller boards, more female directors, less leverage, and higher CEO and foreign ownership ratios. There is little suggestion that the proportion of female CEOs was increasing in Japan during our sample period and therefore little evidence that the “Womenomics” policy has been successful in encouraging firms to adopt female CEOs.====While several studies concern the relation between CEO gender and firm performance (Brinkhuis and Scholtens, 2018; Faccio et al., 2016; Hanousek et al., 2019; Khan and Vieito, 2013; Kirsch, 2018; Kolev, 2012; Lam et al., 2013), the results are generally mixed. One reason may be that these studies do not typically distinguish between female CEOs belonging to the founding family and other female CEOs. In support of this argument, previous studies show that a significant proportion of listed firms around the world are controlled by founding families (Anderson and Reeb, 2003; Faccio and Lang, 2002). Further, there is a difference in performance between firms controlled by professional managers and founding families (Anderson and Reeb, 2003; Faccio and Lang, 2002; Mehrotra et al., 2013; Saito, 2008; Villalonga and Amit, 2006). Therefore, it is important to distinguish between firms run by founding families and those managed by professional managers====.====One of the most important contributions of this paper is that we classify female CEOs into three types based on their appointment background: female CEOs who are a founder, an heir that inherited the firm from a family member, and other. A founder CEO is one of the original founders of the firm or was a main executive when the company was founded. An heir CEO is the heir of the firm founder. We refer to all other female CEOs as ‘==== CEOs’, being merely a promoted employee or recruited executive with no direct tie to company ownership====.====We investigate the relation between female CEOs and firm performance using a variety of methods, including ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed effects regressions, instrumental variable (IV) two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation, propensity score matching (PSM), difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation, and event studies. We find that the announcement of a female CEO appointment, when firms first switch from a male to a female CEO, is associated with positive and statistically significant abnormal returns. However, in general, the relationship between CEO gender and firm accounting performance is not strong. Nevertheless, when we classify the type of female CEO, the coefficient for founder female CEO and Tobin's Q is positive and significant in the fixed effects regression. While the estimated coefficients for heir and ==== CEOs vary and are not significant.====There are a number of advantages in using Japanese data to conduct this research, as the environment and culture of Japanese firms differ from the corporate contexts previously examined in the existing literature. First, boardrooms in Japan are frequently composed of male inside directors that joined the firm as undergraduates and were subsequently promoted internally after dozens of years in service (Aoki et al., 2007). As top managers are accustomed to working in male-only environments, the impact of having a female as their boss may be greater in Japan than in Western countries.====Second, previous studies show that the relation between female representation and firm performance depends on the business environment. According to Post and Byron's meta-analysis of the effect of female representation on the board of directors (Post and Byron, 2015), there is a positive relation between female board representation and firm performance in countries with stronger shareholder protection. In addition, they show that the relationship between female representation and performance depends on societal gender parity. Considering the substantial differences in corporate governance between Japan and Western countries====, it is important to examine the effects of female representation on large companies in the former.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and provide hypotheses regarding the relation between female CEOs and firm performance. Section 3 explains the research data and methodology.

We find evidence that exporting and multinational activities are associated with reduced GWGs. Domestic-owned firms that neither export nor invest abroad (i.e., domestic-only firms) report the largest GWG, followed by Japanese-owned ==== (JMNE), then by locally-owned exporters that do not invest abroad and finally by foreign-owned multinational enterprises (FMNE). We separate FMNE by mode of entry and confirm that FMNE established by greenfield investment deviate more than FMNE established by merger and acquisition from domestic-only firms in terms of wages. Greenfield-born FMNE are associated with the smallest GWG and largest gender-neutral wage premium among the firm types. The estimated GWG among Greenfield-born FMNE is almost 12 percentage-points lower than the 26.8 percent prevailing at domestic-only firms.","“Womenomics”, a concept first articulated by Kathy Matsui, vice chair of Goldman Sachs Japan, and adopted by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, proposes increasing female employment and reducing gender pay disparities in order to achieve economic growth.==== While Japan has improved its female labor force participation rates and now reports a rate that exceeds the OECD average by over 5 percentage points,==== it has not been as successful in reducing gender-based earnings inequality. Japan's raw gender earnings gap of 24.5 percent was much higher than the OECD average of 13.2 percent in 2017.==== Only South Korea (34.6 percent) and Estonia (28.3 percent) reported higher gender earnings gaps than Japan.====International activities, both trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), have the potential for impacting a country's gender earnings gap. We seek to explore how Japan's gender pay gap may be affected by exporting and multinational activities. Exposure to foreign markets and foreign gender norms through exporting and FDI outflows and inflows has the potential to impact male and female workers differently. Using linked employer-employee data for the manufacturing sector, we find suggestive evidence that international activities contribute to reducing Japan's gender wage gap (GWG). We find that foreign-owned multinational enterprises (FMNE) report the smallest GWG, followed by locally-owned firms that export but do not invest abroad, then by Japanese-owned MNE (JMNE) and finally by domestic-only firms (i.e., domestic-owned firms that neither export nor invest abroad).====After finding that FMNE deviate the most from domestic-only firms in terms of GWGs, we ask whether FMNE mode of entry matters for gender wage outcomes. We propose that FMNE originating from greenfield investment will deviate further from domestic-only firms than FMNE originating from mergers and acquisitions (M&A). A Greenfield-born FMNE involves foreigners in setting up the human resource management (HRM) and pay systems from the firm's establishment, while an M&A-born FMNE involves foreigners influencing and possibly changing existing HRM and pay systems.==== We find support for our hypothesis that Greenfield-born FMNE deviate the most from the gender wage inequality existing at domestic-only firms. Among majority-owned FMNE, only Greenfield-born ones are associated with significant, large reductions in the GWG while M&A-born FMNE do not differ significantly from domestic-only firms. Greenfield-born FMNE are associated with an 11.9 percentage-point smaller GWG than domestic-only firms that report a 26.8 percent GWG on average. Quintile regressions indicate that Greenfield-born FMNE deviate the most from domestic-only firms in terms of GWGs in the middle quintiles of the wage distribution.====Our research relates to three strands of literature. The first is extensive research on wage premiums paid by exporters or by foreign-owned firms. Early research on this topic used firm-level or plant-level data to estimate these wage premia while more recent empirical work has utilized matched employer-employee data in order to control for both firm characteristics and worker characteristics in estimating wage premia.==== While the research using matched datasets, especially panel matched datasets, has improved our understanding of these globalization wage premia by accounting for firm and worker heterogeneity, differing conclusions have been found. Using quasi-experimental variation in exports due to a currency devaluation, Frías et al. (2018) find a large causal link between exporting and wage premia using Mexican data (i.e., a 1 percent increase in a plant's export share leads to a 3 percent increase in the plant-specific wage premium). Heyman et al. (2007) reject the notion of wage premia paid by foreign-owned firms relative to domestic-owned firms using linked employer-employee data for Sweden, while Hijzen et al. (2013) find foreign-ownership wage premia of 1 to 6 percent using matched data for three developed economies (i.e., Germany, Portugal, the UK) and one developing economy (i.e., Brazil).====A second strand of related literature has focused on the impacts of international activities on gender pay disparities. While several papers have examined the potential links between import competition and GWGs,==== we focus on how exports and multinational activities may impact the GWG. On this topic, the literature is quite recent and relatively sparse but a few hypotheses have been proposed and empirically tested. Bøler et al. (2018) propose that exporting requires more flexible workers who can communicate with trade partners at odd hours and/or travel internationally on short notice, which tends to disfavor female workers who are perceived as being more family-oriented and therefore less flexible. Using matched employer-employee data, they find that entry into exporting by Norwegian firms leads to a three-percentage-point increase in the GWG among college-educated workers. Juhn et al. (2014) use firm-level data for Mexico to show that trade-liberalization-induced exporting increased the relative wage and employment of blue-collar women because exporting firms adopted new technologies that reduced the need for physically demanding skills. Blue-collar men were replaced by blue-collar women and new production technologies. These two papers suggest that the relationship between exporting and GWGs may differ substantially based on the skill or education level of workers.====Researchers also have explored the link between MNE and gender wage gaps. Oostendorp (2009) finds that the within-occupation GWG tends to decrease with trade and FDI in richer countries but no significant effects are found in poorer countries. Vahter and Masso (2019) use Estonian matched employer-employee data to conclude that foreign-owned firms have larger GWGs than locally-owned firms. They argue that the larger GWG is due to men capturing a larger share of MNE wage premiums. One previous study has used matched employer-employee data for Japan to study this issue. Ono and Odaki (2011) use matched data for 1998 to document MNE wage premiums and smaller GWGs within foreign-owned MNE. They suggest that FMNE may have an advantage in hiring career-minded Japanese women, who are under-valued by Japanese firms due to the seniority-wage and lifetime employment systems.==== They find a GWG of 28 percent in locally-owned firms, but only 19 percent in FMNE defined using a 10 percent foreign equity minimum to define FMNE.==== Our study updates and extends the work of Ono and Odaki (2011) by using more recent data (i.e., for 2012), by controlling for average worker productivity at the plant-level, by examining wage premiums over the wage distribution by using quintile regression methods, and by separating firms in our dataset into five different types, instead of only two types (i.e., foreign and domestic), which allows us to address the impacts of exporting, multinationality and foreign ownership. We also examine FMNE heterogeneity by home country, which has not been done previously with linked employer-employee data for Japan.====A third strand of related literature examines the transmission of culture across international borders through economic activity. Of particular interest is the transmission of more gender-neutral corporate culture into a country with less gender-neutral norms. Tang and Zhang (2017) find that foreign affiliates in China from more gender-equal countries tend to have higher female shares of employment compared with foreign affiliates from less gender-equal countries. Siegel et al. (2019) find that FMNE are more likely to hire and/or promote female managers in Korea, while Choi and Greaney (2020) find that FMNE acquisitions of Korean firms result in workforce reorganization that favors proportionately more women in the most elite postings within a firm. They also show that this workforce reorganization produces productivity gains for the acquired firms. ==== Kodama et al. (2018) find that FMNE tend to employ proportionately more women and more female managers than locally-owned firms in Japan. They also find that the FMNE tend to have more family-friendly workplace policies, such as flextime, telecommuting, used vacation days and childcare subsidies. Our results complement the Kodama et al. (2018) results in that we find wage-based evidence that foreign-owned MNE have more gender-equal pay structures than locally-owned firms in Japan. In addition, we find that Greenfield-born FMNE from more gender-equal home countries have lower firm-level GWGs in Japan.====We contribute to the literature in five distinctive ways. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to use linked employer-employee data for Japan to examine gender-based differences in employee returns to both exporting and MNE activities and to examine these wage differences while controlling for average worker productivity at the plant-level.==== These two international activities typically have been examined by separate strands of literature that seek to identify wage premiums, whereas we are able to directly compare and disentangle the two effects on wages and GWGs.==== By controlling for average worker productivity, we identify exporter and MNE wage premiums above the usual premiums arising from the tendency of these firms to be more productive than firms that do not export or invest abroad.====Second, our study presents a detailed analysis of international influences on gender wage gaps in Japan at a potentially important inflection point in time. By using wage data for 2012, we examine the labor market after major revisions were made in Japan's Equal Employment Opportunity Act (EEOA) in 1999 and 2007.==== Ono and Odaki (2011) used data for 1998, just before the EEOA changes occurred. Additionally, our 2012 data captures the labor market conditions in Japan just prior to the start of Abenomics policies related to women in the workforce and inward FDI. The Abenomics growth promotion policies include encouraging better utilization of Japan's female labor force and enticing more FDI inflows from 2013.==== Therefore, our study using 2012 data makes an important “post-EEOA revisions but pre-Abenomics” contribution to the literature.====Third, we distinguish between domestic-owned MNE and foreign-owned MNE and find substantial differences in worker wages, especially for women in Japan. We find that FMNE pay much larger gender-neutral wage premiums than JMNE operating in Japan, and female workers receive larger added wage premiums by working at FMNE so these firms feature the smallest GWGs. This implies that the “multinationality” of a firm matters in a quantitatively small way among Japanese-owned firms, but foreign ownership matters in a quantitatively large way in Japan's labor market.====Our fourth and perhaps most unique contribution is to separate FMNE based on their mode of entry which has not to our knowledge been previously done in the literature on FMNE wage premiums. This distinction allows us to test the hypothesis that mode of entry matters for the transmission of corporate gender norms. We propose that Greenfield-born FMNE are the most likely to deviate from the existing corporate gender norms in Japan,==== while other international firm types (i.e., M&A-born FMNE, JMNE and exporters) may be influenced by foreign gender norms to a lesser degree, using domestic-only firms as the reference group. Since our dataset does not distinguish between Greenfield-born FMNE and M&A-born FMNE, we make a unique contribution to the data by examining the history of each FMNE to determine whether its origin involved a foreign partner from the start. The advantage of separating FMNE based on mode of entry is it allows us to address the endogeneity problem for a specific group of foreign-owned firms using cross-sectional data. Smaller GWGs associated with FMNE may be due to foreign owners instituting a more gender-neutral pay system or due to foreign owners preferring to acquire local firms with more gender-neutral pay systems already in place. In order to conclude that foreign ownership drives gender wage outcomes, rather than vice versa, we separately identify FMNE established through greenfield investment. For these firms, foreign influence occurs from firm establishment so we can reasonably interpret the direction of causality as flowing from foreign ownership to gender wage outcomes.====Finally, our fifth contribution is to additionally allow for FMNE heterogeneity by home country and to link FMNE gender wage gaps in Japan to home country workplace gender equality. Using majority-owned FMNE, we find that Greenfield-born FMNE from more gender-equal home countries tend to have smaller gender wage gaps in their Japanese affiliates, but this tendency is not observed in M&A-born FMNE. This is a new result for the literature on the transmission of workplace gender norms across international borders.====Japan is an ideal country to use for this study for several reasons. First, Japan has some unique labor market characteristics such as the lifetime employment system and seniority wage system that have been identified as posing barriers to women in the labor market.==== Second, Japan has a large GWG but a relatively low level of male wage inequality, making it an interesting outlier among the 22 developed countries studied in Blau and Kahn (2003).==== Third, most of the FMNE in Japan are from countries that are more gender-equal than Japan in terms of employment practices. In the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2012, Japan was ranked 102 out of 135 countries for Economic Participation and Opportunity.==== In 2012, the largest foreign investors in Japan based on FDI stock ranked well above Japan in terms of gender equality using the same gender gap index, with the US (ranked 8) followed by the Netherlands (24), France (62) and the UK (33).====We present our methodology in the next section, followed by a description of our data sources and summary statistics. Section 4 presents our empirical results, followed by a section on robustness checks. We conduct robustness checks by changing our definition of foreign ownership from majority-foreign-ownership to a more expansive definition that includes all firms with 10 percent or more foreign capital ownership. In section 6, we discuss causal mechanisms linking gender wage gaps to our different firm types and include our results based on FMNE home country gender equality.

The important contributions of this study are its comparison of the relative contribution of training to productivity and wages and its distinction between manufacturing and service firms. The results indicate that training significantly contributes to the labor productivity, particularly for firms in the service sector. The elasticities of productivity and wages to training stock are similar in size, meaning that the returns to firms’ training investments are shared by their workers in proportion to the wage share of the value-added.","Upgrading human capital is an important economic policy to improve productivity and wages. An improvement in the quality of the workforce has contributed to the economic growth rate by 0.3% points per annum during the past two decades in Japan.==== In addition to school education, employer-provided training — On-the-job training (OJT) and Off-the-job-training (Off-JT) — is an important form of human capital investment. Intangible capital, the role of which is stressed in recent productivity studies, includes firm-specific human capital as a subset of “economic competencies” (e.g., Corrado ====., 2009; Fukao ====., 2009). In the empirical studies of intangible investments, firm-specific human capital is estimated as the cumulative sum of employer-provided training expenditures.====Employer-provided training has stagnated in Japan, however, since the Global Financial Crisis. According to the Basic Survey of Human Resources Development conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, training expenditures declined in Japanese firms until 2013 and only weakly recovered afterwards (====).==== Against this background, the “Human Resources Development Revolution” became a pillar of the Japanese government's recent economic growth strategy. In addition to pecuniary support for education, including the expansion of free preschool and higher education for children in low-income households, in 2018 the government introduced corporate tax deductions for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that increased training expenditures as well as subsidies for employer-provided training irrespective of firm size using the Special Account for Employment Insurance.====The implicit assumption behind these policies to support firms’ investments in human resources development is that actual investments are lower than socially desirable level. Theoretically, whether firms are truly underinvesting in training depends on various factors: the quantitative contribution of employer-provided training to productivity; whether the skill acquired through the training is general or firm-specific; the division of returns to training investments between firms and workers; and the degree of market imperfection in capital and labor markets (see Leuven, 2005 for a survey of the literature). In order to plan appropriate policy measures, empirical studies on training's productivity impact and on the allocation of returns are indispensable.====This study contributes to the literature and to the related policy planning by illustrating the quantitative relationship between human capital stock from firm-provided training and the productivity and wages of Japanese firms covering both large listed firms and SMEs. It draws upon a large panel data set from the Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities (BSJBSA), conducted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry for the years 2009–2018. It should be mentioned that the human resource investments in the BSJBSA are limited to Off-JT. Traditionally, with lifelong employment practices and the seniority wage system, informal OJT has been viewed as the main way to improve productivity in Japanese firms. With the changing structure of the Japanese labor market, though, the role of Off-JT has increasingly attracted attention from firm managers. In addition, as the Japanese Government has recently expanded tax and subsidization measures to promote formal employee training programs, a study on the impact of Off-JT has the potential to inform the policy planning.====The results of this study can be summarized as follows. First, firm-provided training significantly contributes to the labor productivity of the firm, and the rate of return on training investments is higher than that on investments in tangible capital. Second, the elasticity of productivity with respect to training stock is greater for service firms than for manufacturing firms. Third, the elasticities of productivity and wages with respect to training stock are similar in size, meaning that the returns to employer-provided training are shared by their employees in proportion to the labor share of the value-added.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

I use empirical evidence on these two types of lockdowns to extend an epidemiological and economic model: the SIR-Macro model. I calibrate this extended model to Japanese data and conduct some numerical experiments. The results show that the interaction of these two types of lockdowns plays an important role in the low proportion of infectious individuals and the large decrease in consumption in Japan.","The second type of lockdown that I focus on is the request-based lockdown that the Japanese government adopted. Although the Japanese government declared a state of emergency from April to May in 2020, it did not legally enforce or administer penalties on noncompliance with its request to stay at home.==== Thus, the government let people choose whether to go out or not. Such a request-based lockdown can have heterogeneous effects on individuals’ choice of whether to stay at home.====Voluntary and request-based lockdowns potentially affect infections and the economy during the pandemic. Moreover, they are not unique to Japan but observed in other countries.==== Nonetheless, their quantitative effects have been largely unexplored by the literature as I review in ====. To void this gap, I try to answer the following questions. First, do people really respond to the risk of infection in deciding whether to stay at home or not; and if so, to what extent? Second, to what extent do voluntary and request-based lockdowns, solely or interactively, constrain infections and economic activities?==== to incorporate voluntary and request- based lockdowns. In the model, susceptible individuals balance the utility from going out to consume goods that involve with the risk of infection and the disutility from the infection. Their optimization generates a feedback from the risk of infection to the voluntary lockdown, and then to the transmission rate of the virus, which, in turn, reduces the risk of infection. Moreover, the request-based lockdown decreases the utility from going out. I calibrate the model based on Japanese data and conduct some numerical experiments to examine the effects of both types of lockdowns.====My results can be summarized as follows: First, voluntary lockdowns existed in all three waves in Japan, although their degrees have declined over the three waves. Second, the interaction of these two types of lockdowns play an important role in the low proportion of infectious individuals and the large decrease in consumption in Japan.====There is a rapidly growing literature on the impacts of Covid-19 on the macroeconomy as I briefly review in ====. Some of them focus on the substitution from high- to low-risk consumption goods as this present study does (====; ====; ====). However, as far as I know, none of these studies focuses on the extensive margin of whether going out to purchase goods that involve the risk of infection or not. Incorporating this extensive margin has two benefits: First, I can use the actual high-frequency (i.e., daily) data about the proportion of individuals who go out to set the model's parameters. Moreover, it turns out that a voluntary lockdown can have a large negative effect on the proportion of infectious individuals with plausible parameters including the disutility from the infection and thus helps to account for their level observed in Japan.====I further contribute to the literature by incorporating a request-based lockdown and examining its epidemiological and economic effects. Request-based lockdowns are different from uniform lockdowns (examined by ====, among others) in that some people do not stay at home under the former. Request-based lockdowns are also different from targeted lockdowns (e.g., ====, among others) in that the government does not intentionally decide who stays at home under the former while the government intentionally does under the latter. Consequently, request-based lockdowns can have unique epidemiological and economic effects.====The rest of this study proceeds as follows: In ====, I briefly review the related literature. In ====, I present reduced-form evidence on the presence of a voluntary lockdown from prefecture-level daily data and its effects on the infection and consumption. In ====, I present the SIR-Macro model that incorporates voluntary and request-based lockdowns. In ====, I set the parameters. ==== presents numerical experiments to show the effects of voluntary and request-based lockdowns. ==== concludes.====In this Appendix, I solve for the maximization of individuals in each health status.====A recovered individual's problem can be written in the recursive form as:====under budget constraint (7).

We first find the business suspension request decreased targeted firms’ sales by 10 percentage points on top of the baseline 9 percentage points decline due to COVID-19, even though the Japanese anti-contagion policy was in a form of the government’s request that is not legally enforceable. Second, using a discontinuity in the eligibility criteria, we find lump-sum and prompt subsidies improved firms’ prospects of survival by 19 percentage points. Third, the medium-run recovery of firms’ performance is expected to depend crucially on when infections would end, indicating that the anti-contagion policies could complement longer-run economic goals.","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which started in early 2020, had already resulted in more than 100 million confirmed cases and two million deaths worldwide by the end of 2020. Large-scale social anti-contagion policies, such as the lockdown of cities, temporary closure of businesses, and prohibition of group gatherings, have been employed throughout the world to contain the spread of infection (====, ====), through the reduction of people’s movements and contact (====). These anti-contagion policies inevitably have been accompanied by a deep recession in the world economy (====) polarized society into two: those who wish to control the spread of the virus and those who emphasize the economic down-side (====). In the longer run, however, anti-contagion policies could benefit both health and the economy (====). At the same time, governments have introduced several economic policies to soften the economic damage of anti-contagion policies, such as massive injections of money into lending markets and the provision of direct subsidies to households and firms. To make the correct decisions under crisis, governments need to understand the short-run economic and epidemiological trade-off as well as the potential long-run benefits of anti-contagion and economic policies.====In this study, we perform a causal inference on the short-run effects of anti-contagion policies on the economy, the impacts of subsidies to firms to ease the economic damage, as well as the potential medium-run economic benefits of the anti-contagion policies. This study focuses on small businesses, which are most vulnerable to the economic crisis. We study this issue in the context of Japan, where the number of new infections surged from March to April 2020, followed by the declaration of emergency state, which led to the local governments’ request for firms to suspend business temporarily and for individuals to stay at home. At the same time, the Japanese government introduced a series of new subsidy schemes to rescue small businesses. The Japanese case is unique in that the attempt to contain infections is closely tied to a longer-term economic goal, namely, the possibility of hosting the Tokyo Olympic Games. Thus, Japan’s short-run stringent anti-contagion policies could lead to a longer-run economic goal, thereby providing an ideal case for evaluating the short-run tension between epidemiological and economic goals as well as the longer-run complementarity between these two goals.====First, we investigate how the emergency declaration and the business suspension request hurt the performance of small businesses.

Identification of monetary policy shocks under the effective lower bound (ELB) has been a central issue among macroeconomic researchers as well as central bankers. The existing literature on unconventional monetary policies mainly examines the magnitude of monetary policies on financial markets. As Kuttner (2018) and Dell’Ariccia et al. (2018) show, a preponderance of evidence suggests that forward guidance and quantitative easing have succeeded in lowering long-term interest rates. D’Amico et al. (2012), Gagnon et al. (2011), and Hamilton and Wu (2012) estimate the effects of quantitative easing (QE) by the Federal Reserve on lower 10-year term premiums. Swanson (2017) uses the data on intra-daily frequencies to separately identify the forward guidance and asset purchase program components, which are conducted by the Federal Reserve. Arai (2017), Eser and Schwaab (2016), Ghysels et al. (2016), and Krishnamurthy et al. (2018) examine the effects of unconventional monetary policies by the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank on government bond yields. Inoue and Rossi (2019) examine the exchange rates of the U.K., Europe, Canada, and Japan and show that tightening monetary policy in a conventional period generally leads to the appreciation of a country’s nominal spot exchange rate. There is a consensus among researchers as to the accommodative effects of unconventional monetary policies on financial markets.====However, the existing studies provide scant evidence on the macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policies due to difficulty in identifying monetary policy shocks. The few exceptions are Nakamura and Steinsson (2018), Hanisch (2017), Kimura and Nakajima (2016), and Koeda (2019). Nakamura and Steinsson (2018) examine the effect of QE by the Federal Reserve. Although they investigate the macroeconomic effects of QE, their approach is based on financial market measures. Hanisch (2017), Kimura and Nakajima (2016), and Koeda (2019) investigate the impacts of unconventional monetary policy by the Bank of Japan. They show that unconventional monetary policy shocks have a significant effect on the output gap, whereas they report mixed evidence as to whether expansionary unconventional monetary policy shocks increase inflation rates.====Based on the new and simple approach proposed by Bu et al. (2021), we identify a unified measure of conventional and unconventional monetary policy shocks from daily changes in the term structure of interest rates. While identification strategies in the literature, such as Hanisch (2017), Kimura and Nakajima (2016), and Koeda (2019), depend on the outstanding balance of current accounts held at the Bank of Japan and (or) monetary aggregates, our strategy to identify shocks utilizes information on the term structure of interest rates. Thus, it focuses on the interest rate channel. The reason why we use information on the yield curve instead of monetary aggregates is because the chief transmission mechanism of monetary policy is the interest rate channel, even under the ELB. For example, forward guidance aims to lower longer-term interest rates by promising to keep the future path of shorter-term interest rates at virtually zero for a considerable period of time. Government bond purchase program can push the bond prices higher and lower the longer-term interest rates. The provision of liquidity, via current accounts held by the Bank of Japan, aims to facilitate the flow of funds to firms that face a severe business environment or difficulty in obtaining funding. Because it increases in the excess reserve in a timely manner, the Bank of Japan seeks to avoid the excess volatility in key policy rates to ensure the interest rate channel is functioning well.==== Inflation goals are another approach to influencing the interest rates. In December 2009, the Bank of Japan clarified medium- to long-term price stability, which is in a positive range of two percent or lower. Such an announcement can lower (real) interest rates by increasing inflation expectations via the Fisher equation. Because the policies conducted by the Bank of Japan under the ELB as well as during the “conventional” period aim to lower interest rates and to ensure the interest rate channel functions well, our identification strategy for measuring monetary policy shocks utilizes information on the term structure of interest rates.====Using monetary policy shocks, identified from information on the term structure of interest rates, we examine the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy in Japan from 1999 to 2011. We show the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy; a contractionary monetary policy shock significantly decreases not only output but also inflation rates even under the ELB. The dynamics of output and inflation rates in response to a monetary policy shock conforms to macroeconomic theory. However, the magnitude of the shocks is small because the policy rates are virtually zero. Thus, the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy shocks are statistically significant, but they are modest.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 shows the strategy for identifying monetary policy shocks. Section 3 explains the structural VAR model we use and shows impulse responses to a monetary policy shock.

As the new capital is operated and productivity improves, the shape of the movements in the standard productivity growth resembles a J-curve. However, when costs associated with investment for new technology are recognized as intangible investment - which is not counted in the conventional value added –, the revised TFP growth including these unmeasured intangibles show different movements from the standard TFP growth. Following Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson (2021), we examine the gap between the standard TFP growth and the revised TFP growth. According to their theory, unmeasured intangibles are estimated by the gap between the shadow value and the price of investment goods. We obtain this shadow value of investment through an estimated parameter in each asset using listed firm-level data and revise the standard TFP growth rate. In the case of all ====, the standard TFP growth is overestimated in most years in the late 1990s and the 2000s, because the growth in intangible investment associated with measured investment is lower than measured capital accumulation rate. When we focus on the IT-intensive industries, we find the productivity J-curve in the late 1990s, at the early stage of the IT revolution, as indicated by Brynjolfsson, Rock and Syverson (2021).","When the IT revolution started in the late 1990s, many expected the increase in IT investment to lead to improvements in productivity. While in the US, labor productivity growth accelerated from 1.49% in the period from 1973 to 1995 to 2.30% from 1995 to 2006,==== productivity growth in Japan and the EU countries did not grow at a faster rate. As shown in Fig. 1, Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth in Japan was almost 0% in the late 1990s, although the share of IT capital formation (information and communication machineries and software) in all capital formation grew from 8.7% to 13% for the same period. Van Ark et al. (2008) also showed that the US GDP per man-hour accelerated from 1995 to 2006, while for the EU 15, GDP per man-hour slowed for the same period.====Most researchers have agreed that intangibles are the key factors explaining the disconnect between IT capital formation and productivity growth. For example, intangibles such as software and skilled workers are indispensable for productivity growth when we use IT facilities effectively. This complementary role of intangibles is emphasized in the Economic Report of the President 2007 of the US government, where it was noted that “Only when they made intangible investments to complement their IT investments did productivity growth really take off.” Bloom, et al. (2011) showed that management practices in the US contributed more to the efficient use of IT within a firm than management practices in European firms. In this case, intangibles represented by management practices contribute to an improvement in firm performance. According to this argument, the slower productivity growth in Japan and major EU countries compared to the US can be explained by the lack of accumulation of intangibles.====Brynjolfsson et al. (2021) developed the above discussions to explain the secular stagnation of the US economy. They pointed out that slow productivity growth in the US is inconsistent with new technological advances such as in Artificial Intelligence and robots. They argued that official statistics do not account for the effects of intangibles such as the training of skilled laborers and organizational changes associated with the introduction of AI and robots. To conceptualize their arguments, they combine growth accounting with the standard investment theory with adjustments costs developed by Lucas (1967); Uzawa (1969), and Hayashi (1982). Investments with new technological innovation require large adjustment costs that should be accounted for as intangible investment in the System of National Accounts. This leads to productivity growth being underestimated when measured by the standard growth accounting when investments with new technological innovation are carried out aggressively. It is then overestimated after the capital with new technology is sufficiently accumulated. As a result, the movements in standard productivity growth resemble a J-curve. Based on their findings, they conclude that the slow productivity growth in the US after the Global Financial Crisis should be revised upward, because many innovative activities such as AI, robots and sharing services were carried out in the US in the 2010s and should have led to higher productivity.====Following Brynjolfsson et al. (2021), we also examine how unmeasured intangibles affect productivity growth in Japan. The adjustment costs of investment provide key parameters for the measurement of intangibles. Using estimated results of adjustment costs of investment, we measure the gap between the standard TFP growth and the revised TFP growth. Unfortunately, in the case of the whole economy, the standard TFP growth is overestimated in almost all years in the late 1990s when the IT revolution started. However, we find that the movements in the gap seem to follow a J-curve in the IT-intensive industries in the late 1990s. We also find the productivity J-curve in two other periods (from the mid to late 2000s and from the mid to late 2010s), although the scales of these curve are smaller than in the late 1990s.====Our paper consists of six sections. In the next section, we review the related literature. We focus on two research fields: the recent empirical studies on the multiple q theory of investment, and the recent issues in productivity measurement. In the third section, following Brynjolfsson et al. (2021), we introduce a revised growth accounting equation using a standard investment theory with adjustment costs. In this section, we show that the standard TFP growth is underestimated when large adjustment costs associated with new technological investment are accounted for as intangibles. In the fourth section, we explain our dataset to estimate adjustment costs using firm-level data. Then in the fifth section, we estimate the adjustment costs of multiple capital goods. Based on these estimation results, we measure our revised productivity growth in the sixth section. Although the productivity J- curve in the late 1990s is not found in the case of the whole economy, we find the productivity J-curve in the 1990s in the IT intensive industries. Then in the last section, we summarize our results and discuss remaining questions to be researched.",Does the productivity J-curve exist in Japan?-Empirical studies based on the multiple q theory,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158321000162,2 May 2021,2021,Research Article,54.0

We construct a life-cycle model explaining households’ consumption/saving and housing decisions under collateral and borrowing constraints. We estimate this model using data from the ==== (FIES), which includes data on households’ housing wealth estimated from objective information. Using the estimated model, we then conduct a counterfactual simulation in which we assume that housing prices remained constant during the bubble period. Doing so allows us to quantify the gains/losses of lifetime utility due to the housing price boom and bust. We find that 72.2% of the households experienced an average decrease in lifetime utility equivalent to 5.7% of lifetime income. On average, Japan's housing price boom and bust caused a loss in lifetime utility equivalent to 4.7% of lifetime income. Moreover, we compare the impact of the housing price bubble across cohorts and find that the impact was greatest for those who experienced the bubble at ages 35–45.","What is the most expensive good that households purchase? The answer, for most Japanese households, is a house. To buy a house, it is quite common for households to save money to make a down payment and borrow five to eight times their annual income. Moreover, the value of a house tends to affect how much the bank will lend. Therefore, fluctuations in housing prices over time can have a significant impact on households’ lifetime resources.====The fluctuations in housing prices during Japan's bubble were dramatic. Fig. 1 shows the average housing wealth held by Japanese households.==== As can be seen from the figure, housing wealth increased rapidly, especially in the Tokyo area, from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Households’ housing wealth almost doubled within five years and then gradually declined over ten years. This dramatic change in housing wealth primarily reflects changes in land prices, which are shown in Fig. 2. Since residential real estate prices in Japan primarily reflect the price of the land on which a house sits, the dramatic changes in housing wealth were largely driven by changes in land prices.====How did Japanese households react to such dramatic changes in housing prices? Fig. 3 presents homeownership rates by age across different cohorts. Homeownership increases by age, and a typical Japanese household buys a house when the head is aged between 35 and 45. The larger markers in Fig. 3 are for observations falling into Japan's bubble period (1988–1992). The figure suggests that homeownership rates did not change in response to the boom and bust of housing prices. That is, despite the dramatic increase in housing prices, there was no discernible change in the life stage (age of the household head) at which households typically buy a house. Therefore, instead of delaying buying a house, households may have reduced consumption or settled for a lower-quality house, receiving poorer housing services for a prolonged period. Since most Japanese households tend to prefer a new house and the average price of a house is five to eight times households’ income (see, e.g., Ito, 1991), Japan's housing price boom and bust may have had a significant impact on households’ lifetime utility.====The goal of this study is to quantify the impact of Japan's housing price boom and bust on Japanese households using household data. Specifically, we use data from the ==== (FIES) conducted by the Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The FIES data contain detailed information about households’ consumption, income, and financial assets. Moreover, the data provide information about household dwellings, such as the location, size, and type (apartment or house). We combined the FIES data with other datasets to estimate the objective value of households’ housing wealth. To concentrate on households that were most likely to be affected by the fluctuations in housing prices, we mainly focus on households with a head born from 1951–1955 and living in the Tokyo Metropolitan Employment Area (MEA).==== We construct a structural model that describes the consumption/saving and housing behavior of these households and estimate the model using the indirect inference method. Using the estimated model, we then conduct a counterfactual simulation in which housing prices are held constant from 1987–1999.====The simulation result indicates that 27.8% of the households experienced an average lifetime utility gain equivalent to 2.1% of lifetime income, while the 72.2% experienced an average lifetime utility loss equivalent to 5.7% of lifetime income. On average, Japan's housing price boom and bust caused a loss in lifetime utility equivalent to 4.7% of lifetime income. Moreover, we conduct a counterfactual “no bubble” simulation by using the households with a head born in the early 1940s (older cohort) and those with a head born in the early 1960s (younger cohort). Fig. 4 describes the cohorts we focus on. We find that the housing price bubble also had a negative impact on the lifetime utility of the households of older and younger cohorts, but the magnitude of the impact was smaller than that for households with a head born in the early 1950s.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the background to our study and provides an overview of the previous literature.

To do that, we explore monthly data on worldwide trade from January to August in 2019 and 2020. Specifically, our study data include the exports of 34 countries to 173 countries. We estimated the gravity equation by employing various variables as a proxy for the COVID-19 damage. Our findings can be summarized as follows: First, regardless of our measures to quantify the COVID-19 pandemic, we found significantly negative effects of COVID-19 on the international trade of both exporting and importing countries. Second, those effects, especially the effects of COVID-19 in importing countries, tended to become insignificant since July 2020. This result implies that the harmful impacts of COVID-19 on international trade were accommodated after the first wave of the pandemic to some extent. Third, we found heterogeneous effects across industries. The negative effects on non-essential, durable products persist for a long time, whereas positive effects in industries providing medical products were observed.","In the third quarter of 2020, countries have gradually been recovering from the coronavirus pandemic (hereafter, COVID-19) in terms of economic activities. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Subsequently, to slow the coronavirus spread, many countries have imposed some form of restrictions on people and businesses. Several countries have declared citywide or nationwide lockdowns. In addition, many countries have imposed an entry ban on foreigners. Strict restrictions were observed in the second quarter of 2020, in particular. This was the first wave of the pandemic. Afterwards, most countries started to lift such restrictions. As a result, economies also started to regain their growth—for example, GDP in the third quarter recorded positive growth in some countries, such as China.==== Although the second wave hit Western countries in the third quarter, learnings from the first shock enabled people's social and economic activities to be better maintained during the subsequent pandemic period.==== and countries where remote work/operation is less feasible. The effect of the COVID-19 damage in an importing country is mainly due to the decrease in aggregate demand in that country. The reductions in people's earnings and their visits to retail outlets led to a reduction in demand. We empirically investigated how these negative effects of COVID-19 changed over time.====We expected that the negative effects of COVID-19 on international trade would decrease after the first wave. Most people in the world, especially the current generation, have never experienced a comparable level of restrictions or lockdown orders. At the beginning of the first wave, we did not know how to “behave” in the pandemic world. Thus, many countries chose a simple measure, that is, forcing people to stay at home and closing factories and offices. We acquired some knowledge through this experience and gradually started putting infection control measures (e.g., social distancing) in place. Furthermore, online business talks and conventions became more commonplace. Online shopping also became one of the standard methods for purchasing goods. Therefore, as our experience with the pandemic increases, the adverse effects of COVID-19 are expected to decline over time.====More specifically, we regressed bilateral trade values on various measures of the severity of COVID-19 at a monthly level. We used four measures for the severity of COVID-19. The first and second are the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in importing and exporting countries, respectively. The third measure is people's mobility with regards to retail and recreation for importing countries and workplaces for exporting countries. Similarly, the fourth measure is the share of days in each month when stay-at-home orders were in effect in importing countries or when workplace-closing orders were in effect in exporting countries. To investigate the changes in the effects of COVID-19 over time, we interacted these COVID-19 measures with dummy variables indicating months. By estimating this model, we explored how the coefficients for the COVID-19 damage changed over the months. We also estimate our model by industries to uncover the heterogeneous effects across industries. Our study data include the exports of 34 countries to 173 countries.====Our findings can be summarized as follows: First, regardless of our measures for the severity of COVID-19, we found negative effects of COVID-19 on international trade in both exporting and importing countries. Second, those effects, especially the effects of COVID-19 in importing countries, tended to be insignificant since July. Third, COVID-19 led to a decrease in imports of mineral products, leather products, and transport equipment, especially in April and May. The negative effects on the imports of non-essential, durable products tend to persist. On the other hand, the impact on the machinery products, which include information technology (IT)-related products, has become insignificant since July. Furthermore, we found positive effects of COVID-19 in importing countries in some medical products, even during March-May. Fourth, labor-intensive industries such as textiles were likely to suffer from the negative impacts of COVID-19 in exporting countries. In particular, the negative effect in the footwear industry lasted until August. The transport equipment industry also experienced negative effects of COVID-19 in exporting countries, especially in April and May.====Our study contributes to the literature on the international trade-COVID-19 nexus. ==== examined the exports of medical products from China during the pandemic period.

Using panel data and employing fixed effects to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity, we find that these policies have had some success in increasing married women’s share of time spent in paid employment. However, the increase in the share of time spent in paid employment is not largely compensated by cutting down the share of time spent in home production. This necessitates the need to cut down the share of time spent for leisure, implying a “double burden” of work for women. Further, work-life balance policies in married men’s firms do not appear to significantly influence their time allocation between various activities on a typical working day. We find that although work-life balance policies do not appear to influence the desirability of having a child for all women, they help women with children younger than six years raise the share of time spent in paid employment by largely cutting down their time allocation to home production.","Japan is a highly industrialized country with one of the highest standards of living in the world. However, there exists significant gender gap in both labour market participation and time spent performing unpaid domestic chores and care work. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (2017) statistics, the gender gap in labour market participation in Japan is roughly 10 percent higher than that for Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. On the other hand, the time spent by men in home production such as childcare, caring for the elderly and all other routine household tasks is rather low in Japan relative to most advanced economies. The (OECD Gender Data Portal, 2016) reports the average number of minutes spent by men and women in different activities on a typical day (weekdays and weekends) that include paid jobs as well as unpaid work like routine housework and caring for household members. We found that men spend nearly eight times as much time in paid work than in domestic chores in Japan, while men in all OECD countries together spend around 2.3 times as much time in paid jobs as in home production. This indicates a larger share of time in a day that Japanese women need to spend on unpaid domestic chores and caring for children and the elderly relative to their counterparts in other OECD countries, leaving little time for paid employment. Unlike for men, working full-time posed to be a challenging and almost impossible task for women that could be performed alongside raising children. The working environment in Japan was characterized by lack of work-life balance such as long hours of work, large incidents of overtime work, limited availability of childcare facilities in workplaces, limited availability and uptake of family care leave. Cultural norms about gender roles in the household which emphasized women’s role in performing household tasks, childcare and providing care to the elderly; while emphasizing men to be the sole earners of income in a household as well as the aforementioned characteristics of workplaces have potentially contributed to the gender gap in labour market participation and engagement in domestic chores as well as care work in Japan.====One of the earliest legislations that aimed at prohibiting gender discrimination in the labour market in Japan was the Equal Employment Opportunity Law (EEOL), which was enacted in 1986. The EEOL prohibited gender discrimination during recruitment, promotion and retirement as well as worker dismissal on account of personal life events like marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and uptake of maternity leave entitlements. The EEOL, however, had no provisions that could help make workplaces women-friendly through generous provision of family care leave system, limiting long hours of work and overtime work. Importantly, the EEOL did not have any provision that could encourage men to participate in routine household tasks and childcare. Abe (2011) finds that the EEOL has not led to an increase in regular full-time employment for Japanese women. The period from the late 1990s is marked by the enactment of a number of legislations by the government of Japan with the aim of increasing women’s participation in paid employment, men’s involvement in childcare and raising Japan’s birth rate. These policies taken together are referred to as the work-life balance policies. Unlike in other industrialized countries, work-life balance policies in Japan were not promoted to achieve balance between labour and leisure time; but especially with the purpose of balancing time allocation between husbands and wives between paid employment and domestic chores including care work. These policies include obligation to establish family care leave system that include childcare and (elderly parental) care leave systems to help workers who are taking care of children as well as their elderly parents, limitations on late-night work and overtime work as well as measures to shorten working hours especially for workers who are responsible for taking care of children aged three or less, prohibition of discrimination against workers who take leave in order to promote workers to take up these paid leaves, expansion of family care leave system to part-time employees, extension of the childcare leave period as well as establishment of injured or sick child care leave system. Most of these policies were mandated to be implemented by large-sized firms, especially firms with more than 300 employees and smaller firms were required to take steps to implement these measures. Important policy measures taken by the government to increase men’s involvement in childcare include extending the childcare leave period to until the child is one year and two months old if both parents take leave, men being allowed to take childcare leave again even after they have taken eight weeks leave during childbirth as well as abolishing prohibition on men from taking childcare leave if they had non-working wives.====The Japanese work-life balance policies focused in the paper are essentially family-friendly policies for married men and women. These include an improvement in the availability and usability of (1) childcare leaves, (2) parental care leaves, (3) days off for childcare, (4) days off for frail parents, (5) exemptions from overtime working hours for individuals responsible for child and parental care, (6) exemptions from night work for individuals responsible for child and parental care, (7) provisions of short working hours on account of child and parental care responsibilities (if an employee requested), and (8) careful considerations of transfer to new offices for employees taking care of a child or a frail parent. The first four are the most important policies that were promoted. Paid childcare leaves can be taken either by the mother or the father for continuous days, one time for one child younger than one-year old. Paid parental care leaves can be taken for less than 94 days in total in a year for family members who need help daily at least for two weeks. Paid days off can be taken for less than 6 days mainly for a preschool child or a family member (and 11 days for more than or equal to two preschool children or family members). We focus on these four policies regarding the provision of childcare and parental care paid leaves and/or days off, referred to as work-life balance policies in this paper. This is because these were the policies that received most encouragement for implementation and our dataset asks the availability of paid leaves and/or days off in the workplace every year. We can, thus, follow policy changes in work places over time. Therefore, we study the impact of these work-life balance policies on time allocation of women and their husbands between paid employment, home production and other activities (that include leisure and personal care).==== We focus on the sample of currently working couples who are not engaged in self-employment. We use panel data from the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers (JPSC) for our analysis. The JPSC provides information on a rich set of demographic controls as well as other employment characteristics of couples. We find that throughout our period of analysis, job continuity for women increased and it is associated with the availability of work-life balance policies. However, an important aim of work-life balance policies, as was noted earlier, is not only to raise women’s time spent in paid employment, but also to encourage men to spend time in home production and caring for others. This is because increase in time spent in paid employment may not result in significantly reducing the time spent performing domestic tasks, leading to “double burden” of work for women, especially in societies with strict social norms about the gender division of labour within the household. Therefore, we primarily focus on how work-life balance policies affect the time allocation of currently working women between various activities on a typical working day. As a comparison, we also study whether work-life balance policies in men’s firms affect their time allocation.====To study the effect of work-life balance policies on time allocation for currently married and working women; we use the fixed effects estimation model that potentially account for unobserved individual heterogeneity, year fixed effects that control for overall macroeconomic trends and other demographic variables that could plausibly influence time allocation between paid employment, home production and other activities. We find that work-life balance policies in the woman’s firm increase the share of time women spend in paid employment on a typical working day by 1.3 percentage points. Interestingly, we find that the increase in the share of time spent in paid employment is compensated by a decline in the share of time spent in home production and other activities. In our baseline specification, the point estimates suggest an equal reduction in the share of time spent in home production and other activities to compensate for the increase in time spent in paid employment for currently married, working women. Restricting the sample further to include women who have been working for the same firm throughout the survey period, we continue to see that work-life balance policies have raised the share of time spent in paid employment for women. Although the share of time spent in home production and other activities are found to fall by equal magnitude from the point estimates, but they are no longer statistically significant. One possibility is that when we limit our estimation sample further to include women who are also working for the same firm throughout the survey period, we don’t have enough variation in our data to identify significant declines in the shares of time spent on home production and other activities in our fixed effects estimation method. Therefore, our baseline analysis shows that increase in time spent in paid employment is not completely offset by decline in time spent on home production on a typical working day for women. This necessitates a decline in the time spent on other activities such as leisure and personal care. Additionally, we also instrument for the presence of work-life balance policies in the woman’s firm with the past prevalence of work-life balance policies at the industry level to which the woman’s firm belongs.==== Our results from the instrumental variable estimation strategy also show that work-life balance policies raise the share of time spent in paid employment and this is largely compensated by a decrease in the share of time spent performing other activities; whereas home production is largely unaffected for currently married, working women. Further, work-life balance policies do not appear to influence women’s time allocation on a typical day off and these policies in men’s firms do not appear to significantly influence men’s time allocation to various activities on a typical working day. This paper also studies the effect of work-life balance policies on the willingness to have a (or another) child for working women, controlling for the number of children the woman already has. We are not able to find significant effect of work-life balance policies on the willingness to have a/another child in our baseline fixed effects estimation model.====We also study whether work-life balance policies differentially influence working women who have young children (children younger than 6) and those with no/older children (children older than 6) in the survey year. We find that for both categories of women, work-life balance policies raise the share of time spent in paid employment; however, the point estimate is slightly larger for women with younger children indicating that work-life balance policies especially help raise the share of time spent in paid employment for working women with young children. Interestingly, while work-life balance policies appear to lower the share of time spent in home production for working women with young children, they appear to lower the share of time spent on other activities for women with no/older children to accommodate for the rise in the share of time spent in paid employment. Further, our results do not appear to be driven only by women who work in the public sector.====The existing literature has largely studied the impact of leave policies on labour market outcomes of mothers in European countries, Canada and the United States. Many of these studies have studied the impact of parental leave policies on taking up of leaves by new parents, mothers’ post-birth return to the labour market as well as the effect of the duration of the leaves on fertility and job continuity of women (Ondrich, Spiess, Yang, Wagner, 2003, Lalive, Zweimuller, 2009, Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, Waldfogel, 2013, Schonberg, Ludsteck, 2014, Rossin-Slater, 2018). On the other hand, a growing literature has also focused on the effect of family leave policies on the uptake of leave by fathers, working hours of fathers, men’s involvement in childcare and housework in the aforementioned countries. While some studies indicate limited impact of childcare leave policies for fathers on their involvement with housework and childcare (Ekberg, Eriksson, Friebel, 2013, Kluve, Tamm, 2013); other studies have indicated that paternity leave entitlements are associated with greater involvement of men in childcare, sharing of domestic tasks among couples, likelihood that only the father takes leave so that the mother does not suffer from career interruption as well as both husband and wife taking leave among dual-earner couples and the ability of very young children to relate to their fathers (Nepomnyaschy, Waldfogel, 2007, Tanaka, Waldfogel, 2007, Almqvist, 2014, Bartel, Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, Stearns, Waldfogel, Bunning, Pollmann-Schult, 2016, Patnaik).====In the context of Japan, there exists a number of studies examining the different factors that potentially influence female labour force participation as well as its regional variation. For example, Abe (2018) studies the differences in female labour force participation across different regions of Japan. Kawaguchi (2019) examines the association between workplace and worker characteristics and the likelihood of facing maternity harassment by women and finds that regular employees are at higher risk of maternity harassment than their non-regular counterparts. Gunji and Miyazaki (2017) find that an important reason why labour supply of Japanese women is lower than men is because of wage differentials. Further, Teruyama et al. (2018) use firm-level panel dataset and find that the rise in part-time jobs on account of increase in female labour supply can explain the growth of non-regular workers in the Japanese labour market. However, in the context of the role of work-life balance policies in Japan, most of the studies have focused on the impact of these policies on outcomes of firms that implement these policies. In particular, the existing literature has found that work-life balance policies increase a firm’s sales and profit (Abe and Kurosawa, 2006) and raise the total factor productivity marginally for some firms in the long run (Yamamoto and Matsuura, 2011). Other studies have analysed the initial gender composition of the firm’s employees when firms implement maternity leave policies (Morita, 2005), proportion of female employees when firms provide work-life balance policy entitlements that are higher than those mandated by the law (Takeishi, 2006) as well as the effect of these policies on raising the proportion of women managers, turnover of female employees in Japanese firms (Hui-Yu, Takeuchi, Kato, Kodama, Yamaguchi, 2016). However to the best of our knowledge, whether work-life balance policies have been able to change the behaviour of husbands and wives in Japan in terms of their time allocation as well as women’s fertility preference after controlling for observed individual, family and firm characteristics of the couples as well as unobserved heterogeneity, has remained largely unexplored in the existing literature. In this regard, this paper is closer to the analysis of Foster and Stratton (2018) who use panel data to study whether labour market events (in their instance, promotions and terminations) influence the intra-household gender division of labour among married or cohabiting mixed-gender couples in Australia.====The main contribution of this paper has been to investigate the impact of work-life balance policies on time allocation between various activities of women and men. This is particularly important in the context of Japan as work-life balance policies were mostly implemented with a view to helping couples balance time between paid labour market activity and unpaid domestic chores, unlike in other industrialized economies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that has attempted to study the impact of work-life balance policies on time allocation among couples in Japan. As the government’s main focus was to bring about a change in time allocation among couples and thereby affect cultural norms about gender division of labour to some extent through these policies instead of how these policies can likely affect firms’ profitability, our paper contributes to the existing literature by analysing the extent to which these policies have been able to meet the aforementioned goals. Another significant contribution of the paper is using panel data for the purpose of our analysis. This paper uses the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers, a longitudinal dataset that contains rich source of information on the demographic, educational and labour market conditions of women and their husbands as well as detailed information on their children and parents between 1993 and 2013. Further, this survey records low attrition. Therefore, this dataset is unique in the context of Japan as it largely tracks the same couple over time. Further, using panel data for analysis also helps in controlling for potential unobserved heterogeneity, which could otherwise, influence our outcome variables and thereby make it difficult to infer whether changes in the outcome variables are plausibly on account of the change in policy. As far as we are aware of, this is the first paper that uses longitudinal data from Japan to study the impact of work-life balance policies on time allocation among couples as well as fertility preference of Japanese women.====This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the institutional background and our testing hypothesis; Section 3 describes the data used; Section 4 explains the empirical strategy used in this analysis; Section 5 presents the results and Section 6 concludes.",The Impact of Work-Life Balance Policies on the Time Allocation and Fertility Preference of Japanese Women,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158321000137,27 February 2021,2021,Research Article,57.0
Adams Renée B.,University of Oxford,"Received 7 July 2020, Revised 23 January 2021, Accepted 30 January 2021, Available online 20 February 2021, Version of Record 5 April 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjie.2021.101123,Cited by (1),"Moralistic trust arises when people believe others share their moral values. I examine whether trust in the finance industry has a moral foundation by comparing values and attitudes of finance professionals with those of the general population in two data sets: a unique data set on values of CFAs in 2016 paired with the World Value Survey, and the European Social Survey. I show that differences in “ethical” values of finance professionals and members of the population are generally smaller in countries where people trust financial institutions more. But as trust increases, these value differences become larger. I show that selection helps reconcile the differences in the cross-sectional and time-series results. In periods of high trust in the finance industry, e.g. the pre-crisis period, finance professionals in the sample are less educated. While many are asked what they think about finance professionals, my results suggest that asking finance professionals what ==== think can provide insights into how trust evolves with selection into the industry.","An important policy question in the wake of the global financial crisis is how to restore “the financial industry's most valuable asset” (Lagarde, 2015): trust. As the CFA Institute quote at beginning of the introduction illustrates, discussions on this topic often center on the importance of “values”, “ethics” and “culture” in finance.==== These discussions are consistent with theories of moralistic trust that argue that people are more likely to trust those with whom they share fundamental moral values (e.g. Fukuyama, 1995; Uslaner, 2002). While improving ethical norms and behavior is a worthy goal, there is little direct evidence that ethics are related to trust. To help address this gap in the trust literature, I provide the first large-scale empirical evidence on the extent to which finance professionals and members of the population share values and its interaction with trust.====“Trust in finance” is a form of “particularized” trust, which refers to specific trustees and expected behaviors (Uslaner, 2018). As with social or “generalized” trust, which describes a generalized situation-independent expectation about the behavior of others, potential determinants of particularized trust may be specific to the trustor, societal or both. But for particularized trust the characteristics of the trustee also play a role, even when trustees are not personally known to the trustor (Bauer and Freitag, 2018). By relating country-level measures of “trust in finance” to the characteristics of finance professionals and members of the population in that country, I try to shed light on whether specific trustee characteristics—in this case, measures of the relative ethicality of finance professionals—are correlated with trust in the industry.====My analysis focuses on regressions of measures of individuals’ ethical values on a finance professional dummy variable and the interaction between the finance professional dummy and country-level measures of trust in finance. The coefficient on the finance professional dummy captures the extent to which finance professionals and others do not share ethical values, i.e. there is a value gap. The coefficient on the interaction term captures the extent to which this gap is moderated by trust in finance.====As in much of the literature using survey-based measures of trust (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2002; Fungáčová, Hasan, Weill, 2019; Guiso, 2010, Stevenson and Wolfers, 2011), I do not claim to fully identify causal relationships. On the contrary, my results highlight the complexity of the relation between trustees’ characteristics and trust. The patterns I document thus add depth to the policy discussion and should inform future research.====It is difficult to measure individual ethics or morals, especially in a cross-country context. What is considered immoral in one country may not necessarily be immoral in another country. I draw on the literature that links morality to human values that are common across cultures to motivate an examination of trust in finance and the values of finance professionals in two large data sets of human values: a cross-sectional data set that combines values of Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA) with the World Value Survey (WVS) in 2016, and Round 8 of the integrated European Social Survey (ESS) with data between 2002 and 2016. I use the CFA sample because it has the most comprehensive data on values of finance professionals I am aware of. I use the ESS sample because it allows me to examine the evolution of trust in finance and values over time. Most importantly, using the ESS allows me to compare the period before and after the financial crisis.====Personal values are abstract desirable goals that serve as guiding principles in peoples’ lives (Kluckhohn, 1951; Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz, 1992). The dominant approach to studying human values draws on Schwartz's human value theory (Schwartz, 2017) which has been tested in more than 270 samples from more than 70 countries (Sverdlik, Roccas, and Sagiv, 2012) and extensively validated (Campbell, Jayawickreme, Hanson, 2015). According to Schwartz (1992) the range of motivationally distinct values that are recognized across cultures can be encompassed by the following ten values: self-direction (independent thought and action; choosing, creating, exploring), stimulation (excitement, novelty, and challenge in life), hedonism (pleasure and sensuous gratification for oneself), achievement (personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards), power (social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources), security (safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self), conformity (restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses likely to upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms), tradition (respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that traditional culture or religion provide the self), benevolence (preserving and enhancing the welfare of those with whom one is in frequent personal contact (the ‘in-group’)) and universalism (understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature).====To highlight conflicts and congruities between values, Schwartz typically represents them in a circular grouping of four sets of higher-order values. Values that lie close to each other have similar motivations, but distant values have antagonistic motivations. Starting at the top of the circle and going clockwise, the circular structure contains the “self-transcendence” values of universalism and benevolence, the “conservation” values of conformity, tradition and security, the “self-enhancement” values of power and achievement, hedonism, which Schwartz views as sharing elements of openness to change and self-enhancement, but closer to openness, and the “openness to change” values of stimulation and self-direction. Thus, “self-transcendence” values are seen as conflicting with “self-enhancement” values and “conservation” values are seen as conflicting with “openness to change” values.====Sverdlik, Roccas, and Sagiv (2012) argue that human values provide a framework for analyzing moral principles within and across cultures. They argue that self-transcendence values are related to the concerns about justice and harm that are central to major models of moral domains. Because they promote self-interest even at the expense of others, the diametrically opposed self-enhancement values may be considered immoral. Similar arguments are in Lan et al. (2010) who hypothesize that universalism and benevolence should be positively related to moral reasoning, and power and achievement should be negatively related to moral reasoning. While Sverdlik, Roccas, and Sagiv (2012) argue that there may also be a connection between other Schwartz values and models of the moral domain, I focus on self-enhancement and self-transcendence values because they have been most consistently linked to moral reasoning or ethical judgment (see also Adams and Giannetti, 2012; Van Hoorn, 2015).====According to the moralistic theory of trust, trust in finance may erode when people have direct experiences with unethical finance professionals or when they believe finance professionals do not share the same moral code. Common accounts of the decline in trust following the financial crisis are consistent with this theory. For example, Guiso (2010) argues that the decline in trust following the crisis was a direct consequence of the unveiling of diffuse opportunistic behaviour brought about by the crisis, in particular the Madoff fraud. In a survey conducted in 2008, Sapienza and Zingales (2012) find that trust was particularly low among respondents who thought that the crisis was due to managers’ greed or bad corporate governance. These arguments suggest that in my regressions the coefficient on the interaction term between the finance professional dummy and country-level measures of trust in finance should be negative, i.e. I expect finance professionals in countries with low trust in finance to emphasize the self-enhancement values of power and achievement more and the self-transcendence values of universalism and benevolence values less than typical members of the population.====However, a greater emphasis on self-enhancement values of power and achievement values need not imply that finance professionals are immoral. Adams, Sagiv and and Licht (2011) argue that power and achievement values are entrepreneurial values associated with creating value for shareholders. Adams, Licht and Sagiv (2012) and Licht and Adams (2019) find evidence consistent with this argument in samples of directors. Given their potential role in value creation, these values may also be desirable characteristics for finance professionals to have. Relatedly, Frieze, Olson, Murrell and Selvan (2006) show that power and achievement values are correlated with future success in a longitudinal study of MBA students. Students with greater emphasis on these values worked longer hours, changed jobs more, were promoted more often and had higher salaries. Since there is evidence that the finance industry is a high skilled industry (Philippon and Reshef, 2012; Boustanifar, Grant and Reshef, 2018),==== greater power and achievement orientation may also reflect greater investments in unobservable human capital.====To address omitted variable concerns related to a “value-orientation” and unobserved human capital, I control for income in my regressions. Since a large literature argues that women have different value profiles than men (Schwartz and Rubel, 2005; Schwartz and Rubel-Lifschitz, 2009; Adams and Funk, 2012; Adams, Barber and Odean, 2017) and women are less likely to be CFAs (Adams, Barber and Odean, 2017), I also control for gender.====I include country fixed effects in the CFA sample and country-year fixed effects in the ESS to control for cultural influences on personal values and characteristics of the financial sector, other than the ones I examine directly, that may relate to both the decision to become a finance professional and trust in finance. These country fixed effects also capture country-level characteristics, like GDP, that may be related to the decision to become a CFA and values and trust. In the interaction regressions, including country or country-year fixed effects means I can no longer identify the effect of trust in finance, but I can still identify the coefficients on the interaction terms of trust with the finance professional dummy.====Consistent with expectations, the coefficient on the interaction term is generally positive in the CFA sample. Relative to the population, finance professionals appear more ethical in countries in which trust in finance is higher. To examine whether this relation could be driven by other unobserved characteristics I am not able to control for, I rerun my specifications using measures of economic attitudes towards the “efficiency versus equity trade off” (Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales, 2003 p. 227), e.g. attitudes towards income inequality, government ownership, competition, work and wealth.==== While there are significant gaps in attitudes between finance professionals and members of the population, these gaps are not systematically related to trust. Thus, I interpret my evidence for values as being consistent with the moralistic view of trust.====However, evidence from the ESS suggests that the cross-sectional evidence is not sufficient to fully characterize the relation between trust and ethics. Within a country, increases in trust are associated with a greater divergence in ethical values between finance professionals and members of the population. To investigate why the results are different across samples, I examine the role of education, which is a key dimension along which the samples differ. CFAs are all educated, while not all finance professionals in the ESS have university degrees. I show that differences in education appear to be a primary explanation for the differences in the cross-sectional and time-series results: in periods of high trust in the finance industry, e.g. the pre-crisis period, finance professionals in the ESS sample are less educated and have a less ethical value profile.====Beyond providing a link between personal values and trust in finance, my results highlight the potential importance selection plays for understanding the role of trust in the financial system. If trust is a key determinant of selection into the industry, i.e. if potential bad actors enter the finance industry when trust in finance is high, over time the positive cross-sectional relation between ethics and trust may break down. In this case, the positive effect of trust on financial development (Knack and Keefer, 1997; Guiso, Spaienza and Zingales, 2004) may also be dampened.====Since it is difficult to screen on values, my results suggest that fostering a corporate culture that attracts individuals who are willing to invest in education and certification may help build trust in finance. While having a university degree does not imply better ethics, as the example of Madoff shows, investing in education is costly and can serve as a signaling device (e.g. Spence, 1973).====Despite the importance of trust in theories of banking (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983; Diamond and Rajan, 2001), the literature on the antecedents of trust in finance is relatively small. Saparito, Chen, and Sapienza (2004) and Bertrand, Klein and Soula (2019) relate characteristics of banks to trust in banks. Stevenson and Wolfers (2011) relate the state of the business cycle to trust in institutions, including banks. Guiso (2010), Guiso (2012) and Sapienza and Zingales (2012) show that trust in finance fell following the crisis and relate the decline in trust to economic outcomes. Fungáčová, Hasan and Weill (2019) use the World Value Survey to provide the first analysis of the relationship between the characteristics of trustors and their trust in banks. Limbach, Rau and Schürmann (2020) analyze finance professionals own trust attitudes. I complement this literature by examining whether the characteristics of the people working in finance, the potential trustees, are associated with people's trust in finance.====At a broader level, my paper contributes to the literature showing that individuals with different characteristics sort into different occupations and industries for reasons that are related to the characteristics of jobs, but also the institutional, cultural and regulatory environment. Among papers that specifically focus on values, Gandal, Roccas, Sagiv, Wrzesniewski, (2005) provide evidence that the value priorities of economics students are different from those of other students. In their sample, economics students attribute more importance to self-enhancement values and less importance to universalism values than students in other fields. Adams and Ragunathan (2019) provide evidence that individual risk aversion is different in finance and high-tech industries. Adams and Giannetti (2012) compare the values of CEOs to the values of members of the population and show that CEOs place less emphasis on self-transcendence values and more emphasis on self-enhancement values.

We find that financial literacy plays an important and consistent role in financial decision-making. However, the actual behaviors are counter-intuitive: people with high levels of financial literacy tend to take too many risks, overborrow, and hold naive financial attitudes. That is, financial literacy tends to cause people to become daring and reckless toward some financial aspects. By contrast, financially literate people are better at retirement planning and are indifferent to gambling. Preferences such as risk and loss aversions and discount factors, also play a role in financial choices.","Owing to the growing need of people to save for their retirement, and the increased opportunities to undertake financial transactions as a result of the development of financial technologies, an increasing number of households face complicated financial decisions. Researchers have investigated the relationship between financial literacy and household decision-making to identify better financial education policies for individuals. They find that financial literacy is related to more investment in stocks (e.g., van Rooij et al. (2011)), higher returns (e.g., Bianchi (2018)), low-cost and moderate borrowing (e.g., Lusardi and Tufano (2015)), and better retirement planning (e.g., Sekita (2011), Clark et al. (2012), van Rooij et al. (2012), and Anderson et al. (2017)).====Recent literature also focuses on economic preferences and beliefs. Economists and psychologists have been developing experimental techniques and questionnaire methods to reveal individual preferences and beliefs and have applied them to a wide range of behaviors (e.g., Dohmen et al. (2011), Falk et al. (2018)). Since financial decisions can be risky, ambiguous, and have a long-term; they can be strongly related to nonstandard as well as standard preferences.====We investigate the effects of financial literacy and behavioral factors (i.e., preferences and beliefs) on households’ financial behaviors and attitudes, while obtaining policy implications for financial education and consumer protection. Our analyses use a purpose-built original Internet survey of 5,848 respondents aged 20–80 years, conducted in March 2018. The survey questionnaire includes financial behaviors and attitudes, knowledge (e.g., financial literacy) and skills (e.g., calculation speed), standard preferences (e.g., risk aversion and discount rate), nonstandard preferences and beliefs (e.g., loss aversion and overconfidence), and demographic factors.====A substantial amount of literature investigates the relationship between financial literacy, behavioral factors, and financial behavior.==== We build upon previous literature in four ways. First, we evaluate financial behaviors and attitudes from several viewpoints: speculative investment, share of risky assets, overborrowing, financial naivety, insufficient retirement planning, and gambling interest. Second, we identify a broad range of behavioral factors, such as the confidence gap in financial literacy, present bias, loss aversion, S-shaped probability weighting, and ambiguity aversion, as well as risk aversion and discount rate. These nonstandard preferences and beliefs are essential in analyzing financial literacy because financial literacy education is usually considered a way to prevent the irrational financial behaviors and attitudes of households. Third, we use an original purpose-built survey to apply comprehensive and accurate measures of the determinants of financial behaviors and attitudes. Ten financial questions were formulated to measure financial literacy, while incentivized questions were formulated to measure calculation speed and risk aversion. Fourth, the marginal effects of financial literacy on financial behaviors is not assumed to be constant; that is, we allow the effects of financial learning is different between novices and experts.====The regression results surprisingly show that high levels of financial literacy is associated with inappropriate financial behaviors and attitudes, such as speculative investment, overborrowing, and financial naivety. Thus, financial literacy tends to cause people to become daring and reckless in some financial aspects. In contrast, financially literate people are better at retirement planning and are indifferent to gambling.====The significant effects of the confidence gap in financial literacy show that financial choices are determined by participants’ “perceived” and actual financial literacy. Moreover, a higher discount rate is associated with overborrowing, insufficient retirement planning, and increased gambling interest, whereas it leads to less financial naivety. Other behavioral factors generally tend to cause people to be less daring and reckless financially: present bias, risk aversion, loss aversion, S-shaped probability weighting, and ambiguity aversion.====Our results are especially noteworthy because the introduction of financial education into secondary education is under consideration in some countries, including Japan. It is true that young people are less financially literate than their elderly counterparts. While financial literacy is widely believed to be effective in preventing households from making inappropriate financial decisions, our results show the possibility of it leading to more inappropriate behaviors and attitudes, which has important implications for financial education.====We also show that the determinants of financial behavior are associated with age and gender. The high level of financial knowledge of elderly males can be a contributing factor to financial fraud vulnerability and excessive risk-taking. Males tend to be more financially literate, confident, and higher on discount rate than females on average. Younger generations are financially illiterate and less experienced while also less underconfident about financial literacy, and low on discount rate.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Using unforeseen changes in the CAP that occurred due to the electoral results as a source of exogenous variation in income in the early 2010s, this paper examines the causal impact of family income on households’ private educational expenditures and child outcomes in the short-run, based on a longitudinal parent-child survey. The ordinary least squares (OLS) and first-differenced (FD) results show that family income is in most cases positively correlated with child's cognitive outcomes, and, to a lesser extent, with families’ educational expenditure on their children. Based on the FD instrumental variable (FD-IV) estimation, using unexpected changes in CAP payments as an instrument, we find positive income effects on educational expenditure in the short-run. However, we did not find statistically significant impacts on children's cognitive outcomes.","Many countries have relied on cash transfer programs to improve the well-being of the children of low-income families and to circumvent the cycle of poverty trap across generations. The cash transfer program is supported by the belief that part of an additional income will be used as human capital investment in the health or education of children, which is difficult under the credit constraint created by low income.==== However, because most previous research was based on programs of developing countries, it is not clear how much additional income would be invested in children and would effectively enhance their human capital in developed countries.====The Child Allowance Policy (CAP) in Japan, which is a nationwide cash transfer program to families with children, has also been designed for the purpose of increasing expenditure for these children. In this paper, we use CAP in order to identify the causal effect of income on a child's education expenditure and children's outcomes using the unique data. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigated the effect of CAP on children.====Since the Coleman Report (Coleman et al., 1966), much research effort has been devoted to determining the factors (both at school and among families) that influence the outcomes of children the most. One variable that has been the major focus of economic research is household income. Virtually all previous research has found a positive association between household income and children's outcomes (Duncan and Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Mayer, 1997). The simplest human capital theory, however, predicts that under the complete market assumption, the amount of educational investment does not directly depend on the household's income level (Becker, 1962). Many researchers have questioned the complete market assumption and have examined whether households with low incomes face borrowing constraints and thereby have difficulty investing in their children's human capital. These studies have typically focused on children's college enrollment (Carneiro and Heckman, 2002; Keane, 2002; Cameron and Taber, 2004; Belley and Lochner, 2007).====The major challenge in attempting to identify the causal impact of family income on educational investment and child outcomes is the endogeneity of income. Family income is generally correlated with parental educational achievement, which is likely to be correlated with parents’ and children's unobserved abilities (Duncan and Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Mayer, 1997). Furthermore, some important factors contributing to child outcomes, such as home environments, parenting practices, and cultural backgrounds, are not always observable to researchers. Failing to control for these unobserved factors, which are correlated with family income as well as educational investment and children's outcomes, results in a bias in the estimation of the effect of family income.====In a vast literature, researchers have sought to disentangle the effects of unobservable factors and family income using various methods. Except for a few experimental studies,==== most researchers have used panel data of the same families and children that include information on family backgrounds, such as family income, and children's outcomes. Early studies used child fixed effects to identify the effect of transitory income on child outcomes (Duncan et al., 1998; Blau, 1999). However, family income can be endogenous even after controlling for child fixed effects. For example, if a child has a developmental problem, parents might increase the time spend on their child and reduce their working hours. Changes in parental time allocation would then coincide with a reduction in family income, causing reverse causality issues.====Currently, a more prominent approach is to find an exogenous variation of family income due to a policy reform or economic event that is uncorrelated with unobservable factors. This approach has generated conflicting results. Among others, Løken (2010) used the economic boom of the 1970s and 1980s—caused by the discovery of oil fields in Norway—as an instrumental variable (IV) for an increase in income and found no effect on children's outcomes. Akee et al. (2010) used the opening of a casino in North Carolina that benefitted a subpopulation in the area (Native American tribes) and found that it raised children's educational achievements and lowered their probability of committing crimes. Changes in tax and welfare policies have also been used as exogenous sources of variation in income. For example, Dahl and Lochner (2012) used changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the United States and showed that increased earnings improved the test scores of children in families subject to this policy change.====The main contribution of this paper is the estimation of the causal effects of family income on the households’ private educational expenditure and child outcomes (academic test scores).==== We used changes in the Child Allowance Policy (CAP) in Japan that occurred in the early 2010s as an exogenous source of income variation. The CAP is unique because it is a nationwide program that is not limited to low-income households or working households, allowing us to examine the income effects for entire households with children from a broader range of income distribution. This is in contrast to previous studies that investigated the impact of transfer policies, such as the EITC in the US, with a primary focus on low-income households (Gregg et al., 2006; Dahl and Lochner, 2012). Addressing the effects of income changes on each child's educational expenditures and the child's outcomes is another unique feature of this study as few previous studies have estimated both pathways on a common data set.==== Although we do not attempt to estimate the causal effect of educational expenditure on children's outcomes, obtaining the causal effects of income on both expenditure and outcomes provides valuable information regarding the channel through which family income may influence children, facilitating the interpretation of the results.====Another contribution of this paper is the policy evaluation of the recent changes in the CAP from the perspective of child outcomes. Several previous studies have examined the effect of the CAP on consumption patterns (Kobayashi, 2011; Unayama, 2011), the mental health of parents (Takaku, 2015), the labor supply (Bessho, 2018), and household wealth accumulation (Stephens and Unayama, 2015). To our knowledge, however, no previous research has examined the effect of the CAP on households’ educational expenditures and direct measures of children's educational outcomes, which are the primary targets of the policy. More broadly, this paper presents the first empirical evidence on the effect of an unconditional cash transfer program on households’ educational expenditures and child outcomes in the Japanese context.====Our identification strategy relies on the largely exogenous, discontinuous changes in the CAP in Japan that took place between 2010 and 2012. Before 2010, a child aged 12 or younger was eligible for the allowance. A monthly allowance was determined based on children's age and birth order. In 2010, the government substantially expanded the amount and scope of the allowance. A child aged 15 or younger became eligible for the allowance, which was 13,000 JPY (approximately, $US120) per month, independent of the child's age. The current policy, from 2012, provides a monthly allowance again based on children's age and birth order.====The policy changes described above provide a nearly ideal situation for identifying the income effects on children's outcomes for several reasons. First, policy changes were most likely unanticipated by families since they were a result of a regime change (from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan to the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)) after the national lower-house election during one of the most volatile and unstable political periods after World War II in Japan. Second, a monthly allowance payment is solely determined based on the number and ages of the existing children in the family, which cannot be controlled by individual households. Under other redistribution policies, such as the EITC in the United States, families can endogenously change their behavior to manipulate the benefits or subsidies they receive from the policy. Altogether, we believe that changes in the CAP can provide an exogenous source of variation in income.====The ordinary least squares (OLS) results show that, in most cases, family income is positively correlated with families’ educational expenditure and children's cognitive outcomes. By controlling for child fixed effects, the first-differenced (FD) results show that the income coefficient is positive and statistically significant only for mathematics and combined test scores. Based on the FD instrumental variable (FD-IV) estimation, using unexpected changes in CAP payments as an instrument, we found significantly positive income effects on educational expenditure even in the short-run but did not find statistically significant impacts on children's cognitive outcomes.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the institutional background of the CAP in Japan. Section 3 provides a brief description of the dataset used in our empirical analysis. Section 4 sets out our identification strategy based on exogenous variations in family income due to policy changes and provides the empirical specification.

The higher the value of ACRI, the greater the difference between the sets of technical measures in the destination and origin countries. Employing the ACRI, we estimate the impact on trade of regulatory burdens via product-level bilateral gravity equations. We find a significant negative impact of regulatory burdens on bilateral trade for a full sample, but the estimated trade effects vary across sectors and depend on the development levels of the trading countries.","In the last few decades, international trade has increased tremendously through reductions in import tariffs. However, the current indication is that global trade will slow down, partly because of the rise in protectionist policies around the world. Therefore, the potential trade-restrictive or discriminatory effect of non-tariff measures (NTMs) is becoming even more important. NTMs cover any policy measures other than import tariffs that are implemented at or behind the national border, potentially affecting the price of traded products, the quantity traded, or both. In particular, standards and technical regulations, such as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and technical barriers to trade (TBT), have been subjects of interest for researchers, policymakers, and businesses.==== To export to another country, an exporter firm, as well as the original manufacturers or producers, must comply with technical requirements in place in the destination country, otherwise imported products can be rejected at the border if they fail to meet these requirements.====Nevertheless, comprehensive empirical research on assessing the impact of technical measures on international trade has been minimal.==== This is because it has been difficult to conduct a systematic study of technical measures due to the lack of internationally comparable data on technical measures and other NTMs at finely disaggregated product level that are suitably coded to be used in empirical analysis. Traditionally, the trade-restricting effect of NTMs has been computed as the ad valorem equivalents (AVEs) based on the partial correlation between the presence of NTMs at the destination country-product level and the trade values (e.g., Kee, Nicita, and Olarreaga 2009). In this vein of approach relying on dummy variables marking the presence of NTMs in the destination country, the issue of NTMs is implied but not addressed specifically. The estimated AVEs indicate the net trade restrictiveness on the whole concerning imports of a given product but does not reveal where the restrictiveness might arise.====Looking merely at the presence of NTMs enforced in the export destination is especially problematic if a product is subject to technical requirements in both the origin and destination countries of a given trade flow. In most countries, governments adopt mandatory regulatory norms in one form or another to ensure the health and safety of its citizens and environment. To achieve the policy objective, technical measures tend to be similar across countries because such measures are of the most appropriate ways based on scientific findings. From the exporter's point of view, they might not substantially face ‘additional’ regulatory requirements when exporting in addition to domestic production and sales. Thus, what is important for exporter firms is not the mere presence of measures in the destination country, but the existence of ‘additional’ requirements.====Indeed, as shown below, on average, products imported from a particular country into a particular destination market is subject to five different types of technical measures in combination even at the finely disaggregated product level. Moreover, a set of technical measures enforced in a destination country against imports from a particular country is often overlapped by a set of the origin country's domestic measures. Given these observed facts in mind, we construct the additional compliance requirement indicator (ACRI) to quantify the ==== regulatory burdens that an exporter firm may face when serving the foreign country's market. Since our measure is constructed from exporter's point of view, ACRI is also asymmetrical between countries, depending on whether they are identified as an importer or an exporter.====The construction of the ACRI requires detailed information on technical measures in many countries. This study uses a new database created by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in collaboration with many other entities.==== This database contains a description of each mandatory regulation, which is enforced by the national legislation, along with the measure type coded according to the UNCTAD's NTM classification, the affected products specified at the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) six-digit level, and the country codes for the imposing and affected countries.==== Utilizing these detailed information, we can construct the ACRI and estimate the impact of technical measures on international trade more precisely, with due consideration for compliance costs.====We estimate the impact on trade of the regulatory burdens placed on exporter firms via product-level bilateral gravity equations, considering various types of technical measures enforced against HS six-digit products in 48 countries in the year 2015. The ACRI of our interest, taking a value between 0 and 1, captures the additional compliance requirements implied by a set of technical measures in the destination market that constitute the market entry and trade costs faced by exporter firms. First, we show an overall negative impact of ACRI on bilateral trade values at the product level. Our estimates imply that an increase in ACRI of 0.1 will on average reduce the trade value by 1.5–2.3%. Second, by examining income groups of the destination and origin countries of bilateral trade flows, we find that exporting firms of developed countries are not affected by the extra regulatory burdens in developing countries. In contrast, the trade-diminishing effect of regulatory burdens appears to be more worrisome for developing countries. Third, the trade effects of regulatory burdens vary in magnitude and signs among industry groups. The adverse effect is most noticeable for foodstuffs and machinery sectors.====Outside the aforementioned literature estimating AVEs, most of recent empirical research on the trade consequences of NTMs attempt to assess the forgone (or enhanced) trade linked to technical measures in a gravity equation. Among those concerning the costs of complying with foreign technical requirements faced by exporter firms, however, the past studies tend to either have a narrow focus or rely on the simple counting at the aggregate level to quantify technical requirements. First, some studies narrowly focus on product-specific measures such as stringency of maximum residue levels (MRLs) (e.g., Disdier and Marette 2010; Xiong and Beghin 2014) while others conduct single-sector or single-country analyses of product standards and regulations (Bao 2014; Portugal-Perez, Reyes, and Wilson 2010). Even an exceptional study by Crivelli and Groeschl (2016) that examines bilateral trade flows at the HS four-digit level among a large number of countries, focuses only on the impact of SPS-related concerns on agricultural and food sectors, using the WTO database for specific trade concerns (STCs) reported by exporters. These studies generally find that product-specific regulations diminish trade while international harmonization of standards enhances trade, but may not be representative.====Second, Bao and Qiu (2012) and Bao and Chen (2013) examine bilateral trade flows aggregated over sectors, using the total number of TBT notifications by respective countries to the WTO in order to quantify the technical requirements and their trade effect. Since governments impose diverse regulations in combination even at the finely disaggregated level, simply adding up the counted numbers of notifications over various sectors appears to be less informative in quantifying the overall degree of technical requirements. Furthermore, since the implementation pattern of combining diverse regulations varies across countries with different legislative systems, the expected impact of the simple count variable on trade is ambiguous. A similar concern arises about the use of a frequency ratio, which measures the number of product items subject to regulations within a given sector (Bao 2014; Crivelli and Groeschl 2016).====This study overcomes these two limitations in the literature by proposing the ACRI to approximate the overall regulatory burdens due to diverse technical measures enforced in combination. Using the UNCTAD NTM database, we are able to construct the ACRI at the destination-origin-product level and assess the impact of regulatory burdens on trade flows in a wide range of products, sectors and countries. The related studies often use either notification-based data, which covers only new measures upon legislative amendments, or STCs data, which covers only the restrictive regulations that are perceived as sizable trade barriers by exporters. In contrast, we employ the UNCTAD NTM database, which theoretically covers the universe of technical measures in many countries. As far as we know, there are a handful studies using the newly constructed UNCTAD data according to the new NTM classification: published articles include Niu et al. (2018), which estimates AVEs, and Webb et al. (2020), which explores the impact of NTMs on supply chains in a computable general equilibrium modelling framework; related ongoing works include Cadot et al. (2015) and Nabeshima and Obashi (2019), which proposes, respectively, a measure of the regulatory distance and dissimilarity of NTM regimes between countries, and Disdier, Gaigné, and Herghelegiu (2018) on the quality effects of standards on exporter firms.====Our proposed ACRI complements the earlier studies that propose summary indicators to evaluate regulatory differences between countries at the product level as an alternative to the conventional count variable and frequency ratio. Drogué and DeMaria (2012), for example, use Pearson's distance to measure the dissimilarity between vectors representing a series of MRLs set on apples and pears. Although the Drogué and DeMaria (2012)’s indicator is calculated to be symmetric between a given pair of countries, Winchester et al. (2012) propose a directional indicator to capture the relative stringency of a series of MRLs affecting animal and plant products in the destination compared to the origin country of each trade flow. Departing from these indicators building on the quantitative information of MRLs, our proposed ACRI is intended to quantify the overall degree of regulatory burdens implied by the qualitative information on the list of technical measures described in various legal documents.====The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the underlying data on NTMs and details the general state of technical measures implemented around the world. Section 3 explains the motivations and methodologies used to construct the ACRI. Section 4 uses the ACRI to estimate the impact of regulatory burdens on bilateral trade flows, and section 5 concludes.",Impact of Regulatory Burdens on International Trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158320300575,5 December 2020,2020,Research Article,61.0

While many victims died immediately or within a few years of the bombing, there were many negative effects on survivors in terms of both health and social/economic aspects that could last many years. Of these two life factors, health and social/economic aspects, the latter has largely been ignored by researchers. We investigate possible long-lasting effects using a new dataset covering the middle and older generations in Hiroshima some 60 years after the tragedy. Our empirical results show that Atomic Bomb Survivors did not necessarily suffer unfavorable life experiences in terms of the average marriage status or educational attainment but did experience significant disadvantages some aspects including the husband/wife combination of married couples, work status, mental health, and expectations for the future. Thus, survivors have suffered for many years after the catastrophe itself.","On the clear, peaceful, and ordinary morning of August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb was delivered from the U.S. military plane ==== to the center of the city of Hiroshima in Japan. The bomb exploded at an altitude of 600 meters and released a tremendous and harmful amount of severe radiation, heat rays, overwhelming force and heat of the blasts with a large fireball.====This was the first time in human history for a nuclear weapon to be used for indiscriminate and immediate mass killing and destruction. Indeed, the number of acute deaths from the bomb is estimated to be between 90,000 to 166,000 persons, a significant proportion of Hiroshima city's total population of 340,000-350,000 citizens.==== This number of acute deaths includes the deaths that were instant as well as those who died within two to four months after the bombing attributable to radiation exposure, i.e. fallout called ====. The number of survivors who declared themselves as having been exposed to radiation, called ==== in Japanese, both in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was counted to be approximately 280,000 persons in the national census administered in 1950 by the government.====A tremendous and intensive volume of research on the effect of the atomic bombing conducted mainly by scholars and researchers in natural science immediately followed the tragic event. The focus of the research has been mainly the aftereffects of radiation exposure on health, especially the incidence of various cancers and leukemia. Indeed, a specialized research institute, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, (ABCC), was established in Hiroshima in March 1947 (and the one in Nagasaki was established in 1948). In order to examine long-term effects on death and the incidence of cancers caused by the radiation exposure, the ABCC started a longitudinal study in October 1950 on approximately 120,000 persons at the baseline as the ==== and related studies. These studies have been ongoing for more than 60 years, even after the ABCC was reorganized as Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) in April 1975.==== The findings from those surveys are summarized as follows: 1) cancers of specific organs are more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. Second, 2) non-cancer diseases (cataract, benign thyroid tumor, heart disease, stroke), deterioration of the immune system similar to that observed with aging, and minor inflammatory reactions are more likely observed in survivors exposed to high doses of radiation; and 3) neither genetic effect nor an increase in mortality or incidence of cancer have been confirmed to date among survivors’ children.====In contrast to the large and intensive volume of medical/epidemiological studies on health of survivors and their children, surprisingly, there has been scarce research on social/economic aspects caused by radiation exposure due to the atomic bombing in social science. There is no reason that negative effects caused by the atomic bombing would be limited to health aspects of survivors. In fact, the atomic bombing could have long-term effects on life events of affected individuals. A noteworthy example is social discrimination against survivors, either explicit or implicit; for example, a survivor could not get married, attain desirable education, or gain a good job by the fact or even a simple prejudgment that he/she was exposed to radiation by the atomic bombing. In other words, aftereffects of the atomic bombing could be observed in survivors’ life events such as educational attainment, employment, and family formation. Thus, besides potential health/medical issues, such adverse effects could be found in economic/social sources over a lifetime.====This study provides new evidence on long-term effects of the atomic bombing in 1945 on survivors and their children. We collected a variety of information on health, family, employment, and residential status from individuals who were randomly selected in the city of Hiroshima in 2011 with a supplemental survey in 2017. In this study, we aim to contribute to the scarce amount of existing literature in three ways. First, we examine long-term evidence on aftereffects of survivors and their children in a variety of aspects. More than 70 years have passed since the bombing and those who were directly affected are very advanced in age. Thus, now we can examine long-term and nearly comprehensive consequences of the atomic bombing in 1945 on the course of life of individuals. Second, we examine comprehensive outcomes of the radiation exposure, focusing on any negative effects on social/individual aspects quantitatively, which to date have hardly been examined. Most of this line of research thus far, which is described in the next section, relies on a small sample of case-study interviews, but those findings are hard to generalize. Instead, we utilize a new survey on Hiroshima citizens to detect any disadvantages experienced by survivors. Third, we provide quantitative evidence on any gaps between the affected (survivors and their children) and others and thus we fill the gap between statistical evidence and knowledge based on in-depth interview of a small sample size of individuals.====This paper proceeds as follows. ==== provides a brief description of previous literature on the atomic bombing and related studies. ==== explains the dataset used in the empirical analysis. ==== performs a descriptive comparison between the affected and the non-affected by the atomic bombing and ==== specifically examines the combination of married couples.

We document heterogeneous changes in employment and earnings in response to the COVID-19 shocks, observed in various data sources during the initial months after the onset of the pandemic in Japan. We then feed these shocks into a life-cycle model of heterogeneous agents to quantify welfare consequences of the COVID-19 shocks. In each dimension of the heterogeneity, the shocks are amplified for those who earned less prior to the crisis. Contingent workers are hit harder than regular workers, younger workers than older workers, females than males, and workers engaged in social and non-flexible jobs than those in ordinary and flexible jobs. The most severely hurt by the COVID-19 shocks has been a group of female, contingent, low-skilled workers, engaged in social and non-flexible jobs and without a spouse of a different group.","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant shocks to the labor markets all over the world, and Japan is no exception. While Japan did not see a sharp increase in unemployment rate immediately after the onset of crisis, which stood at 2.6% in April 2020, compared to other countries such as 14.9% in the United States in April 2020, shocks in the labor market are spread highly unequally across workers.==== In this paper, we first document heterogeneous responses in employment and earnings to the COVID-19 shocks observed during the initial months after the onset of the crisis in Japan. We then feed these shocks in the labor market into a life-cycle model of heterogeneous agents to quantify welfare consequences of the COVID-19 shocks.====Despite the relatively small change in the overall unemployment rate, we find that negative effects of the COVID-19 shocks significantly differ across individual workers, in various dimensions including age group, gender, employment type, education level, occupation, and industry. Moreover, in each dimension, the shock is larger for those who earned less prior to outbreak of the pandemic, amplifying inequality in the labor market across multiple dimensions.====To quantify welfare effects from the COVID-19 shocks, we build a life-cycle model and let heterogeneous individuals face unexpected changes to their earnings and employment, as observed in the data, and have them re-optimize in response to the shocks. We evaluate welfare effects on different types of individuals in terms of consumption equivalent variation that would make them as better off as before in the economy without the COVID-19 shocks.====Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, contingent workers suffer significantly, up to more than three times as much as regular workers in terms of our welfare measure. They are more severely hurt in both employment and wages than regular workers, and we find that employment type is one of the most critical dimensions that divides the fate of individuals in the labor market after the crisis. Second, we also find that younger generations suffer more than older generations. Third, female workers fare worse than males. The difference is mainly due to the fact that the share of contingent workers is larger for females, but also because females are more concentrated in jobs that are more severely affected by the COVID-19 shocks. Forth, workers in social sectors and/or non-flexible occupations suffer more. The COVID-19 crisis differs from past recessions such as the financial crisis of 2008 in that it contracts economic activities in sectors that involve more face-to-face transactions and occupations involving tasks difficult to be completed remotely from homes or in physical isolation from other people. Kikuchi et al. (2020) discussed heterogeneous vulnerability across occupations and industries and pointed to risks of rising inequality, which we confirm has manifested in wage and employment changes across workers in the data during the first months after the crisis.====We also stress a caution in the interpretation of our quantitative results. As discussed above, the main focus of our paper is to assess changes in the labor market during the initial months after the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, which we observed in various official data, and to quantify welfare implications from these observations. For this purpose, we build a simple life-cycle model of heterogeneous agents that enables us to focus on the analysis of these effects in the short-run. There is, however, significant uncertainty about whether various shocks we currently observe will be short-lived or long-lived and whether they will be repeated multiple times over years to come. We evaluate welfare effects under some scenarios about the duration of shocks and our results may need to be re-examined when more data is available and there is less uncertainty as to the magnitude and the duration of the pandemic.====Moreover, there may well be other structural changes in the economy that the COVID-19 crisis may induce over the medium and long-run. There are also many changes that the Japanese economy had been going through, including changes in the composition of employment type and gender-specific involvement in the labor market, aging demographics, fiscal challenges associated with rising expenditures on the social insurance system. The COVID-19 crisis may interact with these changes and possibly amplify challenges that Japan is faced with in some dimensions, or hopefully mitigate them in other dimensions. Although we acknowledge these topics and potential consequences of the COVID-19 crises in the medium and long-term as very important and worth exploring, they are not in the scope of the current analysis, and our model intentionally abstracts from them. Our focus is on a quantitative evaluation of shocks in the labor market immediately after the crisis hit the economy, and we do not explicitly discuss or evaluate specific policies.====Numerous studies have emerged that investigate heterogeneous consequences of the COVID-19 shocks on individuals and implications for welfare and policies, which include but are not limited to Acemoglu et al. (2020), Alon et al. (2020a), Glover et al. (2020), Kaplan et al. (2020b), and Albanesi et al. (2020), just to name a few.==== Our study complements the literature by documenting facts and analyzing welfare consequences in Japan.====This paper is also complementary to studies of various economic aspects of the COVID-19 shocks in Japan. They include Fukui et al. (2020) on the impact of pandemic on job vacancy postings, Watanabe and Omori (2020) on consumption responses across sectors, Miyakawa et al. (2020) on firm default, Kawata (2020) on occupational and spatial mismatch, Kawaguchi et al. (2020) on uncertainty faced by small and medium-sized firms, and Okubo (2020) on implementation of telework across occupations.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In two extreme cases in which the recent sales reduction has a full or no impact on firms’ expectations for future sales, firm exits increased by ==== and ==== respectively. Third, these increases are mainly due to the decrease in the expected sales growth rate, rather than the increase in uncertainty. Finally, we quantify the hypothetical amount of government subsidies needed to prevent excess increases in potential firm exits, which is around ==== of Japan’s GDP.","To study the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on firm exits, we use firm-level data for Japan provided by Tokyo Shoko Research (TSR). On the one hand, the TSR data are novel, in that they cover a wide range of firms in Japan and include information on when and why firms exited from the market. On the other hand, a caveat is that recent TSR data for 2020 track only relatively large-sized bankruptcy cases, ignoring voluntary exits and small-sized bankruptcies. Therefore, it is not straightforward to examine recent firm exits.====Given this data constraint, to evaluate the number of firm exits during the COVID-19 pandemic, we first construct a simple model following ==== (see also ====Our simulation results show that, first, sizable heterogeneity in terms of exit numbers and rates exists across ==== and regions. The hospitality industry (i.e., accommodation, eating, and drinking services) shows the largest increase in firm exit rate, while large cities, such as Osaka and Tokyo, suffered from the largest increase in the number of firm exits.====Second, in aggregate, the pandemic potentially increased firm exits by around ==== compared to the previous year. This number is obtained under the assumption that the recent reduction in firm sales is temporary and, thus, partially (i.e., ==== meaning the pandemic would dampen sales growth over two years) incorporated into firms’ sales trend expectations. In an extreme case, in which firms assume the recent drop in sales is permanent and thus the sales reduction has a full impact (i.e., 100%) on their sales trend expectations, firm exits would increase by ====. In another extreme case, in which firms consider the recent sales decreases as purely transitory, thus causing no impact on their sales trend expectations, firm exits would increase by ====. Our decomposition study shows that the increase in firm exits is mainly due to the decrease in the expected growth rates of firm sales, rather than the increase in uncertainty.====Our model-based study could be useful for providing policy guidelines, specifically on rescue plans. Governments worldwide implemented various financial rescue measures for firms in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these measures should be addressed to firms that have only temporary difficulties. Such a policy would have been inefficient if governments rescued unprofitable firms before the pandemic (called zombies by ====). In this regard, it is essential to identify the causes of firm exits and the number of firms predicted to exit the market given the current economic downturn. In our simulation, we calculated the potential number and rate of firm exiting the market by keeping the exit option value unchanged. In reality, the exit option value likely changed because of institutional background changes, such as delayed bankruptcy procedures and government rescue measures, which would have decreased firm exits to some extent. Although the lack of comprehensive data on recent firm exits prevents us from estimating a timely exit option value during the pandemic, our model enables us to quantify the hypothetical amount of government subsidies needed to prevent excess increases in potential firm exits. We find that subsidies amount to around ==== of Japan’s GDP.====Empirical studies on firm exit include ====, ====, and ====. ==== show that exiting firms experience poor performance for several years before exiting the market, which provides the basis for our model. For Japan, studies in this area are ====, ====, ====, and ====. Our study contributes to the literature in that we structurally estimate firms’ exit decisions by constructing a simple model of the optimal stopping time. Moreover, our study focuses on the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Despite mounting concerns about firm exits during the COVID-19 pandemic, few studies seem to exist on this topic. See ==== for a preliminary study on the effects of confinement on firm bankruptcy in Japan.

It also assesses the effect of robot adoption on the relation between aging and productivity using industrial level data. We find that aging is negatively associated with labor productivity and TFP growth. This is true particularly when aging is measured by increases in shares of old workers. If aging is measured by increases in the median age of workers, the negative effect is weaker. Evidence also suggests that robot technology mitigates aging's negative effect on productivity growth, particularly when productivity is measured by TFP. However, there is no evidence that robots are more heavily adopted in aged ====. While robot technology does not directly contribute to higher productivity growth, our findings suggest that the robot adoption can alleviate the negative impact of aging by helping workers in their 50s and 60s contribute less adversly to productivity growth.","The Republic of Korea is among the world's fastest aging economies. In 2017, 14.0% of its people were aged 65 and above, and by 2060 this age group is expected to reach 41.0% of the population (KOSIS 2016). In this same cohort, the share of those aged 80 or over is expected to reach 44.3% in 2060, indicating that aging of the already aged population is also accelerating rapidly (KOSIS 2016). This raises questions about whether advanced aging hurts productivity and how it does so, which are particularly relevant to the Republic of Korea.====Economic literature has emphasized the negative effect of aging on productivity. Feyrer (2007)—who investigated the effect of aging on productivity—finds (using a sample of 87 non-oil countries) that aging lowers aggregate productivity growth by decreasing the share of the workforce between the ages of 40 and 49. Productivity is highest at these ages. Maestas et al. (2016) (using US state data) and Aiyar et al. (2016) (using European country data) also find that aging undermines productivity growth, in that different age groups contribute to productivity growth differently. Ilmakunnas and Miyakoshi (2013), however, find that, among the low skilled, aging hurts productivity, even as it is a positive driver among the high skilled.====Nonetheless, recent studies note that the negative effects of aging on productivity and economic growth are not preordained. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) argue that population aging can promote productivity growth by encouraging more active adoption of robot technology.====Are rapid aging and rapid robot adoption related? The Republic of Korea leads the world in industrial robot adoption. The country recorded 631 robots per 10,000 employees in the manufacturing industry in 2016, by far the highest in the world (Fig. 1). Singapore, Germany, and Japan follow, in that order; Germany ranked third, with less than half the number of robots as the Republic of Korea. Indeed, the Republic of Korea has used the most robots since 2010, according to the International Federation of Robotics’ World Robot Statistics.====Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) argue theoretically and document empirically that aging leads to more intensive use and development of robots. Using US data, they find that robots substitute for middle-aged workers==== and that productivity increases relatively in industries that are most amenable to automation. Abeliansky and Prettner (2017) also provide a theoretical model that predicts that countries with low population growth introduce automation technologies earlier and supporting empirical evidence based on 60 countries during 1993–2013. Graetz and Michaels (2018) also find that increased robot use raises labor productivity and total factor productivity (TFP) and lowers output prices. They find that while robot use reduces low-skilled workers’ share, it does not reduce total employment. Autor (2015) strongly argues that automation not only substitutes for labor, but also increases demand for labor by increasing productivity. That said, Basso and Jimeno (2018) introduce an alternative model that suggests the contrary. According to their model, a trade-off exists between innovation and automation and, while aging boosts automation, because automation crowds out innovation, aging and its consequence, i.e., automation, thus lower GDP growth per capita.====The interactions between aging and technology and their impact on productivity and growth are an area which has not yet been fully investigated in the literature. In particular, today's older populations are different from yesterday's older populations. They are healthier, more educated, and likely benefit from rapid technological advances, which transforms the nature of work. It is still unclear which direction is working. Is it aging that accelerates adoption of technology, especially automation? Or is it technology adoption or automation which allows aging workers to stay in the workforce and help maintain their productivity?====This paper contributes to this growing literature by examining the Republic of Korea's experience and providing empirical evidence in two important areas. First, we revisit the impact of an aging population on productivity, which is measured by labor productivity or TFP based on the country's industrial level data. Second, we empirically investigate the effect of robot adoption on the relation between aging and productivity, again based on the country's industrial level data. In other words, we inquire into whether robot adoption mitigates the adverse impact, if any, of aging on productivity growth.====We find that aging is negatively associated with labor productivity or TFP growth. This is true particularly when aging is measured by increases in shares of old workers. If aging is measured by increases in the median age of workers, the evidence of aging's negative effect is weaker. There is also some evidence that the adoption of robot technology mitigates aging's negative effect on productivity growth, particularly when productivity is measured by TFP. However, there is no evidence that robots are more heavily adopted in the industries with a share of old workers increasing relatively faster than in other industries.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We show that listed firms invest more and have greater sensitivity to investment opportunities than comparable unlisted companies. Our findings suggest that the role of listing in alleviating financial constraints and agency costs is more important than potential underinvestment due to myopic behavior. However, the positive relationship between listing and investment is primarily driven by standalone firms. Further analysis confirms that as the number of subsidiaries in a business group increases the positive impact of listing on investment declines. Additionally, we find that the positive impact of listing on investment is greater for financially constrained firms. We also document a positive association between stock liquidity and investment for listed firms. Taken together, our results suggest that stock markets play an important role in easing financial constraints and preventing managerial shirking both of which increase investment. Finally, we show that higher levels of ownership by ====, board members, and foreign investors increases corporate investment.","Does being listed on a stock exchange influence long-term investment? Existent literature suggests it does. On one hand, listing may reduce long-term investment. It is often argued that listing induces short-term pressures on management which leads to myopic managerial behavior which reduces long-term investment (Stein, 1989). On the other hand, listing gives a firm access to public capital markets. Access to public capital markets should reduce the cost of capital, which should increase investment of a listed firm relative to an unlisted one. Recent empirical literature is mixed. Asker et al. (2015) show that short-term market pressures cause lower investment levels for listed firms relative to unlisted firms. However, Bakke et al. (2012) find that stock market listing increases investment. The authors argue that the liquidity benefit for public companies induces them to invest more than private companies. Gilje and Taillard (2016) show that private firms are less responsive to investment opportunities compared to public firms. They suggest that access to capital is important in explaining differences between investment of public and private firms.====Building on this literature, we conduct a large sample comparison of investment behavior by large Japanese listed and unlisted companies from 2001 to 2017. Existing research primarily focuses on differences between public and private firms. However, these comparisons are susceptible to confounding effects due to different disclosure requirements. While listed firms are required to comply with the listing criteria of the stock exchange and regulatory agencies, generally private firms are required to disclose at a much lower level.====We overcome this problem by taking advantage of institutional characteristics of the Financial Instruments Exchange Act (J-FIEA, hereafter) of Japan. J-FIEA mandates all firms whose equity satisfies certain criteria to file financial statements that are the Japanese counterpart of 10-K filing (J 10-K, hereafter).==== Interestingly, firms that are required to file financial statements include not only public listed firms but also many unlisted firms. Additionally, since our sample of unlisted firms are required to report consolidated financial statements and full format of J 10-K, we can collect the data on governance and ownership structure that are at the same level as listed firms. These unique features allow us to isolate the impact of listing on investment without the confounding effects created by different disclosure requirements and ownership structures. Simple comparisons between public and private firms might be misleading when attempting to isolate the effect of listing status on investment. Potential governance differences between listed and unlisted firms may confounded the impact of listing on investment. One of the strengths of our study is that we avoid this issue by controlling for ownership structure, which produces a clearer test of the impact of listing on investment.====We find that listed firms invest more and are more sensitive to investment opportunities than their unlisted counterparts. This result suggests that listing status alleviates financial constraints and reduces agency costs which increases investment in Japan. Our findings contrast with the hypothesis that market pressure exerted on listed firms induces myopic behavior by management and reduces investment relative to unlisted firms (Asker et al., 2015). Further analysis reveals that the positive relationship between listing and investment is not due to overinvestment by listed firms, but rather underinvestment by unlisted firms.====Next, we investigate how firm structure impacts investment behavior of listed and unlisted firms. We divide our sample into two sub-samples: 1) Firms that are members of business groups, and 2) standalone firms. We show that the positive relationship between listing and investment is primarily driven by standalone firms. Additional analysis confirms that as the number of subsidiaries in a business group increases the positive impact of listing on investment declines. In a series of additional tests, we show that the positive role of listing on investment is particularly important for financially constrained firms. Providing additional evidence that higher levels of investment by listed firms is not due to overinvestment.====In most cases, we show that higher ownership by financial institutions and foreign investors increases investment, potentially mitigating financial constraints in the case of financial institutions. Alternatively, these types shareholders may monitor management, which reduces managerial shirking and thereby increases investment. Indeed, we find that the positive impact of foreign investors on investment is greater for listed firms. Finally, we examine the role of stock liquidity on listed firm investment. We show that liquidity enhances the positive relationship between listing and investment, particularly in the business group subsample. This finding suggests that liquid stocks act as a monitor of management reducing shirking and producing higher levels of investment. Additionally, liquid stocks make raising additional capital easier, which facilitates investment. Overall, our results have implications for understanding corporate investment throughout the world, give the prevalence of business groups in many developed and developing economies.====Our research contributes to two strands of existing literature. This first relates to differences between financial decisions of public and private firms (i.e., the counterparts of listed and unlisted firms in our context). For example, Asker et al. (2015) find that compared with private firms, public firms invest less and are less sensitive to changes in investment opportunities. Orihara (2014) confirms the same qualitative results of Asker et al. (2015) in Japanese counterparts. Focusing in UK private companies, Brav (2009) finds that private firms rely on debt financing extensively, and thereby have higher leverage ratios and avoid external financing. Bigelli and Sánchez-Vidal (2012) investigate cash holdings of Italian private firms. They find higher cash holdings for smaller private firms that are characterized as being younger, riskier and financially constrained. While our sample of unlisted firms is not exactly analogous to purely private firms in the literature mentioned above, they do share the characteristics of not being listed on a public exchange and the absence of a market price of equity. These overlapping features motivate the comparison of our results with those on investment behavior between public and private firms. However, given our sample, we can more precisely isolate the impact of listing on investment controlling for governance differences.====The current paper is also related to the literature on the impact of market pressure on investment. Public firms have more access to public capital markets than private firms. However, short-term market pressures, such as quarterly earnings announcements exert pressure on management, which may distort investment. Many authors argue, that too much focus on quarterly earnings or stock price by public firms distort investment decisions and cause firms to forego positive value creating investments.==== These pressures cause public firms to invest less than comparable private firms which are not subject to market pressure. However, using a sample of firms from the natural gas industry, Gilje and Taillard (2016) show that access to external capital is most relevant for explaining differences in investment between public and private firms. In a study focusing on Japan, Ikeda et al. (2018) find evidence that managers of public firms avoid making difficult investment decisions when they are protected from the disciplinary effects of capital markets, which may also lead listed firms to underinvest.====Empirical evidence in Orihara (2017) suggests the nature of firm is important for understanding the liquidity market monitoring (scrutiny) tradeoff of listing on corporate investment policies in Japan. Furthermore, using private firms as a control group for the treatment group of listed firms, Ueda et al. (2019) show that listing mitigates financial constraints.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant institutional background, in Section 3 our hypotheses are developed, Section 4 describes our sample and presents our empirical methods, Section 5 discusses the empirical results, and Section 6 provides a summary of observations and directions for further research.",Does stock market listing impact investment in Japan?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158320300307,15 July 2020,2020,Research Article,66.0

In countries such as the U.S., China, and Germany, there is widespread fear that the adoption of robots will lead to technological unemployment, as humans are replaced by machines. “Let us remember that the automatic machine is the precise economic equivalent of slave labor. Any labor which competes with slave labor must accept the economic consequences of slave labor (Norbert Weiner).”====Japan, however, remains an exception. There is no public outcry about robots taking over jobs. In Japan, public opinion is that robots are less of a threat to jobs and more about economic survival, as the nation suffers from a chronic labor shortage. It is striving to become the nation substituting the greatest number of jobs with robots. In 2014, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled reforms with hopes that the Japanese robot market would reach $21 billion by 2020.====In this paper, we show that this sanguine view about robots and jobs is justified. We show that robots have expanded aggregate employment in Japan. Among all countries, Japan has the longest history stretching back into the 1970s in the widespread adoption of industrial robots (Lynn, 1983). Japan in 2012 had about 10 and 5 times as many robots per worker than in the U.S. and in Europe. It would appear that Japan would be the ideal laboratory to study the impact of robots on labor demand. If robots have actually raised overall employment in Japan, a country far more advanced in the use of robots than other industrialized countries, then labor in other countries should also be more sanguine about our future with robots.====This paper makes three contributions. First, robots can be quantified in two ways: by the sheer number of robots or by the value of robots, which is the number of robots weighted by their real price. The previous literature used only the number of robots measure. While useful, this measure is flawed in that it ignores the differences in robot quality across industries. Take two industries, electronics and textiles. Both may employ 1000 robots, but the quality (price) of robots in electronics may be higher, resulting in more displacement of labor, but higher productivity growth in electronics.====Second, earlier studies used data from the International Federation of Robots IFR, 2020), which contain data only from 1996 to today. Our data from the Japan Robotics Association contain data from the late 1970s until today, allowing us to examine the impact of robots on employment over a long span of time not possible in other economies. We would expect that the effects of robots will unfold over decades rather than over a 10 year span examined in earlier studies.====Third, while we adopt the equilibrium approach of Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017), we focus on industries as our unit of analysis, rather than commuting zones. Focussing on commuting zones makes aggregation to the national level difficult, since in general the assumption of no trade or labor migration across commuting zones must be maintained. In this paper, we allow for labor migration across industries and regions, and the free movement of goods within the country (but not internationally).====Our industry level analysis makes aggregating the effects to the national level simpler and more general, and allows us to separate the equilibrium aggregate impact of robots on labor demand into three distinct effects: the negative “displacement” effect, which is the substitution of robots into labor at the industry level; the positive “productivity” effect, which is the increased demand for labor in that industry, owing to the decline in costs. The cost decline in the industry shifts labor demand to that industry. The third positive “general equilibrium” effect arises when as productivity increases and the industry expands, other industries expand, raising aggregate demand.====We find that overall, the displacement effect is negative, but the productivity and aggregate effects are positive, leading to an increase in demand for labor for the average Japanese industry.====An important policy concern is how robots may differentially affect disadvantaged groups such as females, high school graduates, and part-time workers, compared to the general population. We find that robots have tended to raise demand for the most vulnerable workers. For example, while relative to university graduates, the negative displacement effect of high school graduates is higher, we find that the employment of high school graduates has increased overall with the introduction of robots.====Despite the widespread popular interest on the impact of robots on labor, the literature is relatively sparse. In a seminal paper, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) regressed robot densitites and labor across 722 U.S. commuting zones and found a robust negative relationship between robots and labor. Adachi et al. (2019) and Dauth et al. (2019) mimic the Acemoglu and Restrepo methodology for 105 Japanese and 402 German commuting zones, respectively, and find small or insignificant effects of robots on labor demand in the commuting zones. These results using commuting zone data do not adjust for trade and migration among commuting zones within a country.====Graetz and Michaels (2018) combine robotics data on 14 industries across European countries from the IFR and find a positive relationship between robots and labor. ADB (2018) finds in their cross-country analysis that robots decrease employment in routine jobs and increase employment in non-routine jobs. Fujiwara and Zhu (2019) show using the same IFR data that while robots increase aggregate productivity, the effect of robots on employment is ambiguous.====Recently, Japan has been collecting firm level survey data on robot use. Destefano et al. (2019) take Japanese firm level data on the use of robots and find that increased robot adoption has resulted in greater layoffs of workers. Morikawa (2020) is concerned with the determinants of the installation of robots in Japan, such as the aging of the population, not on the impact of robots on employment per se.",Robots and industrial labor: Evidence from Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158320300459,6 October 2020,2020,Research Article,71.0

First, we provide the best proxy for monthly interventions for the period from 1971 to 1990, when the intervention timings and amounts were not officially disclosed. The accuracy of the proxy is tested for the period when the statistics were disclosed after 1991. The proxy explains 99.8% of actual settlement-based interventions. Second, we examine conditions under which the Japanese monetary authorities are likely to intervene by estimating a policy reaction function, using the long-term data, spanning the period when intervention data have been officially disclosed and the period where our proxy is available. Third, we analyze intervention timings and amounts for Japan, the US, and Germany. Fourth, we present the episode of international coordination represented by the Plaza and Louvre agreements as a case study of notable interventions during the period.","Japan is known to have resisted rapid yen appreciation by occasionally conducting foreign exchange interventions since it departed from the Bretton Woods system in August 1971. The frequency and scale of interventions have been relatively large for a developed country, and Japan has been a popular country for studies in the intervention literature. The daily data of interventions for the period since April 1, 1991 have been officially made available to the public. However, intervention data before March 1991 have not been officially disclosed. Some researchers have relied on newspaper reports based on leaks and market rumors in order to analyze particular episodes. Others have used either changes in foreign reserves or the data titled “Treasury Funds and Others/Foreign Exchange” released by the Bank of Japan as a proxy for intervention. However, changes in foreign reserves, for example, include receipts of interest income on the foreign reserves, which are not interventions.====Ito and Yabu (2017) identified an accurate proxy for the monthly intervention amount for the period for which official data have not been disclosed. The accuracy of different possible proxies was tested against “transaction-based” interventions which took place during the period from which data are available. The best proxy, identified by Ito and Yabu, is more accurate than other popular proxies used in the existing literature, which include change in foreign reserves and the Bank of Japan's ""Treasury Funds and Others/Foreign Exchange.""====In this paper, we first show that, in testing for the best proxy, it is important to distinguish “transaction-based” intervention from “settlement-based” interventions. Due to the market practice in the foreign exchange market, settlement is done two business days later than transactions—a rule known as ====. We find that Ito and Yabu's (2017) best proxy captures the movements of settlement-based interventions very well, explaining 99.8% of settlement-based interventions. Our first contribution is that we provide reliable data for intervention, from August 1971—the end of the Bretton Woods system—to March 1991. From April 1991, the official data for intervention are available.====Second, we analyze the conditions under which interventions are most likely to occur for the period from August 1971 to March 2018. The officially disclosed data are used for April 1991 to March 2018 and our proxy is used from August 1971 to March 1991. Since reaction functions, which represent the monetary authorities’ tolerance of and resistance to exchange rate volatility, are expected to have evolved and transformed over the 47 years under consideration, possible structural breaks in reaction functions will be carefully examined in this paper.====Third, the US and German monetary authorities have disclosed daily intervention data for the period beginning in 1973 and 1976, respectively. By analyzing intervention timings and amounts in the three countries, insights can be obtained on policy coordination or lack thereof, among the G3, in the past four decades.====Fourth, we present the episode of international coordination represented by the Plaza and Louvre agreements as a case study of notable interventions during the period under consideration.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will review the foreign exchange intervention literature. Section 3 will review Ito and Yabu (2017) and show that in testing for the best proxy, it is important to distinguish transaction-based intervention from settlement-based intervention. Section 4 will provide an overview of the yen/dollar rates and interventions over the past 47 years. Section 5 will analyze the conditions under which the Japanese monetary authorities are likely to intervene in the foreign exchange market.

It provides a nuanced picture of financial interconnectedness that has not been available in the literature to date.Our measure, FIRank, shows the probability of connection to the network by any country or, equivalently, the share of all connections captured by each country, and provides relative rankings of countries according to their degree of interconnectedness. We show that the United Kingdom and the United States remain the ‘core’ in the global banking network over a thirty-three-year period, with most countries scattered in the ‘periphery’ despite considerable growth and change in the network.This finding contrasts with claims of an increasingly even distribution of connections reported in other studies using more limited network measures. Examining whether financial interconnectedness raises or lowers output volatility, we show that the relationship is nonlinear: initially, higher interconnectedness raises volatility, but beyond a critical level volatility is reduced. This is true in periods of smaller and idiosyncratic shocks but is even more pronounced in the GFC period of large shocks. The novelty of our approach lies in applying well-understood network measures to cross-border banking data to identify where countries rank in international financial interconnectedness with the global bank-lending network.Further, by explicitly analysing how the relative interconnectedness index is related to output volatility we provide new insights into the pros and cons of higher levels of international financial interconnection.","The network approach has been employed in disciplines ranging from computer science and social network theory to ecology and epidemiology, but only recently in economics and finance.====The literature on financial networks can be roughly divided into two strands. The first strand was pioneered by a group of modellers who used simulation techniques to model shock transmission in a financial network (Allen and Gale, 2000; Gai et al., 2011; Blasques, Brauning and van Lelyveld, 2015; Elliott, Golub and Jackson, 2014). These studies share a focus on identifying particular network structures that are prone to shock transmission and amplification in the network.====A second strand of literature harnessing the richness of network methods explores key facts about networks that emerge from actual data. Two distinctive approaches are observed. The first approach often uses graphs of financial networks to visualize increased financial interconnectedness and how an individual country is connected to other countries in the network. Often a set of standard network statistics (e.g. in-degree, out-degree, closeness, and clustering; further described below) are calculated to identify financial/banking centres (von Peter, 2007), financial clusters where countries form more of a closed system (IMF 2010 and 2011; Garratt et al., 2011), and the structure of financial networks (Bech and Atalay, 2010; Kubelec and Sa, 2012; Minoiu and Reyes, 2011; Ogawa et al, 2013).====The second approach in this empirical strand of literature applies network methods to generate measures of connectedness and systemic risks for financial institutions. Financial interconnectedness is assumed to be related to financial stability, and systemic risks have emerged to be a key stability concern after the 2007-8 Global Financial Crisis (Haldane, 2009; Yellen, 2013). Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) identify a suite of network metrics that can be readily used to measure connectedness of financial firms and show they are intimately related to systemic risk measures commonly used in the finance literature. Following this line of research, Dungey, Luciani and Veredas (2014) measure systemic risks via interconnectedness of banking, insurance and real economy firms in the United States for 500 firms. Their systemic risk index, SIFIRank, is derived using a network algorithm, the PageRank algorithm, from an undirected, weighted network of risk-interconnected financial and real firms where the links in the network are stock volatilities and correlations of volatilities provide weights. Their results show banking firms are consistently systemically risky in the economy and insurance firms also display substantial systemic risks. Similarly, the DebtRank measure developed by Battiston et al. (2012a) and Battiston et al. (2012b) is designed to measure systemic importance of individual financial institutions employing data on US FED's external claims for a short period during the GFC (it has been applied to other markets and data but always at the individual institutional level).====Our paper applies the PageRank algorithm to the global banking network to create a measure of “financial interconnectedness” among countries, FIRank. There are two important differences in our approach from the above studies. First, our measure of interconnectedness is at the country level, obtained from a network of financially connected countries, while Diebold and Yilmaz (2014), Battiston, et al. (2012b) and Dungey, Luciani and Veredas (2014) use firm-level measures. Second, the directed network in our study is linked by aggregates of banks’ foreign claims from one country on another (i.e. banks loans and other claims to or from a country) for the links, rather than using price data (stock price volatilities are used by Dungey et al.) as in these firm-level network studies.====Our study shares some features with both the country-level networks studies and the institution level ones but the aim of the paper is to establish a richer measure of country-level financial interconnectedness and to bring the insights from studies of networks between financial institutions to bear on the understanding of a network between countries. Our descriptive results show that the United Kingdom and the United States remain the ‘core’ in the global banking network over a thirty three year period including the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), with most other countries scattered in the ‘periphery’, despite considerable growth and change in the network. Further, our new measure reveals that the network remained skewed even after the GFC, with a bunched core of countries at the centre and a long tail of less connected countries in the periphery, in contrast to an apparent evening-out of connections reported in studies using more limited network measures.====We then apply the index of financial interconnectedness (which captures the probability of being connected) to an empirical analysis of the relationship between financial interconnectedness and output volatility. This reveals complex nonlinear relationships between financial interconnectedness and output volatility. The results support a view that as countries rise in the ranks from low levels of financial interconnectedness, their output volatility initially increases but by diminishing amounts up to a critical level. Beyond the critical level output volatility begins to decrease with more interconnectedness; that is, the relationship is nonlinear. This is true in both normal times and in the pre-GFC period where smaller and idiosyncratic shocks are observed. The effect is even more pronounced in a setting of large shocks (such as the GFC) where financial interconnectedness has a significantly larger effect on volatility up to its turning point and then has a significantly larger smoothing effect on volatility compared with the normal period.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some stylised facts about the global banking network using standard network measures on our data. These suggest a degree of consensus about the nature of the global banking network. Section 3 introduces the PageRank-based financial interconnectedness index, FIRank, and Section 4 describes our data. Section 5 revisits the stylised facts, using FIRank in place of the standard network measures, and challenges the view that the network is becoming less concentrated (i.e. less skewed). Section 6 presents empirical findings on the relationship between interconnectedness and output volatility.

Our main results can be summarized as follows. First, in many instances, factor models and machine learning perform better than the conventional ====. Second, predictions made by machine learning methods perform particularly well for medium to long forecast horizons. Third, the success of machine learning mainly comes from the nonlinearity and interaction of variables, which suggests the importance of nonlinear structure in predicting the Japanese macroeconomic series. Fourth, the composite forecast of factor models and machine learning performs better than factor models or machine learning alone; and machine learning methods applied to common factors are found to be useful in the composite forecast.","The big data environment and machine learning methods have recently attracted a great deal of attention in economic analysis. When it comes to macroeconomic forecasting, Stock, Watson, 1999, Stock, Watson, 2002, Stock, Watson, 2012 have recommended using common factors, which are extracted from a large number of variables, as predictor variables and their dynamic factor approach has been widely used among macroeconomists. In an application of this methodology to the Japanese economy, Shintani (2005) evaluated the performance of dynamic factor models combined with neural networks by using a balanced panel of 235 monthly series from 1973 to 2000, and claimed the importance of considering the nonlinearity to improve the forecast accuracy. However, machine learning methods other than neural networks were not considered by Shintani (2005). In addition, since the sample period ended in 2000, the possibility of structural changes, such as the one caused by the global financial crisis in 2007-2009, could not be incorporated.====In this paper, we extend the analysis of Shintani (2005) and perform a thorough comparative analysis of factor models and machine learning methods for forecasting the Japanese economy by using updated macroeconomic data. In particular, we compare the forecast accuracy of factor models and various types of machine learning methods for 7 target variables by using 219 monthly series from 1973 to 2018. Other than in the use of the extended series, our forecast design differs from that of Shintani (2005), in the following three points. First, we employ not only neural networks but also other representative machine learning methods such as the regularized least squares methods, which include lasso, ridge, and elastic net, as well as the ensemble learning based on regression trees, which includes bagging, random forests, and boosting. Second, while a single hidden layer feedforward neural network was employed in Shintani (2005), we consider more general and improved neural networks, including a deeper neural network with multiple hidden layers, a convolutional neural network, and a recurrent neural network. Third, we examine the possibility of forecast improvement from composite forecasts to seek for the best combination of the two cases: the case in which the common factors are extracted by principal component analysis and the case in which machine learning methods are employed.====Our main results can be summarized as follows. First, in most cases, factor models and machine learning methods perform better than the conventional AR model. Second, machine learning methods work particularly well for relatively longer forecast horizons. Third, the success of machine learning methods mainly comes from the nonlinearity and interaction of variables, which suggests the importance of nonlinear structure in predicting the Japanese macroeconomic series. Fourth, composite forecasts of factor models and machine learning perform better than factor models or machine learning alone; and machine learning methods applied to common factors are found to be useful in the composite forecast.====There are many related studies on macroeconomic forecasting based on factor models and machine learning. Under the many predictors environment, a dynamic factor approach based on the principal components regression proposed by Stock, Watson, 1999, Stock, Watson, 2002, Stock, Watson, 2012 has been used in many applications, including those of Bai, Ng, 2002, Bai, Ng, 2006, Artis et al. (2005); Boivin and Ng (2006); Kim, Swanson, 2014, Kim, Swanson, 2018, to name a few. Kitamura and Koike (2003) and Shintani (2005) have applied this principal components regression forecast to the Japanese economy. There are also an increasing number of studies that employ machine learning methods in more recent macroeconomic forecasting applications. For example, Inoue and Kilian (2008) have considered lasso and ridge regression and compared their performance with bagging for the U.S. inflation forecast. Diebold and Shin (2019) employed lasso, ridge and their extensions for Euro area GDP forecast. Giannone et al. (2018) have applied a Bayesian forecasting framework that covered lasso, ridge and elastic net to Stock and Watson type macroeconomic data, among other series, for the purpose of evaluating the usefulness of sparse modeling. Nakajima and Sueishi (2020) have employed a lasso-VAR model for forecasting Japanese macroeconomic series. The usefulness of the ensemble machine learning based on regression trees, such as random forests, was emphasized in Medeiros et al. (2019) and Chen et al. (2019). Bai and Ng (2009) have examined the effectiveness of boosting in forecasting inflation, interest rate, industrial production, employment and the unemployment rate by using a large set of U.S. macroeconomic data. Those who undertook the macroeconomic forecasting application of neural networks include Nakamura (2005) for the U.S. inflation series, Shintani (2005) for the Japanese macroeconomic series, and Cook and Hall (2017) for the U.S. unemployment series, among others.====We are not interested in investigating the performance of a single method or single target series. Instead, we compare factor models and 9 different machine learning methods in forecasting 7 target macroeconomics variables at horizons from 1 month to 3 years. The research design of our analysis is closely related to that of Kim and Swanson (2018) and Coulombe et al. (2019), who conducted a horse race analysis using various machine learning methods in forecasting the U.S. macroeconomic variables. However, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to conduct a comprehensive forecast comparison of machine learning methods using Japanese macroeconomic data.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the factor models and machine learning methods that will be considered in this paper. In Section 3, we describe the overviews of our data and explain how we evaluate the performance of competing forecast models.

In the theoretical part, we investigate the model of a metropolitan area with heterogeneous regions.

In contrast, if the rent is sensitive to population growth, the population grows more in suburban regions. In the empirical part, we test the implications of the model using municipality-level panel data for the Tokyo metropolitan area. We find that the population elasticity of land price was greater than two before the mid-1990s, but was less than two thereafter. We also find that in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the population grew more in suburban regions until the mid-1990s, but grew more in central regions thereafter. These empirical findings are consistent with our theoretical predictions. We confirm that the results are robust even when we change the subsample periods. We also show that essentially the same results hold even when implementing the same experiment for the Osaka metropolitan area, the second largest metropolitan area in Japan.","Agglomeration economies are the benefits that come when people locate near one another in cities and industrial clusters. These benefits all ultimately come from transport cost savings, although the costs must be interpreted broadly, including the difficulties in exchanging goods, people, and ideas. If a particular location is prospering, then people should be willing to pay more for access to that location, and more people should move to that area. However, agglomerations should become less important as land prices rise in the area. The logic is that since people can move freely within a nation, they must be indifferent between different locales. This indifference implies that high amenities must be offset by high land prices. It is therefore not clear whether agglomerations still benefit people in a highly populated metropolitan area where land prices become very high.====This study examines the connection between land prices and agglomeration in the Tokyo metropolitan area. We investigate whether the population in this area has grown more in central or suburban regions as the economy grew over the past decades. The Tokyo metropolitan area is comprised of Tokyo Metropolis (the Metropolitan Prefecture) and its neighboring prefectures. It is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with approximately 36 million people recorded in the 2015 Population Census. Furthermore, Tokyo's urban spatial structure resembles a monocentric city, although there are several sub-centers. The center of the metropolitan area is downtown Tokyo (consisting of the three central wards of Chiyoda, Minato, and Chuo), with a densely concentrated population and business districts. The enormous concentration of business activities in downtown Tokyo has advantages. However, land prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area rose dramatically in the latter half of the 1980s and crashed in the 1990s. Therefore, it is worth exploring how agglomeration has evolved in this area and to examine whether the population has grown more in central or suburban regions over the past decades.====In the theoretical part of this study, we investigate the model of a metropolitan area with heterogeneous regions. The model is an extension of those in Epple et al. (1984) and Kanemoto (1980).==== We demonstrate that which regions will have larger population growth when the economy grows is ambiguous. We find that if the rent is not sensitive to population growth, the population grows more in central regions when the economy grows. In contrast, if the rent is sensitive to population growth, the population grows more in suburban regions when the economy grows. In the empirical part of our study, we test the implications of the model using municipality-level panel data for the Tokyo metropolitan area. The sample period was from 1981 to 2018. We split the sample period before and after the mid-1990s. The first subsample is the period when land prices grew dramatically and crashed in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The second subsample is the period when land prices remained stable in the area. We find that the population elasticity of land price was greater than two before the mid-1990s, but less than two thereafter. We also find that the population grew more in suburban regions until the mid-1990s, but grew more in central regions thereafter. These empirical findings are consistent with our theoretical predictions. We confirm that the results are robust even when we change the subsample periods. We also demonstrate that essentially the same results hold even when implementing the same experiment for the Osaka metropolitan area, the second largest metropolitan area in Japan.====In the literature, a number of studies have explored agglomeration in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Hatta and Okawara (1993, 1994) showed that Tokyo has a larger population size and higher residential land price due to lower commuting costs per kilometer. Merriman et al. (1994) showed that compensation for commutes takes the form of both lower housing prices and higher wages in the Tokyo metropolitan area.==== Kanemoto et al. (2006) applied the Henry George Theorem to test whether the Tokyo metropolitan area is too large. Kawabata and Abe (2018) investigated how intra-metropolitan spatial patterns of female labor force participation relate to commute times in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Using rental housing data for Tokyo, Sadayuki (2018) empirically examined how the clustering of train and subway stations influences rental prices in their vicinity. However, none of these studies explored the structural change of agglomeration economies in the Tokyo metropolitan area over the past decades. Over the past decades, the population stopped growing and started declining in many regions in Japan.==== After the bubble crash in the early 1990s, land prices also started declining in most regions in Japan. The main contribution of the current study is that the Tokyo metropolitan area experienced a structural change from deglomeration to agglomeration when the population elasticity of land price declined significantly in the mid-1990s.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 constructs our basic model and discusses it implications. Section 3 estimates the population elasticity of land price and Section 4 explores agglomeration and deglomeration in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Section 5 investigates robustness of our estimation results using rolling regressions.

The analysis shows that, for both Japan and Korea, aging has positive effects on labor productivity when older workers are working in industries with a large share of information and communication technology (ICT) in the capital stock. We also find that, on average, older workers exert positive effects on labor productivity across all industries when they are low-educated in Japan and high-educated in Korea. In addition, a complementary effect between ICT capital and older workers is observed for both high- and low-educated workers in Japan but only for low-educated workers in Korea. The complementarity between ICT and old workers existed in both manufacturing and services industries of Korea and Japan.","Population aging, a consequence of increasing life expectancies and declining fertility rates, stands out as a significant challenge to many advanced and developing economies. Older workers are thought to be less productive and innovative than their younger counterparts due to the deterioration of physical and cognitive abilities with age. There are concerns among aging societies that an increase in the share of elderly and the aging workforce will hinder economic growth.====Japan is one of the world's most aged societies and has a rapidly aging population and shrinking labor force. The elderly aged over 65 years account for 28.0% of Japan's population in 2019, and this number is forecasted to increase to 30.9% by 2040 (Fig. 1). Aging is also in progress within Japan's workforce. Fig. 2 presents those aged 50–64 (defined as “older workers” or “old” in this text) as a share of the working-age population aged 15 to 64 years. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the share of older workers will increase from 31.6% in 2019 to 36.8% by 2040 in Japan. Population aging is an urgent issue. The Japanese government has made several attempts to tackle Japan's low fertility rates and shrinking labor force, such as by improving workplace conditions for married couples and elderly people.====South Korea (“Korea” hereafter) is no exception to this global population aging trend. Following the path of Japan, it is one of the global economies that is experiencing a rapid demographic shift toward an aged society. By 2040, the elderly aged over 65 years will account for 33% of Korea's population, more than doubling from 15% in 2019 (Fig. 1). Korea's working-age population aged 15–64 years will shrink by more than a quarter between 2019 and 2040. As in Japan, the shrinking labor force will have a significantly negative effect on the growth of the Korean economy, which is already losing economic vitality. More seriously, the pace of workforce aging is faster in Korea than in any other economy, as shown in Fig. 2. The share of older workers has been rising rapidly since the 1990s, more than doubling from 16% in 1990 to 33% in 2019. It is expected to continue to rise until 2050, outpacing Japan and Germany.====Over the coming decades, an increase in the share of older workers may hinder human capital growth and technological progress in Japan and Korea if old workers are less productive than young workers. However, if they are better-educated, continuously develop their human capital after their formal education by adapting to new technologies, and have longer work experience, their productivity might not be lower than that of younger workers.====Japan and Korea are the two Asian economies that have invested heavily in new technologies, as measured by the number of patents and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) (Chomik and Piggott, 2019). As also documented in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2019, Japan and Korea maintained relatively higher ICT investment share over the past two decades, but lower than the U.S. did.====As of 2015, the ICT sector accounted for about 10.4% of total value-added in the Korean economy due to strong ICT manufacturing (OECD, 2017), ranking first among OECD economies (Fig. 3). Japan's ICT sector is smaller than Korea's, accounting for 6.0% of the total value-added of the Japanese economy. The Korean ICT sector has grown rapidly and has become a major industry.====Against this backdrop, investigating the Japanese and Korean experience of aging populations and adaptation to technology-dependent environments will provide useful insights and policy implications for other economies encountering the same demographic challenge. This study empirically examines whether aging has had detrimental effects on labor productivity in Japan and Korea, and further examines how aging interacts with new technologies in the workplace. This study focuses on the role of ICT investment in improving elderly workers’ productivity, by using industry-level data.====Many empirical studies investigate the relationship between productivity and (population) aging using both micro- and macro-level data. Some empirical studies show that workers’ productivity declines with age due to a deterioration of physical and cognitive capacities (Truxillo et al., 2015). However, other studies show that aging is not necessarily accompanied by productivity decline, possibly due to the offsetting effects of human capital investment and technologies. For instance, using data drawn from a truck assembly plant in Germany, Borsch-Supan and Weiss (2016) report a constant increase in productivity among individuals up to the age 60, on average. Burtless (2013) also argues that there is little evidence for the negative link between aging and productivity in the US. Finally, firm-level studies conducted in many countries suggest that productivity tends to peak around age 30 to 45 but that this range varies across countries and industries, as summarized in Chomik and Piggott (2019). Some firms also exhibit relatively long peak-age periods while others have very short ones. The variation in the duration of productivity peak ages suggests that workers in some sectors may exhibit higher productivity even at later stages in their careers (ADB, 2018).====Empirical studies based on aggregate economy-level data show that aging, especially in advanced economies, has negative effects on the economy's output growth. Maestas et al. (2016) reports that, in the US, a 10% increase in the elderly (aged 60 and above) share in total population reduced GDP per capita growth rates by 5.5% between 1998 and 2010. One-third of this decline can be explained by the shrinking workforce and the remaining two-thirds by the slower growth rate of labor productivity. Other studies, including Tang and MacLeod (2006) and Gordon (2017), also report that a higher share of older workers in the workforce lowers productivity, thereby hindering growth. Using data on EU 28 countries from 1950 to 2014, Aiyar and Ebeke (2016) show that an aging workforce has a negative effect on labor productivity and total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Wasiluk (2014) considers a model in which firms with a higher share of older workers update their technology less often and are more reluctant to train them for new technologies and estimates a 0.17-percentage-point decrease in the annual productivity growth rate for Germany between 2010 and 201, due to the aging of the workforce. By contrast, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) report a significant positive link between aging and GDP per capita. They argue that population aging may have a positive effect on productivity growth, as a shortage of young and prime-age workers can facilitate the adoption of automation technologies, thereby resulting in a higher growth in output per capita.====The literature has also examined the impact of ICT capital stock on labor productivity and total factor productivity (TFP). Positive effects of ICT capital on TFP have been reported in Jorgenson et al. (2003) and O'Mahony et al. (2010). Basu et al. (2003) find that the TFP growth in the late 1990s was positively associated with the growth of ICT capital services in the US. They suggest that ICT capital reflects an unobserved accumulation of intangible organizational capital, spillovers of a general-purpose technology, or both.====Studies using firm-level microdata provide evidence for the link between firm-level ICT adoption and productivity growth (Bresnahan et al., 2002; Brynjolfsson et al., 2002; Pilat, 2005). Some studies suggest limited effect of ICT investment on productivity and point to factors determining the effects of ICT. Bresnahan et al. (2002) argue that investments in training and organization change must be made in order to obtain the relative productivity benefits of ICT adoption.====A number of studies have explored the impact of ICT capital on labor productivity in Japan and Korea using the growth accounting techniques based on industry-level data, especially those from the EU KLEMS (Timmer et al., 2007) and WORLD KLEMS (Jorgenson, 2012). Fukao et al. (2009) find that productivity growth was strong in ICT-producing manufacturing sectors (such as electrical machinery and electronics) but relatively weak in ICT-using service sectors (such as retail, wholesale, and transportation) in both Japan and Korea from 1995 to 2005. They argue that excessive regulations and a lack of competition in service sectors may have prevented the enhancement of ICT-usage effects. Fukao (2013) also points out that, in Japan, ICT capital accumulation was very slow in non-ICT manufacturing and service industries, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises, contributing to declining TFP growth during the “two lost decades.” By contrast, Jung et al. (2013) and Hwang and Shin (2017) confirm the significant positive spillover effects of ICT investment on TFP growth across ICT-producing and ICT-using industries in Korea. Jung et al. (2013) argue that these positive spillovers were due to the construction of a quality nationwide network that allows connections across all households and industries. Using a multifactor general equilibrium model, Kim et al. (2019) find that ICT investment has greater positive effects on productivity in Korea than in Japan.====Despite the rapidly changing labor market and the significance of new technologies such as ICT and artificial intelligence (AI) in workplaces in Japan and Korea, few studies have analyzed the interplay of ICT and older workers in these two countries and its consequence on productivity. Using Japanese industry-level data, Kawaguchi and Muroga (2019) find no empirical evidence supporting that population aging encourages the adoption of robots or ICT and that technological progress has a mitigating effect on the decline in older workers’ productivity in Japan. Using Korean data, Park et al. (2019) also find no evidence that robots are more heavily adopted in the industries with aging workers. They find some evidence that adopting robot technology mitigates the negative effects of aging on TFP growth particularly in labor-intensive industries. Ilmakunnas and Miyakoshi (2013) use aggregate manufacturing data from 13 OECD countries, including Japan and Korea, to investigate the effect of aging and ICT capital on labor productivity from 1970 to 2005. Although their discussion on each economy is limited, they confirm that investment in ICT capital has positive effects on labor productivity for high-skilled older workers across the economies.====This study builds on that line of research and contributes to it by investigating the effects of ICT capital on the productivity of older workers in Japan and Korea using industry panel data. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the interactions between ICT capital and workers in different age groups using comparative industry-level data from Japan and Korea.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides our empirical specification. Section 3 describes the study's data. Section 4 examines how aging affects labor productivity in Japan and Korea using industry-level data. Section 5 discusses whether the effects differ according to the sector (manufacturing vs. services). Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.","Aging labor, ICT capital, and productivity in Japan and Korea",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158320300320,2 August 2020,2020,Research Article,76.0

We show that candidates tailor their stances toward ","Trade competition has intensified amid ongoing economic globalization. Emerging economies such as China greatly influence global trade. Many studies have been conducted on the impact of rising trade competition on local labor market outcomes. Autor et al==== (2013) found that increased exposure to Chinese import penetration has a negative impact on employment and wages in U.S. local labor markets, resulting in higher unemployment, lower labor-force participation, and rising transfer payments. Dauth et al==== (2014) observed a negative impact of increased imports from China and Eastern Europe on employment in the manufacturing industry in German local labor markets; however, an increase in exports to those countries had a more positive impact. Balsvik et al==== (2015) also showed that rising competition with Chinese imports negatively affected employment in the manufacturing industry in Norwegian local labor markets. Manufacturing jobs in Spanish and French local labor markets were also negatively influenced by surges in imports from China, as shown by Donoso et al. (2015) and Malgouyres (2017), respectively.====The findings of these studies imply that the expansion of trade that accompanies globalization inevitably creates losers, which, in fact, causes protectionist backlash. Feigenbaum and Hall (2015) showed that local exposure to increased imports from China induced U.S. representatives to vote for protectionist trade bills. Autor et al. (2017) found that surges in imports from China influenced the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election: Donald Trump, who advocated for “America First,” won the presidential race. Colantone and Sting (2018a) showed that regional exposure to increased imports from China caused voters to support nationalist and radical-right parties in Western European countries. Caselli et al. (2018) also found that local exposure to severe competition from Chinese imports and intense immigration contributed to the electoral success of far-right parties in Italy. Similarly, Colantone and Sting (2018b) showed that regional exposure to surges in imports from China drove voters to support Brexit in the U.K.====On the contrary, some studies have shown that the expanding world trade that accompanies globalization does not exert an adverse impact on Japanese local labor markets. Taniguchi (2019) found that the increased prevalence of imports from China, particularly intermediate goods, has a positive impact on employment in the manufacturing industry in Japanese prefectural labor markets. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (2017) also found that increased imports from, and exports to, the rest of the world positively affect employment in the manufacturing industry in Japanese prefectural labor markets.==== These findings suggest that Japanese manufacturing industries play a major role in manufacturing processes from an international point of view; thus, exports and imports of intermediate and final goods can have a positive impact on regional employment in the manufacturing sector.====These findings contrast with those of the abovementioned studies conducted in the U.S. and Europe. Thus, Japan is an interesting case regarding the effects of regional exposure to trade competition on Japanese trade politics, begging the question of whether there is any difference in the impact of local trade exposure on trade politics in Japan and Western countries. So far, minimal attention has been paid to this point. The aim of this paper is to illuminate how changes in regional exposure to imports and exports of manufacturing products affect both candidates and voters in Japanese national elections.====One of our goals is to examine how candidates, including incumbents, former Diet members, and new candidates, alter their stances on trade policy according to changes in regional import and export exposure. We believe that investigating this matter will lead to a better understanding of whether legislators alter their policies depending on changes in their constituencies’ preferences.==== Our empirical analysis reveals whether candidates are forced to adapt to local exposure to trade competition to attract voter support.====To this end, we focus on candidates running for seats in more than one national election and exploit the variations over time in their policies on international trade, thereby utilizing panel data analysis. In particular, using a fixed-effects regression model allows us to control for a candidate's time-invariant individual variables, which can be extremely difficult to observe and measure, such as his/her political ability, creed, and ideology.==== Moreover, we also adopt an instrumental variable (IV) approach to address the possible endogeneity of local trade exposure.====An exceptional paper has been written by Ito (2018), who examined the effects of import penetration from China on candidates’ trade policy preferences and showed that increased imports from China, particularly those of goods used in the production process, prevent candidates from supporting free trade and that the level of impact of Chinese imports depends on the degree of competitive pressure in elections. However, his paper does not include an observation of the changes in candidates’ policies over time using panel data, and its research interest differs from ours.====Another goal of this study is to examine how regional exposure to international competition affects voter behavior. Che et al. (2015) showed that regional exposure to tightening import competition from China increased the share of votes garnered by the Democrats, the probability that a Democrat would be elected, and voter turnout in the U.S. House of Representatives elections.==== Jensen et al==== (2017), analyzing the effects of international trade on U.S. presidential elections, showed that increasing imports (exports) lead to a decrease (increase) in incumbent-party vote shares at the national level.====Based on the foregoing context, we are concerned with how local trade exposure impacts voters’ support for parties endorsing efforts to liberalize trade and for those opposing such efforts. Voters’ feelings about their exposure to imports and exports may affect their level of support for parties; if they feel discontented with trade exposure, their discontentment may contribute to an increase in support for parties opposing liberalized trade. This paper is not focused on voter support for a specific party because parties often experience changes in their alignment and membership. Parties may split up and dissolve, and new parties may be formed. Many Diet members have defected from one party and joined another.==== The number of parties competing for votes was 12 in the 2009 Lower House election, 13 in the 2012 election, and 11 in the 2014 election. Among these, only 5 parties survived in the Diet: the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), New Komeito, the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The empirical analysis here also uses a fixed-effects model, which allows us to control for time-invariant unobservable district-level variables, and adopts an IV approach, which enables us to tackle endogeneity problems. Focusing on groups of parties sharing a view about trade policy rather than a party itself, we explore the direction in which voters’ preferences regarding trade policy were headed in response to local exposure to import penetration and export growth.====Our first empirical analysis shows that candidates adjust their stances toward trade policy to adapt them to changes in regional trade exposure. Particularly, when exports increase in an election district, its candidates tend to develop more favorable attitudes toward free trade. In contrast, candidates do not tend to take more protectionist stances even when their constituencies experience increased imports. From these results, we can observe that local economies benefit from growth in exports, whereas an increase in imports does not necessarily harm local economies.====Our second empirical analysis indicates that voters change their support for parties in response to changes in local import and export exposure. In districts with increased exports, parties that pledge to promote an FTA tend to receive broader support from voters, whereas parties that adopt cautious stances toward it tend to lose the support of voters. In districts experiencing increased imports, parties that clearly oppose it win wider support from voters.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 examines how changes in local trade exposure affect candidates’ positions on trade policy in elections. Section 3 investigates how changes in local trade exposure affect voter support for political parties in elections.

We differentiate firms’ imports according to the tariff regime used (e.g. regional trade agreements (RTAs)). Our finding is that imports under RTA regimes are not considerably associated with exports. Rather, greater exports are found in firms with larger imports under the ==== or other preference regimes (e.g. duty drawback for raw materials imported to produce export products). One reason for the result in RTA imports is that active RTA importers mainly target the domestic market rather than the export market. If the main market is abroad, firms tend to use other preference regimes. Thus, the other preference regimes may contribute more greatly to the development of firm-level back-and-forth international transactions than RTAs do.","Trade liberalisation contributes to developing international production networks and global value chains (GVCs). Since the 1990s, tariff rates have been lowered around the world by the Uruguay Round in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the proliferation of regional trade agreements (RTAs). The tariff rates of the generalised system of preferences (GSP), especially for the least developed countries, were also eliminated in the 2000s. During the same period, multinational enterprises have engaged in active back-and-forth international transactions and have formed international production and distribution networks all over the world. Observing these two phenomena in the same period, we tend to perceive the increase in RTAs as a major source of the development of international production networks. Indeed, several studies have recognised their positive effects (Antràs and Staiger, 2012; Blyde and Faggioni, 2017; Boffa et al., 2019; Osnago et al., 2017; Ruta, 2017).====The rise in imports through trade liberalisation is expected to increase exports through various channels. First, previous studies have found a complementary relationship in start-up costs for exporting and importing. For example, as mentioned in Aristei et al. (2013), common sunk costs arise when firms establish an organisational structure in charge of international operations or when firms acquire information on foreign markets, which may include both potential buyers (export) and suppliers of intermediate inputs (import). Therefore, the start-up costs for exporting decrease for importers. Second, importing may enhance the competitiveness of export products. For example, firms’ productivity may rise due to learning from importing, which lowers production costs (Amiti and Konings, 2007; Bustos, 2011; Kasahara and Rodrigue, 2008). In addition, as found in Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2015); Fan et al. (2015); and Hayakawa et al. (2017), importing high-quality inputs will raise the quality of export products through the quality complementary between imports and exports (Antoniades, 2015).====In this paper, we study the association between imports and exports at a firm level by employing Thai customs data. Thailand is a major manufacturing base in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is home to the largest number of Japanese multinationals amongst ASEAN countries. As a member of ASEAN, Thailand has concluded RTAs with neighbouring countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, Thailand has been both a production and export base in ASEAN. To investigate the firm-level nexus between exports and imports, we employ firm-level trade data from Thai customs for 2007–2014. The import data enable us to identify tariff regimes claimed by importing firms in customs clearance. By using these data, we examine how firms’ imports under each tariff regime (e.g. most favoured nation (MFN) or RTAs) change their exports. Such differentiation of imports according to tariff regimes – which has never been done in the literature – enables us to directly examine the export–import nexus in RTA users.====Two competing forces are at work in the association between exports and imports according to tariff regimes. The first is analogous to the recent study on the impact of imports on exports, i.e. imports under RTA regimes may have a positive association with exports, as discussed above. For example, Feng et al. (2016) empirically investigated the firm-level impacts of imports on exports by employing Chinese customs data. They found significantly positive impacts on not only the export value but also the export scope (i.e. the number of export products). To further investigate this nexus between exports and imports, we differentiate imports according to tariff regimes. For example, even when importing the same product, firms can import that product under RTA regimes more cheaply than under the MFN regime. Thus, the association between imports and exports would be higher in firms that have larger imports under RTA regimes.====The second force is based on the sales strategy. When importing, there are two kinds of preference regimes. One is the RTA regime while the other includes other preference regimes such as duty-drawback regimes or free economic zone regimes.==== Unlike RTA regimes, the latter regimes do not require imported products to comply with rules of origin. Thus, the utilisation costs of the latter regimes are lower than those of RTA regimes. However, the latter regimes basically require importers to sell their products to the export market. Therefore, export-seeking firms and domestic market-seeking firms, respectively, may tend to choose the other preference regimes and RTA regimes in importing. As a result, RTA importers may tend to sell their products mainly for the domestic market and thus have less exports.====We assess which force is more prevalent by examining the association of each type of imports with exports. Feng et al. (2016) investigated the causal impacts of imports on exports by employing the instrument variable (IV) method. However, we do not identify the cause and consequence in our empirical analysis because our model has multiple import variables according to tariff regimes, unlike Feng et al. (2016). Since we examine three types of imports – under MFN, RTAs, and other preference regimes – it would be difficult to find (at least) three instruments for these three import variables. Therefore, we focus on the net effects of imports on exports. Nevertheless, our results by tariff regime are invaluable. Our main finding is that the association between RTA imports and exports is low because RTA importers tend to sell to the domestic market. Larger exports are found in firms with larger imports under MFN and other preference regimes.====Our results do not necessarily contradict those of some previous studies. As mentioned above, several studies have found positive effects of RTAs on GVCs. However, such studies have shed light on the role of ‘deep’ trade agreements, e.g. agreements with provisions on non-tariff advanced issues such as investment, intellectual property rights, or dispute settlement. In contrast, this paper focuses on the traditional role of trade agreements, i.e. tariff reduction, and does not investigate the role of such advanced issues. Then, we show that a tariff advantage in RTAs does not necessarily enhance the GVCs compared with other available preference regimes.====The rest of this paper is organised as follows.

The literature has traditionally highlighted the influence of US monetary policy on driving cross-border bank flows, and more recently the importance of both US and Euro Area (EA) financial/banking sectors’ related variables. Our contribution is the simultaneous analysis of the role of these US and EA drivers, as well as their interactions with real sector shocks. We corroborate the negative impact of US monetary policy tightening on cross-border lending to EMs, but we find that EA monetary policy seems to have an impact mostly on Emerging Europe, reflecting the fact that cross-border lending to most other EM regions is dollar denominated. We also find that real sector shocks in both the US and EA trigger an increase in cross-border lending, but less in EA when modeling the financial sector. Finally, for financial sector shocks, such as those associated with a decrease in bank leverage, our results indicate a broad-based overall contraction of cross-border lending if the shock originates in the US, and heterogenous effects across borrowing regions if the shock originates in the EA.","The literature (e.g., ====, ====) has traditionally seen monetary conditions in the United States (US) as playing a key role in the evolution of cross-border credit to EMs. More recently, ==== and ====, ====) relate the evolution of cross-border bank lending to investors’ uncertainty and risk aversion, as captured by the US VIX, and ==== relate it to US banks’ risk attitudes and funding conditions as proxied by the leverage of US broker-dealers. In addition, ====The aim of this paper is to simultaneously explore, US and Euro Area (EA) drivers of cross-border lending, while controlling for lender and borrower changes in economic activity. This is important not only because US and EA monetary responses are a function of domestic cyclical conditions, but also because US and EA financial/banking conditions are not independent in a globalized economy. For example, it is likely that US ==== affects both US and EA banks’ conditions given the importance of dollar funding for international banks. In addition, financial/banking sector fundamentals could be either capturing cyclical factors (e.g., weak activity affecting banks’ balance sheets) or more idiosyncratic banking shocks (e.g., an increase in bank regulation). Knowing which variables in the lender-countries matter as drivers of cross-border bank lending to EMs is especially relevant in the current context, as monetary policies in the US and EA are often at different points of their monetary cycles, and their banking sectors have recovered differently from the crisis, owing to differences in the macroeconomic conditions of these two economic blocs.====In this context, we estimate a couple of models where US and EA shocks are jointly identified, through contemporaneous sign restrictions, and used in two-economy panel VAR models.==== These models have two sets of variables in each model. The first set includes an external set of variables from ==== US ==== EA, capturing monetary policy, financial variables, and economic cyclical conditions. The second set includes variables in the EM borrowing country, namely GDP growth, the real effective exchange rate, and received cross-border bank flows. In the first model we focus on monetary and cyclical external shocks, with the identifying assumptions following from a subset of the over-identifying restrictions in ====. A further enlargement of the model includes financial/banking shocks through the introduction of a sign restriction identification based on ====’s model.==== The estimated external shocks are then used in the panel two-economy VAR estimations.====The results highlight the positive impact of real shocks originating in the EA, as well as in the US, but to a lower degree, on cross-border bank lending to EMs.==== Both a US and a EA monetary tightening has a significant negative impact on cross-border lending, but the results indicate that this is especially the case for US monetary policy because EA monetary policy seems to be only significant in the case of cross-border bank flows to European EMs. This is to be expected given that loans and funding are mostly in US dollars in the remaining EMs in our sample.==== In the more general model, monetary and real sector policy shocks in the US as well as monetary shocks in the EA are very similar, independently of whether we add the financial sector. However, this is not the case for real shocks in the EA, which lose importance and statistical significance when including the financial sector. The universal bank model in the EA seems to be more correlated with the economic cycle than the financial intermediaries in the US. Hence, without including the financial sector, the small model seems to assign a larger role to real sector shocks than warranted. The impact of the financial sector on cross-border lending is also interesting. A negative financial shock in the US triggers a decline in cross-border lending to EMs, especially lending to EMs banks. While this is also the case for EA financial shocks propagating to Latam, Asia, and banks in Emerging Europe, the impact of the financial shocks in EA triggers an increase of cross-border lending to the non-bank sector in Europe, probably due to regulatory arbitrage.====Our results complement and contribute to the literature in three main aspects. First, they support the papers which agree that a US monetary tightening decreases cross-border bank flows to EMs. The evidence in the literature on US monetary policy is mixed. Many papers find that cross-border lending responds negatively to a tightening in US monetary policy (====; ====; ====, etc.); others find monetary policy variables are not always significant, or do not consistently have the same sign (e.g., ====, ====), with some even finding opposite signs (e.g., ====, and ====). Our results were consistently negative not only in the case of overall lending to EMs, but also across regional breakdowns and type of borrowers (banks and non-banks).====Second, but not less important, they put into context the findings of ==== on the importance of taking into account EA shocks. In this context of performing an analysis that takes into account the endogeneity of the different key variables within and between the US and EA, our results validate their results that European bank conditions are important, but we do find in our approaches that US financial shocks (e.g., triggering a decrease in bank leverage) on cross-border lending are as important, and even more consistently negative than EA financial shocks. We also confirm their finding that US monetary policy plays a more global role than EA monetary policy. Moreover, our results even strengthen their argument that this is driven by the US dollar as the dominant currency in cross-border lending, since we find that EA monetary shocks matter in the case of Emerging Europe where cross-border lending is mostly denominated in euros. This is in line with the recent analysis by ==== that global funding currencies play a key role in international monetary policy transmission.====Last, but not least, our results provide further evidence on how the impact of tightening macroprudential measures usually results in lower cross-border lending, but not always. Both of our models capture that a negative EA financial shock would increase cross-border lending in Emerging Europe. This latter evolution would be consistent with the type of regulatory arbitrage highlighted by ====, which finds that tighter regulation in the source country encourages credit outflows. On the other hand, ==== find that an increase in capital requirements in the UK is associated with a reduction in some types cross-border lending. More generally, ====In the context of divergence in the economic cycle in US and EA (e.g., pre-Covid-19 pandemic shock, the recovery has been stronger in the US after the Global Financial Crisis which resulted in an earlier tightening of the US monetary policy than in the EA), our findings have clear policy implications. Even though the US Federal Reserve and the ==== set their policies as a function of the economic cycle in their respective areas, their effects are different due to the nature of the currency denomination of cross-border lending (mostly US dollar denominated outside Emerging Europe), as well as the business and funding model of European banks, which play a large role in cross-border lending. A tightening in the US monetary policy would most likely trigger a reduction in cross-border banking flows to EMs (especially through the appreciation of the US dollar), which could be partially offset as a function of the evolution of the real economy in EA as well as improvements in US and EA bank fundamentals, rather than a more expansionary EA monetary policy. These policy implications could be relevant for the recovery period after the Covid-19 shock. Similar to the GFC, there could be differences in the recovery speed between the US and EA.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

This result is associated with higher capital-to-labor ratios of listed firms, consistent with diminishing marginal returns of capital. In other words, lower ==== reflects less financial constraints of listed firms. We, thus, refer to the ==== difference as ====.====More specifically, for each country, we estimate the listing advantages by the average treatment effect on the return on assets (====), using the propensity score matching technique. We find that, for the majority of the countries in our study, listing lowers ====, which is proportional to the marginal products of capital under typical assumptions on production functions.====This finding supports a simple theory, which says that listing firms should be less financially constrained. As long as diminishing marginal returns prevail, any financial constraints limiting investments raise the marginal product of capital of a firm more than its unconstrained level. Indeed, in many countries, listing is negatively correlated with debt-to-asset ratio, implying that equity finance works as a source of financing. Furthermore, maintaining lower leverage makes listed firms less likely to hit the prohibitive borrowing constraints.====Next, we investigate the institutional factors behind different levels of listing advantages across countries. We find that stronger creditor’s rights tends to narrow the listing advantages, while corporate governance seems to play mixed roles. Notably, legal origins of countries show robust effects. Compared to English origin, countries with German and Scandinavian legal origin strongly narrow the listed advantages, consistent with creditor’s right’s effect. On the other hand, French legal origin shows mixed effects. Note that creditor’s rights are said to be protected more under German and Scandinavian legal-origin countries than others.====Although cross-country studies are rare, several country-specific studies, so far, identify the advantages of listing. Ueda et al. (2019), using Japanese firm-level data over the period 1995–2014, find that listing can mitigate the financial constraints of firms. Compared to a similar unlisted firm, a listed firm has a lower marginal product of capital, especially in recessions. French et al. (2020), in their study using Japanese firm-level data, find similar results with even more detailed investigations. Schoubben and Van Hulle (2011), using the Belgian firm-level data (from 1992 to 2005) with consolidated financial statements, find that listing provides more flexibility in financing and reduces the financial constraints. Gilje and Taillard (2016), based on panel regressions, show that listed natural gas firms in the U.S. have a higher sensitivity to gas price movements (i.e., growth opportunities) than the unlisted rivals in the same industry. The difference is more pronounced in shale gas investments, which are more capital intensive. For British firms, Saunders and Steffen (2011) find that the listed firms enjoy lower bank loan rates. In their European cross-country study, Mortal and Reisel (2013) report that listed firms have higher investment sensitivity on growth opportunities (proxied by sales growth) and such tendencies are higher for countries with more developed stock markets.====Other authors find that listing results in the tightening of financial constraints. Stein (1989) argues that it may be possible, theoretically, as a result of the worsening of agency problems under sparse ownership. For US firms, Asker et al. (2014) show that US-listed firms are more short-termist in nature, that is, they are less sensitive to growth opportunities (proxied by sales growth). Sheen (2019) also shows that the US listing firms in chemical industries have a lower sensitivity of capacity investment on demand shocks.====Mixed evidences are sometimes reported by several authors. For British firms, Brav (2009) shows that listed firms have lower leverage, but with lower fluctuations in the capital structure. In their European cross country study, Goyal et al. (2011) also report that listed firms have lower leverage, but with more active management on leverage. They find that this difference between listed and the unlisted firms is more pronounced in countries with stronger creditor’s rights. For Japanese firms, Orihara (2014) presents univariate pictures that show listed firms have lower investments on average but with lower fluctuations in investment over business cycles. Orihara and Isobe (2014) report that the listed firms have lower leverage, though with minimal control variables in their regressions.====In another strand of the literature, based on listed firms’ data, many authors have explained the cross-country differences in financial frictions associated with the differences in institutional factors. Claessens et al. (2014), using an improved version of the standard investment model, estimate how institutions affect financial frictions at the firm (micro) level and, through the required rate of return, at the country (macro) level. Based on listed firm-level panel data from 40 countries over the period from 1990 to 2007, they show that shareholder rights affect financial frictions while creditor’s rights do not. Abiad et al. (2008) show that the cross-sectional dispersion of listed-firms’ Tobin’s Q, which is regarded as a measure of the ex-ante efficiency of capital allocation, improves with financial liberalizations.====Few, if not none, so far, have studied the role of institutional factors on financial constraints between the listed and the unlisted firms using the cross-country panel data. In this paper, using both listed and unlisted firms data, we, thus, try to find extensive margins of institutional factors on listing-related financial frictions, compared to intensive margins found so far in previous studies among listed-firms in cross-country setting.",Listing advantages around the world,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158320300265,20 June 2020,2020,Research Article,80.0

Even when an FX intervention moves the level of the FX rate in its intending direction, this movement is transient unless the intervention mitigates the volatility and dissolves the dispersion among market participants. I adopt pulse and step functions to examine the short-run dynamic effects of four recent Japanese FX interventions on the level and volatility of the yen/dollar rate. The four interventions are large and public, and these are important factors in the effectiveness of the intervention. I find that the two recent interventions are successful in terms of persistent depreciation and mitigating volatility. The two successful interventions are characterized by their size effect. In turn, although the third intervention caused the yen to depreciate, this is short-lived because of increasing volatility.","One common finding among researchers is that a large and public foreign exchange (FX) intervention is effective in terms of moving the level of the FX rate (e.g., Fratzscher et al. [2019]; Takagi [2014];Fatum and Yamamoto [2014]). The four recent Japanese interventions fulfill these two conditions. I examine the dynamics of the level and volatility of the yen/dollar rate (price of yen per US dollar) after each intervention and find that the efficacy of the intervention is persistent when it mitigates volatility. Although my sample is limited, the results indicate that a large and public intervention is successful only when it has good communication with the market and dissolves the uncertainty in the market. The two successful interventions are characterized by their “size effect.” Although the Bank of Japan (BOJ) did not intervene in the FX market after 2011, the results of this study provide a valuable lesson for possible future interventions by the BOJ.====My main finding is that the second and fourth interventions had good communication with the market, and therefore mitigated volatility. The yen depreciation is persistent after each intervention. The former intervention is coordinated with the leading central banks, while the latter is a historically massive intervention (nine trillion yen). I expect that the aggregate size of the former intervention is large enough to strength its effectiveness. Therefore, I consider that their size effect enhances the signaling value of the intervention operation. The size effect refers to an FX intervention with a size large enough to send a strong and clear massage to enhance its effectiveness.====Researchers should examine FX interventions in terms of its effect on both the level and volatility of the FX rate. Even when an FX intervention moves the level in its intending direction, this movement is short-lived unless the market persistently agrees with the new level. When the market participants disagree to the new level; that is, their opinions are dispersed, the volatility of the FX rate increases and the efficacy of the intervention is transient. Therefore, lower volatility should follow a successful intervention, thus reflecting market confidence in the new level. I introduce truncated-step and pulse functions and examine the effects of the Japanese FX intervention on the level and volatility of the daily yen/dollar rate. Notably, unlike prior studies, since the step effect is truncated depending on the data generating process, my truncated step function can replicate similar series of the yen/dollar rate and volatility with actual data. I show that the non-truncated step function overvalues the BOJ intervention effectiveness in one case. Additionally, the novelty of this study is that I examine the dynamics of the level and volatility of the yen/dollar rate and suggest that a successful intervention needs to mitigate volatility.====I observe a spike in the yen/dollar rate the day the BOJ intervenes in the yen/dollar market. Some previous studies on BOJ intervention insist that a rebound in the yen/dollar rate partly cancels its effect (e.g., Chen and Huang [2008]; Hoshikawa [2017]). Their results indicate that the spike must be partly cancelled out within a few days of the BOJ intervention. To model this effect, I adopt Box and Tiao's (1975) step and pulse functions and examine the four recent BOJ interventions. This empirical model gives a rich picture of the dynamics of the level and volatility of the yen/dollar rate after an intervention. I postulate that a spike followed by lower volatility will be long-lived because the market participants persistently accept the new FX rate level and their opinions are not split. In addition to the level of the yen/dollar rate, I use these functions to examine the dynamics of the volatility after an intervention and whether lower volatility follows a long-lived spike in the FX rate.====Few studies use these functions with actual BOJ intervention data, despite Box and Tiao having developed them in 1975 to analyze the dynamic characteristics of policy intervention. Researchers applied these functions in diverse fields (e.g., medical issues in Smulowitz et al., [2018]). Chen and Huang (2008) use them to examine the effect of the joint US-Japanese FX intervention on June 17, 1998. However, they merely examine the one-day effect on the yen/dollar rate and not its volatility. They adopt simple pulse and step functions—the latter is not truncated—and discuss only their statistical significance.====I assume that the stochastic process of the yen/dollar rate is a random walk without drift before the BOJ intervention, and the step and pulse effects appear thereafter. Once the step function is truncated, the yen/dollar rate process becomes a random walk again. I estimate the parameters related to the step and pulse functions, calculate the daily step and pulse effects, and their cumulative sums to examine the dynamics of the yen/dollar rate after a BOJ intervention.====I also examine the effect of a BOJ intervention on the volatility of the yen/dollar rate return with the step and pulse functions. Since realized volatility, the sum of the squared five-minute returns, is consistent with the assumption of a random walk process of the yen/dollar rate, I adopt it as a latent variable for volatility. I also adopt high-low volatility (Parkinson [1980]) to check the robustness of the results.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review. Section 3 introduces the empirical model. Section 4 outlines the four recent BOJ interventions and reports the empirical results supporting the effectiveness of these two interventions.

We use Japanese Labour Force Survey microdata to construct, for workers disaggregated by age, gender, education, and marital status, flows among different labor market statuses. Our analysis finds that the probability of finding and retaining a regular job varies substantially with education level and especially with marital status. In particular, college graduates, and within each gender, married males and never married females, are most strongly attached to regular employment.","The Japanese labor market was traditionally known for its strong job attachment, often referred to as “lifetime employment”. Over the years, however, Japan has seen a dramatic increase in unstable jobs. As observed from Fig. 1, the share of regular employees who enjoy strong job protection, around 85% in 1984, declined by more than 20 percentage points over the past 35 years. This rising trend in job insecurity is not unique to Japan; it has drawn much attention in many European economies. Countries such as Spain implemented labor market reforms in the mid-1980s and 1990s that resulted in large rises in temporary employment like that seen in Japan. The Japanese experience provides a unique case study, because such labor market changes have occurred at the same time that Japan faced a shift in demographics from the aging of its population, the most severe in the world.====While Fig. 1 conveys a striking message for Japan, it does not provide a complete illustration of the issue of non-regular employment, since the increase in the share of non-regular employees could be driven by changes in worker composition. For example, increased re-entry into the labor force by married women who had quit working due to marriage or childbirth increases the share of non-regular employees, since such re-entrants often work in part-time and other non-regular jobs. The aging of Japan’s population also increases non-regular employment, since many older workers switch from regular to non-regular jobs after reaching retirement age. Since unstable, non-regular jobs may hold differing implications for different groups of workers, it is important to understand the evolution and current state of non-regular employment for workers with various characteristics.====This paper’s main objective is to provide detailed understanding of the issue of non-regular employment for workers disaggregated by age, gender, education, and marital status. To achieve this goal, we use Labour Force Survey (LFS) microdata and begin by presenting age profiles of the share of regular employees and two key labor market variables, unemployment and participation rates, for different groups of workers. To examine the mechanisms underlying these age profiles, we then compute age profiles of the flows between different labor market statuses, again for workers disaggregated by said characteristics. Further, we conduct counterfactual experiments to explore the relative importance of flows into and out of regular employment, as well as initial labor market statuses in generating age profiles of the share of regular employees. Then, we conduct several regression analyses to examine how labor market flows vary with marital status for workers of different education levels, and vice versa.====The data show that regular employment is more prevalent for males than females, for those with more education, and within gender for married males and never married females. Our main findings in terms of worker flows are as follows. First, males who are married or have a college degree enjoy greater chances of flowing into and staying in regular employment. Second, females with a college degree or some college education are more likely to obtain and keep regular jobs, while the opposite is true for married females. Third, differences in flow rates by marital status tend to dominate differences by educational attainment. Fourth, for both genders, labor market flows of widowed or divorced generally lie between the flows of never married and married. To our best knowledge, that labor market flows in Japan differ substantially by marital status, not only for females (as is expected) but also for males, is a novel finding. Regression analyses show that these key differences across education levels and marital status found from the worker flow analysis are statistically significant. Finally, our counterfactual experiment suggests that outflows from regular employment, which have drawn less attention than inflows to regular jobs, play a significant role in creating the differences in the share of regular employees across different groups of workers.====The present paper is related to the empirical literature on non-regular employment in Japan. Asano et al., 2013 use LFS data from 1986 to 2008 to explore the importance of changes in demographic and industrial composition on the increase in non-standard workers. Ohashi (2017) conducts a similar decomposition analysis using Employment Status Survey data for 2002, 2007, and 2012. Kambayashi (2017) provides detailed analyses of the Japanese labor market, contrasting regular and non-regular employment. Teruyama et al., 2018 use an administrative firm survey and examine the firm-level determinants of the increased demand for non-regular workers. Yokoyama et al. (2019) find that regular workers tend to self-select into practical training which yields high returns, while non-regular workers are more likely to choose training with lower returns such as schooling. None of these studies, however, conduct worker flow analysis as in the present paper. Using a similar approach as ours, Esteban-Pretel et al. (2011b) compute worker flows disaggregated by various worker characteristics. The definitions of contingent and regular employee in Esteban-Pretel et al. (2011b) are, however, based on length of contract, which differs from the definitions of ‘non-regular employee’ and ‘regular employee’ in this paper.====Since one key difference between regular and non-regular employment lies in job security, our paper also relates to the literature on changes to lifetime employment in Japan. Ono (2010) finds that while the share of core workers enjoying lifetime employment decreased over time, the job separation probability of core workers remained stable. Hamaaki et al., 2012 show that since the early 2000s, the share of lifetime employees decreased among younger workers with university education. Kambayashi and Kato, 2017 argue that job stability of prime-age male workers did not deteriorate significantly during Japan’s “Lost Decade”, while that of mid-career hires and young workers did decline. Our paper provides a new perspective on this topic by presenting a detailed flow analysis that sheds light on the mechanism behind increased job insecurity.",Non-regular employment over the life-cycle: Worker flow analysis for Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158320300253,20 May 2020,2020,Research Article,82.0

Using a panel of Japanese firms, we compare listed and unlisted firms and conduct ==== to examine causal relationships. The results indicate that the rapid increase in the number of outside directors among listed firms did not promote active investments or risk-taking behavior. In addition, it had no significant impacts on the profitability and productivity of the firms.","This study uses a large panel of Japanese firms and presents evidence on the impact of outside directors on firms’ investment behavior and performance. Following an amendment to the Corporate Law and the introduction of the Corporate Governance Code, the number of independent outside directors in listed Japanese firms increased rapidly. We can view this change in board composition as a quasi-natural experiment, similar to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act in the U.S.====Since the middle of 2010s, the Japanese government enforced policies to promote corporate governance reforms, particularly by increasing the number of independent outside directors on the boards of listed firms. The purpose of these reforms was to encourage Japanese firms to proactively use their earnings to invest and improve their profitability and productivity. For example, the government's economic growth strategy (Japan Revitalization Strategy, 2013) states that “in order to back up aggressive business management, the government will encourage active use of outside directors.” Thus, based on the literature on the role of corporate boards, the government expects outside directors to find profitable new investment opportunities through its advising function and to support aggressive strategy taken by management team through its monitoring function.==== Following the economic growth strategy, the government amended the Corporate Law in 2014 and introduced the Corporate Governance Code in 2015. The Corporate Governance Code makes clear the roles and responsibilities of independent directors (Principle 4.7) such as “provision of advice on business policies and business improvement” and “monitoring of the management through important decision-making at the board.”====The Corporate Governance Code forced listed firms to explain, at both annual shareholder meetings and in annual reports, why they do not have independent outside directors on the board if this is the case.==== Since this is a “comply or explain” style of rule, appointing independent outside directors is not strictly a statutory obligation. However, in practice, the rules put strong pressure on listed firms because it is not easy to give convincing reasons for not appointing independent outside directors. In 2018, the government amended the Corporate Governance Code to increase the number of independent outside directors and to ensure gender diversity on corporate boards.====Following the adoption of these policies, the number of outside directors has been increasing rapidly within listed firms, in sharp contrast to the unlisted firms that these policies do not affect. According to the Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities (BSJBSA) conducted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the percentage of listed firms with at least one outside director shows an increasing trend, particularly since 2014, and reached 87% in 2017 (panel A of Table 1). In contrast, the percentage of unlisted firms with outside directors is hovering around 46%. The mean share of outside directors on the boards of listed firms also increased from 13% in 2011 to 25% in 2017, but the figure is stable around 18% for unlisted firms (panel B of Table 1). The table also shows that the increase in outside directors reflects the increase in the number of independent outside directors (column (2) of the table). All of these trends indicate that only listed firms responded to the pressure from the corporate governance reform.====As we discuss in the next section, several studies investigate the effects of outside directors on firm behavior and performance, but such studies for Japanese firms are limited. Since the decision to increase outside directors is endogenous, simply observing the relationship between board composition and the behavior or performance of the firms cannot reveal causality. In this respect, this study contributes to the literature by exploiting the recent change in board composition in Japan arising from a quasi-natural policy experiment to examine the causal impacts of (independent) outside directors empirically. Specifically, we try to identify a causal relationship through (1) comparing listed and non-listed firms in a variant of difference-in-difference (DID) framework and (2) conducting instrumental variable estimations for listed firms.====From the analysis, we do not detect evidence that the increase in the number of outside directors among listed firms promotes active investments and risk-taking behavior. In addition, it has no significant impacts on the profitability and productivity of the affected firms. These results are consistent with the view repeatedly expressed in the literature that the optimal board composition differs depending on the firm's characteristics (e.g., Coles ====., 2008; Duchin ====., 2010; Miyajima and Ogawa, 2012; Schmidt, 2015).====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.

Our regression model underscores that public pension and other related programs, taken together, discourage the elderly from working. Based on the regression results, we conduct simulations to show the extent to which the three policy reforms can encourage the elderly to stay in the labor force longer and work longer hours: (1) abolishing the earnings test for pension benefits; (2) raising the eligibility age for pension benefits; and (3) extending the wage subsidy for the elderly. The simulation results highlight the relative effectiveness of raising the eligibility age.","Japan's aging population is expected to have a substantial impact on its economy, not only because it will reduce the size of the labor force but because it is likely to put financial pressure on the sustainability of public pension programs. Public pension programs were originally designed to provide social insurance against the risk of a lower ability to earn because of aging. While fulfilling this expected role, public pension programs have also had less beneficial consequences, including discouraging the elderly from staying in the labor force. Many studies have provided evidence of the negative impact of public pension programs on elderly labor supply and examined the effects of a series of recent pension reforms (e.g., Alonso-Ortiz, 2014; Coile, 2015; Gruber and Wise, 1999; Oshio et al., 2011).====In addition, numerous studies have examined how public pension reforms have affected or would affect the elderly labor supply. For example, Gruber and Wise (2007) compared the simulated impacts of increasing eligibility ages across advanced countries, and many similar studies have followed (e.g., Atalay and Barrett, 2015; Duggan et al., 2007; Staubli and Zweimüller, 2013). The impact of eliminating earnings tests on the elderly labor supply has been another key issue associated with pension reforms. Many studies have found that it has a positive impact on the elderly labor supply, although the observed magnitude of the impact has substantially differed among the studies (Disney and Smith, 2002; Engelhardt and Kumar, 2009; Gruber and Orszag, 2003; Haider and Loughran, 2008).====This study aims to investigate how the employment of the elderly in Japan is associated with public pension and related programs, using a population-based, longitudinal survey data of middle-aged and older individuals. Based on the regression results, we then simulate the impacts of public pension and related policy reforms on the decisions of the elderly with respect to work, retirement, and hours to work. The results are expected to provide significant policy implications for addressing the institutional disincentives to elderly employment in Japan.====In terms of analytic strategy, this study has three features. First, it incorporates various factors related to disincentives to work, including public pension and related programs, into a single index of implicit tax (ITAX), rather than examining the relevance of each factor separately. ITAX is a concept proposed and investigated in the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)’s project “International Social Security” (Coile et al., 2020). We construct ITAX based on various institutional factors and compute its value for all individuals in each survey year by including the public programs that actually applied to them (Oshio et al., 2020). The most remarkable benefit of using ITAX is that it allows us to capture each institutional disincentive consistently in the form of an implicit tax on additional work—that is, the extent to which income will be affected by working one more year.====Second, using ITAX, we can compare the impacts of three policy reforms: (1) abolishing the earnings test for pension benefits; (2) raising the eligibility age for pension benefits; and (3) extending the wage subsidy for the elderly on the their decisions about work, retirement, and hours to work. Japanese studies have found mixed evidence on the impact of the earnings test program and its reforms (Ishii and Kurosawa, 2009; Shimizutani and Oshio, 2013; Yamada, 2012), with some showing that an increase in the eligibility age encouraged participation in the labor force (Ishii and Kurosawa, 2009; Kondo and Shigeoka, 2017). However, the impacts of these reforms have been estimated separately, making comparisons difficult. There have been few attempts to simulate and compare the policy impacts within a common framework.====We address this issue by unitizing ITAX—specifically, by (1) integrating existing institutional incentives into ITAX; (2) observing the relationship between ITAX and the elderly labor supply; (3) incorporating policy reforms into changes in ITAX; and then (4) calculating their impacts on the elderly labor supply. This methodology can help us assess the relative impact of each reform on elderly employment overall from a viewpoint of the financial incentive to work, which is most likely a key determinant of individuals’ decisions about whether to retire or work and for how many hours.====Third, we distinguish between full-time and part-time work, rather than characterizing the elderly's decisions as a dichotomous choice between work and retirement==== a substantial proportion of Japanese employees, after retiring from their primary full-time work, shift to part-time work rather than quitting the labor force entirely (Shimizutani, 2011; Shimizutani and Oshio, 2010). Claiming pension benefits in Japan does not necessarily mean retirement; as will be described later, a substantial proportion of Japanese pensioners are working even after having retired from their primary jobs. To assess the relevance of the estimation results, we further investigate how the average number of hours worked, which is a continuous variable and roughly corresponds to total labor supply, is associated with public pension and other related programs.====The current study has several limitations. Among others, we do not consider the possibility of couples’ joint retirement decisions—that is, cases where both spouses’ retirement behaviors are influenced by the spillover effects from one spouse's retirement and benefit claims (Atalay et al., 2019; Coile, 2004), due to limited information available in the dataset about spouses’ retirement behaviors. We also ignore the simultaneity of decisions concerning retirement and claiming, and thus we focus mainly on the retirement decision. Furthermore, we focus exclusively on the aspects of policy reform that can be incorporated into the change in ITAX, ignores potential differences in individuals’ behavioral responses to different policy reforms. Hence, we cannot rule out the case that individuals might respond differently to policy reforms. These three limitations suggest the need for caution in interpreting our estimation and simulation results.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the data and institutional background. Section 3 presents the computation of ITAX and a descriptive analysis of its evolution and decomposition. Section 4 discusses the regression analysis to examine the association of ITAX with elderly decisions about whether and how much to work.

A question is how firms save the costs of these frequent lateral transfers given the existence of job-specific skills. This paper proposes a new theory of the transition across jobs based on the assumption that each job consists of tasks and that each of these tasks requires specific skills. This shows that firms synchronize the promotions and lateral transfers of their employees to reduce the cost of transferring to the employee those task-specific skills required for a new position. We find that this unique prediction is broadly supported by a large personnel data set in Japan.,"The recent empirical literature finds that frequent and broad lateral transfers increase the possibility of promotion (Dohmen, Kriechel, Pfann, 2004, Ariga, 2006, Frederiksen, Kato, 2017, Jin, Waldman, 2019). For the most part, these studies argue that as higher-ranked positions are likely to require broader skills, the lateral transfer of promising people tends to be both broad and frequent. However, although the supporting evidence is interesting and this basic argument plausible,==== an unresolved question remains: how do firms reduce the cost of the frequent lateral transfer of promising employees? As each job requires particular skills specific to that job, the frequent lateral transfer of promising employees is likely to increase the cost of acquiring skills. Internal career paths to top management positions must then be designed in such a way as to minimize these costs.====Gibbons and Waldman (2004) propose an interesting conjecture about the principle of career paths: namely, that promotion paths should be structured so as to minimize the underutilization of task-specific human capital when promotion occurs. They argue that when workers are promoted, they should be promoted to a position that makes use of the skills they acquired in their previous job. They provide several plausible examples that are consistent with this conjecture. Furthermore, Gibbons and Waldman (2006) provide a formal model of promotion with task-specific skills, while Jin and Waldman (2019) extend the model to include lateral transfers. However, how a firm minimizes the cost of frequent lateral transfers remains an open question.====This paper proposes a new theory of job transition based on the assumption that each job involves a set of tasks, and that each task requires skills specific to that task. We also assume that a job has multidimensional characteristics such as rank, functional department, and location, and that transfer to a different job incurs a reallocation cost. Hence, we can analyze how a firm can minimize the reallocation cost arising from the lateral transfer of promoted employees. The theory shows that if a firm attempts to save the reallocation cost resulting from the need to transfer to the employee those task-specific skills required for his or her new position, the probability of a job transfer that changes a particular characteristic, such as functional department, is higher when the job transfer changes another characteristic, such as rank.====The predictions of our theory can be applied not only to the relationship between a promotion and a lateral transfer, but also to that between two different types of lateral transfers, such as movement across functional departments and movement across different locations. However, for explanatory simplicity, in this introduction we explain how the theory accounts for the synchronization of promotion and lateral transfer.====We first show that the synchronization of promotion and lateral transfer occurs if and only if the reallocation cost is strictly submodular with respect to promotion and lateral transfer. Because being strictly submodular with respect to promotion and lateral transfer means that the marginal cost of a lateral transfer is strictly smaller when promotion occurs than when it does not, our result can be interpreted as indicating that the synchronization of promotion and lateral transfer occurs if and only if the marginal cost of a lateral transfer is strictly smaller when promotion occurs than when it does not.====This observation raises a deeper question: what makes the reallocation cost submodular with respect to promotion and lateral transfer? We propose a theory based on the assumption that each job comprises a set of tasks, and that each task requires skills specific to that task. We show that the reallocation cost resulting from transferring the task-specific skills required for a new position is in general submodular with respect to promotion and lateral transfer, and that it is strictly submodular if and only if the task-specific skills required for the new functional department (the new location) and new ranked position overlap. This means that a firm is likely to synchronize promotion and lateral transfer decisions because it can reduce the cost of transferring new skills thanks to the duplication of the required task-specific skills between the new rank and the new functional department (the new location).====To better understand the intuition, suppose that both a director and an accountant perform the same types of tasks, such as analyzing data. Once a firm decides to promote an employee to the role of director, the employee must learn how to analyze data anyway. Hence, the additional reallocation cost of a transfer to the accounting department (i.e., the cost on top of that involved in the promotion) does not include the cost of acquiring data analysis skills. This means that the additional reallocation cost of a job transfer to the accounting department is smaller when the promotion occurs than when it does not. We show that this intuition is true under fairly mild conditions.====Note that for a new task-specific skill to be duplicated across the new functional department (location) and ranked position, there must exist common tasks, and therefore, common skills between functional departments (or locations) and ranks. As common skills are transferable only across particular jobs, these cannot be derived from the standard dichotomy between general and job-specific human capital. That is, only task-specific human capital can derive the synchronization.====Finally, our theory also shows that if the marginal benefits from multitask skills are greater for higher-ranked managers than lower-ranked managers, as implied by recent evidence such as Frederiksen and Kato (2017), the higher-ranked managers are more likely to be transferred to other functional departments (or other locations). We empirically examine this last prediction together with the synchronization of multidimensional job transfers.====For this purpose, we investigate personnel data based on the information files for directors (Bucho) and section managers (Kacho) in major Japanese manufacturing companies between 1998 and 2005. We find three robust facts that are consistent with the predictions of our theory: 1) the probability of being transferred to another functional department or location is greater when promotion occurs than when it does not; 2) the probability of being transferred to another functional department is greater when the employee is simultaneously transferred to another location, and vice versa; 3) directors are more frequently transferred to other functional departments than section managers.====The obtained results are robust. Although the meaning of rank, functional department, and location might differ across companies, we find the same pattern of job transitions from several different subsamples when separated by year, firm size, and other firm characteristics. Hence, it is less likely that the evidence is a result of measurement error. We can thus safely conclude that the evidence appears consistent with our theoretical prediction.====To the best of our knowledge, there is not yet any explicit model that can explain our findings theoretically. Eriksson and Ortega (2006) identify three promising theories of job rotation: job rotation makes employees acquire multitask skills [e.g., Koike, 1991and Jin and Waldman (2019)], helps employers learn about employees’ abilities [e.g., Ortega (2001)], and mitigates boredom [e.g. Cosgel and Miceli, 1999]. Alternatively, Ickes and Samuelson (1987) and Eguchi, 2004, Eguchi, 2005 argue that job transfers can be used to prevent workers encountering moral hazard. Finally, Ariga (2006) points out that job creation and destruction as a result of changes in demand can also influence the pattern of lateral transfer. However, none of these theories is designed to explain the timing of lateral transfer.====The importance of task-specific skills is pointed out by several recent studies [e.g., Lazear, 2009, Gathmann, Christina, Schönberg, 2010, Gibbons, Waldman, 2004, Gibbons, Waldman, 2006]. However, none of these explicitly models lateral transfers in the firm. An exception is Jin and Waldman (2019), whose model focuses on the role of lateral transfers as a way of accumulating the multiple task-specific skills needed in upper-level job positions. However, Jin and Waldman (2019) do not question how the firm minimizes the cost of lateral transfers for promising workers. In contrast, we pay more attention to the task-specific skills needed in lower-level jobs, which allows us to explain the timing of lateral transfers.====Finally, since Doeringer and Piore (1971) introduced the concept of an internal labor market into economics, much evidence has accumulated. While the majority of empirical studies on internal labor markets focus on promotion [e.g., Rosenbaum, 1984, Medoff, Abraham, 1980, Medoff, Abraham, 1981, Baker, Gibbs, Holmstrom, 1994a, Baker, Gibbs, Holmstrom, 1994b, Ariga, Ohkusa, Brunello, 1999, Seltzer, Merrett, 2000, Treble, Bridges, van Gameren, 2001, Lin, 2005, Kauhanen, Napari, 2012]====, there is some evidence relating to lateral transfers [e.g., Koike, 1991, Kakizawa, Matsushige, Yuasa, Katakura, Nakatani, 2004, Gibbs, Hendricks, 2004, Dohmen, Kriechel, Pfann, 2004, Gittings, 2012]. Nevertheless, there is currently no study that identifies the synchronization of the promotion and lateral transfer decisions.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our model and provides the conditions for a reallocation cost function under which the synchronization of promotion and lateral transfer occurs. Section 3 shows how task-specific human capital can explain the derived condition on the reallocation cost function. Section 4 empirically investigates personnel data based on the information files for directors (Bucho) and section managers (Kacho) in major Japanese manufacturing companies. In this, we pay particular attention to the timing of lateral transfer.

Our estimates show that lending competition intensifies in markets where banks hold more slack liquidity caused by monetary easing, and where loan demand is less elastic against lowering ==== due to a rapidly aging population. We also find evidence for “search-for-yield”, i.e., banks in more competitive markets are driven to extend riskier loans.","A large number of recent empirical studies present evidence for the risk-taking channel of monetary easing (e.g., Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, Saurina, 2014, Dell’Ariccia, Laeven, Suarez, 2017, among others). Regarding this channel, existing theory gives two opposite predictions. The traditional risk-shifting theory predicts that monetary easing will reduce bank risk taking because the lower funding cost reduces the benefit of taking additional risks by abusing the protection of limited liability (Keeley, 1990). On the other hand, the search-for-yield theory (Dell’Ariccia, Laeven, Marquez, 2014, Martinez-Miera, Repullo, 2017) predicts that monetary easing increases bank risk taking because monetary easing diminishes the spread between the loan interest rate and funding cost, and so discourages banks from costly monitoring or screening against risky borrowers. Which of these counteracting forces dominates is determined by the extent of penetration from low funding costs to loan interest rates, which depends on the competitive mode of banks and loan demand elasticity (Dell’Ariccia et al., 2014). Despite the abundant evidence for the risk-taking channel of monetary easing, we lack evidence of these determinants of price penetration. The present study is an attempt to fill this gap in empirical studies by using the dataset collected from Japanese loan market, which have faced the prolonged monetary easing since 1999 and the more aggressive quantitative easing since 2013.====The first step toward this goal is the structural estimation of the key parameters: the competitive mode of banks and loan demand elasticity in Japanese local loan market. The traditional structural estimation methods in an empirical industrial organization provide us with good tools for the simultaneous estimation of these parameters (Iwata, 1974, Bresnahan, 1982, Lau, 1982, Porter, 1983). In this strand of the literature, competitive mode is measured by a parameter indicating the response of total market supply to a one-unit increase of supply by one supplier, which we call the degree of competition. This methodology has already been applied to the loan market by many existing studies (e.g., Coccorese, 2005, Coccorese, 2009, Uchida, Tsutsui, 2005, Delis, Tsionas, 2009).==== We refine this traditional method in two ways by making use of the data of loan-loss provision and branch location that became available in the 2000s in Japan. First, we explicitly control for the loan-loss provision, which can inflate the loan spread and confound with the effect of lending competition. Second, we introduce the regional heterogeneity in demand elasticity and the degree of competition. This heterogeneity allows us to examine the regional determinants of these key parameters, such as population aging and excess reserve of banks in each region.====In the second step, we test the sign of the correlation between the estimated degree of competition and bank risk taking by the linear regression with the region and year fixed effects. In this step, we test whether the search-for-yield theory or the risk-shifting theory is at work. To our knowledge, the degree of lending competition estimated from a structural estimation has never been used in testing for these hypotheses in the existing studies.====The above structural estimation requires market-year panel data consisting of bank financial information including risk taking, and the economic data in each market. We construct our panel data by taking the share-weighted average of the financial variables of each bank with a branch in each market. We assume the loan market is geographically segmented by prefecture, following existing studies using Japanese data (e.g., Ishikawa and Tsutsui, 2013). The existing studies suggest that a loan market could be narrower than the prefecture (Degryse, Ongena, 2005, Ono, Saito, Sakai, Uesugi, 2016), but we use the prefecture segmentation assumption because it is the smallest geographical unit for which we can obtain consistent economic data. To measure market share, we use the proportion of all bank branches in each prefecture that each bank represents because we do not have loan share information. As a robustness check, we also use the branch share adjusted by the average size of branches of each bank, to address the possibility that branch size is positively correlated with bank size.====To measure the extent of bank risk taking, we use the ratio of loan-loss provision over the total loans. Japanese banks have been required since March 1998 to accumulate loan-loss provision to cover the reasonably expected default loss in accordance with the internal credit rating of each loan. The Japanese Financial Service Agency regularly examines whether banks appropriately classify loans and accumulate loan-loss provisions in accordance with the detailed criteria listed in the supervision guideline, ====, which was published in 1999 and revised several times since. The guideline indicates that inspectors from the agency conduct sample investigations of individual loans to assess the appropriateness of its credit rating and the assumptions in the calculation of loan-loss provisions. Thus, we can reasonably assume that the heterogeneity in loan-loss provisions caused by the discretion of individual banks does not significantly affect our analysis. A caveat on this measure is the reduced requirement for the provision for SME loans since November 2008 by the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Finance Facilitation Act and related measures. We control for this effect by introducing an interaction term with a dummy indicating this period and the ratio of small firms in each prefecture into our structural estimation.====Our findings are as follows. From our structural estimation in the first step, we find that lending competition, measured by the degree of competition, gets stronger as the liquidity ratio of banks increases with deepening monetary easing. The competition mode shifts from Cournot to perfect or Bertrand competition. We also find that competition tends to be stronger in markets where the loan demand elasticity is low, i.e., loan demand does not increase in response to a lower interest rate due to an aging demographic. From the regression analysis in the second step, we find evidence that banks in a more competitive market take more credit risks, which is measured by the loan-loss provision. Subsample regressions before and after the SME Financial Facilitation Act also consistently support the negative correlation between the degree of competition and risk taking. These findings are consistent with the search-for-yield theory.====The contribution of our study is threefold. First, our structural estimation provides up-to-date information about how the loan demand and supply functions respond to unprecedentedly massive and prolonged monetary easing and rapid population aging. These phenomena impose macroeconomic conditions totally different from those in the data windows for the existing structural estimations.====Second, we empirically clarify the positive association between the degree of lending competition and risk taking. The most popular measure of competition in the existing studies on the correlation between competition and risk taking (see Section 2.2.1 for detail) is the Lerner index. In theory, this index consists of the degree of competition and demand elasticity. We clarify that the former has the primary impact on bank risk taking by decomposing the Lerner index into these two components. This decomposition also shows an interesting impact of demand elasticity to the degree of competition, which has been ignored in the existing studies.====Third, we empirically show that the search-for-yield effect of monetary easing is more significant in a market where banks are more aggressive in lending competition after controlling for the loan demand elasticity. This finding is novel in the context of the empirical studies for the search-for-yield since the existing studies (such as Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, Saurina, 2014, Dell’Ariccia, Laeven, Suarez, 2017, among others. See Section 2.2.2 for more detail) focused on the impact of the indicator of monetary easing, such as the federal fund rate, to bank risk taking, rather than the difference in this impact by the degree of competition. We empirically verify another implication of the search-for-yield hypothesis that the impact differs by the degree of the penetration of lower funding costs to loan interest rates, which depends on the degree of competition.====Despite of these contributions, an important limitation of our test for the search-for-yield hypothesis is that we do not prove the causality from competition to risk taking, although we prove the positive correlation between them. The proof of the causality remains a future research subject.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We clarify our empirical questions, or hypotheses, based on an overview of the current Japanese regional loan market and the existing theories in Section 2. We introduce our structural model for estimation and the test strategy for the correlation between competition and risk taking in Section 3. We describe the dataset in Section 4. We summarize our findings from the structural estimation in Section 5 and the panel regression in Section 6.

This paper examines whether Japan's actual outward FDI stock is high or low relative to the FDI predicted by the gravity model using the outward FDI patterns of all OECD nations, which we call counterfactual FDI. The results indicate that the ratio of Japan's actual to counterfactual FDI is the highest among the OECD countries as of the year 2015. The regional distribution of Japan's actual to counterfactual FDI favors Southeast Asian nations, South Africa and the US. These results imply that Japan has no unrealized potential for outward FDI.","Politicians sometimes rally nationalistic support around the concept of “fairness” by asserting that other countries either under-perform or over-perform relative to some standard that they determine.==== While standards setting by policymakers is necessary for international agreements on mutual defense (e.g., the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO) or climate change (e.g., the Paris Agreement) so that each participating country has a target to meet, these results-based approaches have been rejected in favor of rules-based approaches in the arenas of international trade and investment under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Nevertheless, results-based approaches often are adopted by policymakers seeking public support and negotiating leverage so economists are often tasked with determining standards for distinguishing unusual trade and investment patterns. For example, many studies have addressed the accusations that Japan exports too much, imports too little, and hosts too little inward foreign direct investment (FDI).==== Most recently President Trump pressed Japanese business leaders to do more outward FDI, specifically into the US.==== This environment prompts our research question: Does Japan do enough outward FDI?====Japan's outward FDI has been expanding rapidly from the early 2000s. Fig. 1 indicates the value of Japanese outward FDI stock from 1996 to 2018. In 2018, Japanese outward FDI stock was historically high, reaching 181.7 trillion Japanese yen, which is about six times the level it was in 1996 (30.6 trillion yen). In 2014, the level of Japan's outward FDI stock was the 4th largest among the OECD countries.====Is Japan's outward FDI unusually high or low? This question is important from the home as well as the host countries’ viewpoints. From the home country's perspective, whether outward FDI accelerates or not can be a major concern for policy makers because it may result in the hollowing out of domestic industries, even though it is a rational choice for firms for their survival. On the other hand, from the host countries’ perspective, whether foreign firms expand their activities or not is an essential concern for the local economy.==== In particular, local economies often spend large amounts of public resources to attract FDI inflows with an expectation of positive economic returns.==== These issues involving FDI are not limited to Japan but are commonly observed in many advanced countries.====Questions regarding the appropriate size of FDI are nontrivial due to the many stakeholders involved in both home and host countries. In addition to policy incentives, FDI can be affected by both home and host countries’ factors such as economic size. Fig. 2 presents the ratio of outward FDI stock to GDP for Japan, the United States, and the average of the OECD countries from 1985 to 2015.==== Fig. 2 indicates that the ratio of outward FDI stock to GDP for Japan was 28.3 percent in 2015, which was comparable to the United States (27.6 percent) but lower than the OECD average of 44.5 percent. Fig. 2 also indicates that the ratios for Japan and the United States have been smaller than that for the average of the OECD countries for the last three decades between 1985 and 2015. This comparison implies that Japan's outward FDI may actually be somewhat low once one accounts for the size of the Japanese economy and the growth of other countries.====To evaluate whether Japanese outward FDI is unusually high or low, a reference value is necessary. Previous studies have established that the gravity model works well not only for international trade but also for FDI (e.g., Anderson, 2011).==== Accordingly, some studies such as Egger (2010) and Hoshi and Kiyota (2019) estimated counterfactual FDI, which is defined as the FDI predicted by the gravity model, and utilized it as the reference value. These studies then estimated the unexhausted FDI potential that is defined as the gap between the counterfactual and actual FDI stock. If the counterfactual FDI exceeds the actual FDI, this means that the gravity model predicts much larger FDI than the actual FDI. This in turn suggests that there is a potential for more FDI according to the gravity variables.====There are several studies such as Eaton and Tamura (1994) and Head and Ries (2005, 2008) that examined Japan's outward FDI in a gravity model framework. However, to the best of our knowledge, only Head and Ries (2005) addressed the above question directly.==== Head and Ries (2005) estimated the gravity model, using the data for 181 countries between 1980 and 2002. Their analysis found that Japan's actual outward FDI is ==== than the counterfactual FDI except for the period from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. While their study has important policy implications, their analysis did not cover the recent period when the Japanese outward FDI stock grew rapidly (Fig. 1).====Based on this background, this paper examines whether Japan's outward FDI still has untapped growth potential or not. To do so, we estimate a gravity model and compare Japan's actual outward FDI stock with the counterfactual FDI stock. In addition to covering a more recent period than the previous studies, our paper introduces a methodological improvement on the studies of Japanese outward FDI, many of which estimated a log linear form of the gravity model. A problem is that many country pairs have no FDI between them. Taking a log linear form implies that the analysis drops the country pairs with zero FDI. However, throwing away the observations with zero FDI results in inconsistent parameter estimates. To solve this problem, we employ the Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood estimator proposed by Santos Silva and Tenreyro, 2006. An additional contribution of our research is that we supplement our analysis of aggregate outward FDI stock with an examination of the regional distribution of Japan's actual versus counterfactual FDI stock.====Our results show that Japan's actual outward FDI exceeded its counterfactual FDI from 2013, and the ratio between the two is the highest among OECD countries as of 2015. The host countries with the highest actual-to-counterfactual ratios for Japanese FDI are Asian countries involved in Japanese supply chains (i.e., Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) but also include South Africa and the United States. Although President Trump recently pressed Japanese business leaders to invest more in the US, our research shows that the US hosted 1.7 times more Japanese FDI than the value predicted by the gravity model as of 2015. Our results imply that Japan has no unrealized potential for outward FDI at the aggregate level, nor at the country-level for the US in particular.====The paper is organized as follows.

We follow Borio et al.’s (2014, 2017) methodology, which takes into account the relationship between financial factors and the output gap. We find that the world's potential growth declined from an average of 3.0% in 2000–2007 to 2.6% in 2010–2018. Potential growth peaked before the crisis at 3.4% in 2006. The trough was in 2009 at 2.3%. Potential growth started recovering in 2010 and reached 2.9% in 2018. Decomposing the 0.4 percentage points decline between 2000–2007 and 2010–2018 by economy, we find that high-income Europe contributed 0.34 percentage points. The decline in potential growth in the United States contributed 0.24 percentage points, while the decline in Japan contributed just 0.07 percentage points. China's potential growth and that of Asia and the Pacific also fell, but their contributions to the change in the world's potential growth were positive, 0.33 percentage points and 0.11 percentage points, respectively. The other economies contributed 0.19 percentage points to the decline. Decomposing the sources of the decline into the contributions of labor force growth and labor productivity growth, the former declined by 0.55 percentage points, while labor productivity growth increased by 0.15 percentage points.","This paper provides estimates of potential growth for 52 economies for 2000–2018 and compares the two subperiods before and after the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008–2009, i.e., 2000–2007 and 2010–2018. Unlike most economic and financial crises of the past, the GFC began in advanced economies, with effects that were felt in the developing economies. The decline in actual GDP growth during and in the aftermath of the crisis, was evident across most economies around the world (Fig. 1). In 2009 (the bottom of the GFC), GDP contracted by 3.4% in high-income economies. In developing economies, the GFC led to weaker exports to advanced economies, thus lowering their overall GDP growth to 2.5% in 2009. Although actual growth picked up afterwards in both high-income and developing economies, average GDP growth for the world remains below that before the GFC (3.0% in 2010–2018 against 3.4% during 2000–2007). While actual growth trends for the world have been widely documented and analyzed, there is not much that we know about potential growth before and after the GFC.====Potential growth is the maximum sustainable limit by which an economy can grow in the long run, and the rate toward which actual growth tends. It provides a measure of the rate around which an economy will gravitate in the long run. While it is possible that an economy's actual growth diverges from its potential growth in the short run, in the long run actual growth cannot persistently diverge from the rate that is consistent with the full utilization of productive resources.====Formally introduced by Okun (1962), potential output is the level of output that is consistent with a level of employment that results in a non-accelerating rate of inflation. Borio et al. (2017) argue that equating potential output with non-inflationary output is too restrictive, since it neglects the role of financial factors. They add that it is possible for real output to grow in an unsustainable manner even under low and stable inflation, due to the role played by financial factors in the determination of long-term output. They find that information about the financial cycle explains a substantial portion of the cyclical movements in output.====Several studies have examined the association among financial cycles, business cycles, and financial crises, highlighting the procyclical relationship between financial factors and deviations of actual output from its potential. For example, Cecchetti and Kharroubi, 2015 showed that excessive expansion in the financial sector can negatively impact real output growth due to resource misallocation. Law and Singh (2014) found that the beneficial effect of finance on real output growth is only up to a certain threshold, beyond which it can crowd out output growth. On the idea that either financial underdevelopment or excessive expansion of finance can be bad for growth, Almarzoqi et al. (2015) used the notion of financial possibility frontier to produce benchmark values of financial development as predicted by structural fundamentals and to determine key policy variables affecting the gap between actual and benchmark values. They found that inflation, trade openness, institutional quality, and banking crises significantly affect financial development. Rousseau and Wachtel (2002) found that the impact of financial development on output growth interacts with the inflation rate, such that when inflation is above a particular threshold rate, financial factors no longer have a positive impact on real output growth. Claessens et al. (2011a) examined over 200 business cycles and 700 financial cycles in 44 economies during 1960–2007, and they noted that financial cycles tend to magnify the dynamics of real output throughout the course of the business cycle. In the case of Japan, Okimoto and Takaoka (2017) found that the term structure of credit spreads could help predict the country's business cycle. The foregoing suggests that apart from inflation, financial factors are also likely to have profound effects on output growth.====Given the empirical evidence about the influence of financial factors on real output, Borio et al. (2014, 2017) argue that financial cycles contain important information relevant to the estimation of the output gap and potential output; and that the information contained by financial factors can enhance the quality of the estimates. The ease of obtaining credit during periods of financial booms, for example, tends to relax supply-side constraints and leads to unsustainable increases in output without increasing price levels. Easy credit conditions also favor sectors that are most sensitive to credit, leading to unsustainable increases in output due to resource misallocation. The asset price inflation that accompanies financial booms also tends to encourage a surge in capital inflows and causes real exchange rate appreciation, which tempers imported price inflation. Taking into consideration the relationship between financial developments and economic activity leads to a measure of “finance-neutral” output gap.====Following the methodology of Borio et al. (2014, 2017), this paper estimates the output gap for 52 economies, and then derives estimates of potential output growth. We extend the analysis by aggregating potential growth for the world and by economic regions.====Our results show that the financial information that credit and property prices contain, help explain the cyclical part of output, i.e., the output gap. Adding information about the relationship between financial developments and the output gap, as in Borio et al. (2017) we observe that actual output was well above potential during the financial boom, before the GFC. In comparison, the standard Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter is not able to detect the unsustainable expansion in actual output before the crisis.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the framework to analyze the impact of financial factors on the output gap. Section 3 discusses the data and estimation results of the output gap and potential growth rate. Section 4 discusses the estimates of potential growth by economies and regions. Section 5 discusses the decomposition of potential growth into labor force growth and labor productivity growth.

A rapid decline in the labor force and a rising fiscal burden to ==== social security expenditures could hamper growth over a prolonged period. We build a dynamic general equilibrium model populated by overlapping generations of males and females who differ in participation rate, employment type and labor productivity as well as life expectancy. We study how changes in the labor market over the coming decades will affect the transition path of the economy and fiscal situation of Japan. We find that a rise in the labor supply of females and the elderly of both genders in an extensive margin and in labor productivity can significantly mitigate effects of demographic aging on the macroeconomy and reduce fiscal pressures, despite their negative effects on equilibrium wages during the transition. The study suggests that a combination of policies that remove obstacles hindering labor supply and that enhance a more efficient allocation of male and female workers of all age groups will be critical to keeping government deficit under control and raising income across the nation.","Japan is experiencing rapid and massive demographic aging. Despite the imminent urgency to deal with macroeconomic and fiscal concerns, how Japan is going to handle a dramatic shift in its demographic structure and rising expenditures remains to be seen.====In this paper, we build a general equilibrium model of overlapping generations of male and female individuals and quantify effects of demographic trends affecting the future path of individual behaviors, macroeconomic variables and fiscal situations in Japan.====The Japanese government is keen on encouraging labor force participation of females and nowadays also of the elderly. The employment rate for prime-age males is above 90% and there is not much room to further increase their participation. Females and the elderly are two groups of individuals whose participation is lower than that of prime-age males and who could contribute more, thereby slowing down the expected decline in aggregate labor supply and potentially improving the fiscal situation. What is unknown, however, is whether and how a rise in labor supply of females and the elderly by a given magnitude affects the Japanese economy including the transition path of output and factor prices as well as fiscal tensions associated with rising social security expenditures. Our focus is to quantify effects of changes in the labor supply, treated exogenously in the paper, of individuals of different genders, age as well as employment types and productivity.====We find that a rise in participation of females and the elderly, for example, as projected by the Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training (JILPT), could significantly mitigate a massive decline in the labor force and its consequences on macroeconomy expected during the coming decades. Quantitative effects, however, are most significant when not only labor force participation rates but also distribution of employment types as well as their productivity measured in terms of their wages also grow, for example, to the levels of males.====Many female workers in their late 20s and 30s leave the labor force when they marry and have children. A large number of them return to work after several years, yielding a so-called “M-shaped” profile of participation rates over the life-cycle. When they return, however, their employment types often differ from the ones prior to their departure and most of them are engaged in a contingent job rather than a regular job. The former typically pays significantly less than the latter. There also exists also a major gap between male and female wages even after controlling for age and employment type. Our study suggests that efforts to narrow the gap between males and females in the dimensions of participation rate, employment type and wage, would go far in making up for the decline in the labor force and filling the gap between rising government expenditures and shrinking revenues.====Although much focus in the policy discussion is on females and the elderly and this paper is not an exception, there are some concerning trends in the labor supply of males during recent years. Among prime-age working males, there has been a rise in the fraction of contingent workers across age groups from their 20s to 50s. The trend can be observed since the early 2000s at least, when a breakdown of employment types among workers became available from the Labor Force Survey (LFS). Similarly to females, contingent workers have much lower earnings compared to regular workers of the same gender. We find that aggregate labor supply, as well as capital and output, will be much lower and the fiscal burden in terms of tax rates needed to finance rising expenditures will be higher, if the trend of a rising share of contingent workers among males continues.====Our study is an extension of general equilibrium models of overlapping generations to study life-cycle allocations of individuals, in the tradition of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987). We follow literature that uses such models to study effects of cross-generational redistributional policies, such as De Nardi et al. (1999), Conesa and Krueger (1999), Nishiyama and Smetters (2007), and Kitao (2014). There are studies that use a life-cycle model to analyze effects of aging demographics and fiscal challenge in Japan, including Hansen and İmrohoroğlu (2016), Braun and Joines (2015), Kitao (2015), Hoshi and Ito (2014), Doi et al. (2011), Okamoto (2013).====These papers abstract from differences between males and females and assume life-cycle profiles of wages and demographics of either males or an average of the two groups. The two, however, have very different profiles of labor market experience over their life-cycle as mentioned above. Work by İmrohoroğlu, Kitao, Yamada, 2016, İmrohoroğlu, Kitao, Yamada, 2019 presents a generational accounting model with details of employment types of males and females, as well as institutional structures of the Japanese social security system. The studies, however, assume partial equilibrium and differ from ours in that we explicitly incorporate production and endogenous determination of factor prices driven by the ongoing demographic aging.====This paper, however, does not present a model to investigate why gender gaps in terms of labor market experience of males and females exist, or why females are sorted to particular employment types initially and also later in their life-cycle. While these are important issues, this paper’s focus is to quantify the effects of exogenous changes in the pattern of labor supply, extrapolating the trend in several possible ways, on the future path of the macroeconomy, factor prices and fiscal situations. We aim to identify factors that are critical in projections of these variables in a general equilibrium framework of males and females.====Papers such as Attanasio et al. (2008), Blundell et al. (2016) build a model with endogenous female labor supply and study their life-cycle behavior, taking into account gender heterogeneity within families. Recent work by Blundell et al. (2019) extends these models and estimates a structural life-cycle model to evaluate roles of formal training and experience for females in mitigating the wage gap between men and women. They show that effects of training can be important especially for women who have fewer years of education. Lise and Yamada (2018) estimate a structural model of intra-family allocations of consumption and time used for leisure, home production and market work, using a unique panel dataset of Japanese households. Extending the current paper in such a direction in the context of the Japanese economy and over a long time-horizon will be a challenging but promising direction of future work.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present the model in Section 2. Details of the calibration and data sets used are given in Section 3. The benchmark results and various sensitivity analyses are discussed in Section 4.

Adopting spatial panel methods, this study found in the main that net factor flows of debt, equity and Foreign Direct Investment ==== have all contributed favourably to consumption risk sharing during these episodes, with Foreign Direct Investment retained earnings robust in its positive contribution in buffering shocks to consumption. These results suggest that one of the alleged benefits of financial integration in terms of providing the insurance needed to cushion the economy against adverse shocks is tangible and real at least in the context of Korea. We also obtain evidence that apart from asset channels, the combination of the government's social transfer payments and a certain measure of labour mobility help to contribute in mitigating shocks to consumption.","One of the key purported benefits of financial openness is that it offers residents of countries a larger pool of resources or assets that they can hold and diversify across asset classes. Because these foreign assets (holdings of debt, equities and FDI) are intimately linked to the volatility of output abroad, and thus, are less susceptible to domestic or local output shocks, residents are then provided the opportunity to “smooth out” changes in their consumption resulting from fluctuations in domestic output. We would then expect that greater financial openness offers more diversification opportunities for residents of countries and as such, lead to increased risk sharing.====Recent evidence has shown that greater financial openness leads to increased risk sharing only for developed economies (Artis and Hoffmann, 2008; Kose et al., 2009).==== As argued by Balli et al. (2013), however, these studies covered the period that relate to an era of financial upturn. For instance, Kose et al. (2009) referred to their sample period of 1987 to 2004 as the modern era of globalization. In that regard, we know little of how risk sharing performs during times of financial downturn or turmoil. One possible indication on how risk sharing can play out during a crisis is the observation that during the Global Financial Crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, given that many countries were affected by these two crises, imply that the risk was shared, although the degree of risk sharing was imperfect as some countries were stricken more by the crises than others (Mendoza and Quadrini, 2010).====A later study by Balli et al. (2013) provided formal evidence on this issue. They examined how international risk sharing performed during the Global Financial Crisis for a set of advanced economies as well as looked at the relative contribution of the receipts and payments of net factor income flows (debt, equity and FDI reinvested earnings) on consumption risk sharing during this same period. They found that the financial crisis contributed only to a slight drop in consumption risk sharing in the countries comprising the European monetary union (EMU) and OECD countries. They also found that net factor income flows from debt assets delivered better risk sharing than equity in the case of the OECD than in the European monetary union, while FDI supported consumption only in the OECD during the crisis.====Our paper contends with these same two issues on how consumption risk sharing fared during crises times, particularly, during the Global Financial Crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, as well as the issue of the relative contribution of these three asset classes (debt, equity and FDI reinvested earnings) on consumption risk sharing during these crises. However, the paper's key contribution is on the examination of these issues from a national risk sharing perspective by utilizing data on provincial and metropolitan cities. Previous studies that investigated both issues from the angle of national risk sharing, especially the second one, is non-existent. Earlier empirical research on national consumption risk sharing has concentrated in general on the degree of consumption risk sharing using much earlier data for US states and Canadian provinces (Asdrubali et al., 1996; Crucini, 1999; Crucini and Hess, 2001; Athanasouli and van Wincoop, 2001).====The lack of publicly available regional data on net factor income flows disaggregated across the three asset classes of debt, equity and FDI reinvested earnings is the most likely reason for this dearth of studies, particularly, on the second issue. For this paper, in addition to publicly available data on regional consumption and GDP, we exploit available annual regional data on net factor income flows disaggregated across the three asset classes in the case of Korea.==== Specifically, the data is available for the entire 16 Korean provinces and metropolitan cities (henceforth provinces). Korea offers as an interesting case. After being one of the East Asian country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Korea did not reverse course and continue on a path of a gradual and systematic liberalization of capital flows initially announced in 1998 (IMF, 2012). From 2005 to 2007, locally owned Korean banks and the branches of foreign banks in Korea experienced rapid inflows in the form of short-term liabilities. The country was at the sharp end of the financial turmoil after the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and again during the European sovereign debt crisis when it experienced substantial capital outflows (Bruno and Shin, 2014; BOK, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015).====One other innovation that we introduce in this study is that we employ the technique of spatial econometrics to analyse the issues with direct relevance to consumption risk sharing. To the best of our knowledge, while this technique has been applied to various economics and financial issues, this the first time that this method is being applied for the issue of consumption risk sharing.==== It is becoming a standard nowadays that when dealing with regional or provincial data, a spatial approach needs to be considered. Perhaps, the most important argument for considering a spatial approach is that the independence assumption between observations is no longer valid. Provinces or regions that are located much closer to each other within a nation are more related than distant ones such that externalities or neighbourhood effects need to be considered using spatial variables such as distance. Conventional regression models assume that observations are independent of one another and as such, fail to take account of this dependence between observations. This can lead to estimation results that are biased.====The main findings of this paper are as follows: first, similar to earlier estimates of national consumption risk sharing in other advanced countries, the degree of consumption risk sharing in Korea is also imperfect with estimates that range from 47 per cent to 61 per cent, although relatively lower compared to earlier estimates obtained for US states and Canadian provinces. Second, net factor income flows of debt, equity and FDI retained earnings have all contributed favourably to consumption risk sharing during major episodes of high global economic volatility (i.e., Global Financial Crisis and the eurozone crisis) with FDI retained earnings robustly positive in contributing to consumption risk sharing in Korea during these turbulent periods. Third, we also obtain evidence in one of our robustness checks that closer to the period of the intense volatility in international financial markets, not only the overall degree of consumption risk sharing increased, but the net contributions of the three asset classes to consumption smoothing in Korea likewise increased. Finally, we also obtain evidence that not only asset channels, but also the combination of the government's social transfer payments and a certain measure of labour mobility helped to contribute in mitigating shocks to consumption.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The findings clearly support the mutual gains hypothesis. The results also indicate that in fostering employee trust, management plays a supportive role in enabling unions to verify its claims by disclosing high-quality information, whereas unions play an important role in mitigating ====.","The economics literature is increasingly recognizing the role of “trust”―defined as a “firm belief in the reliability, truth or ability of someone or something” (Oxford English Dictionary, 2019) ―in the economy; however, its role within firms remains insufficiently examined. Social trust is believed to hasten financial development and economic growth by decreasing transaction costs, uncertainty, and information asymmetries, while increasing efficiency and facilitating cooperation and coordination (Knack and Keefer, 1997; La Porta et al., 1997). There are also some studies that explore the effects of specific workplace practices on employee trust. Mayer and Davis (1999) find that the introduction of a new performance appraisal system that is more acceptable to the employees than the previous system increases trust toward top management. Blunsdon and Reed (2003), using the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, find that trust is higher if the management devotes some time to corporate ethics and lower if policies and procedures are formalized. Grund and Harbring (2009) find that some indicators of control at the workplace, such as strict working time regulations, monitoring and lack of autonomy, are negatively related to trust. These studies lack investigations of the effects of workplace trust on the success of workplace innovations or the relationship between workplace trust and mutual gains, particularly benefits to employees.====The following two arguments on workplace innovation emphasize the importance of workplace trust for establishing productivity-enhancing work practices. Trust in the workplace seems to contribute significantly to a successful High Performance Work System (HPWS). The work practices aim to facilitate employees’ discretionary efforts to enhance productivity through employee-employer cooperation, employee involvement in decision-making, and employee participation in financial matters (Ichniowski et al., 1997). However, employees that fear job loss due to technological changes might be unwilling to share information that could facilitate productive innovations at their workplaces and resist investing in firm-specific skills. Employers should credibly commit to considering employees’ interests to elicit their efforts and cooperation. Worker representation theory often emphasizes the importance of trust in workplace innovations. According to Freeman and Lazear (1995), the works council, which is the prominent example of nonunion employee representation in European countries, is a mechanism that improves information flow between workers and management and fosters the trust necessary to establish productivity-enhancing work practices. The theories of HPWS and works councils are based on Kochan and Osterman's (1994) idea that employers and employees can obtain mutual gains in a prevailing climate of trust. Freeman and Lazear (1995) focused on the role of works councils, which can be easily extended to HPWS (Black and Lynch, 2004).====The concept of HPWSs was widely disseminated and firmly established in the post-World War II Japanese economy, particularly in the manufacturing industry (Kato and Morishima, 2002). Based on the two arguments mentioned, the prevalence of HPWSs is considered the result of management efforts to gain the trust of employees, a key element in eliciting their discretionary productivity-enhancing effort. The representative form of labor-management relations in large Japanese firms is a Joint Labor-Management Committee (JLMC), which enables the enterprise unions within companies and management to develop trusting industrial relationships (Kato and Morishima, 2002). JLMCs build such relationships by improving information flows between the union and management, deepening labor-management consultations, and encouraging union participation in decision-making, which is expected to affect employees significantly. As Kato and Morishima (2002) confirm, the positive effects of Japanese JLMCs on productivity indicate that they are an important factor in the successful implementation of HPWSs in the modern Japanese economy. Hence, it is a strong possibility that employee trust in management generated through JLMCs increases their discretionary productivity-enhancing efforts and their sense of job security.====To affirm the importance of employee trust in management in workplace innovations, it is important to clarify the role of trust in management in eliciting employees’ productivity-enhancing efforts and increasing sense of job security in Japan where the HPWSs became more common. Such clarification may also reveal an important clue to the success of HPWSs as well as in other countries.====Previous studies have paid little attention to the mutual efforts of enterprise unions and management to foster among employees a level of trust in management that provides employees with a strong sense of job security and makes them willing to engage in productivity-enhancing efforts. Japanese JLMCs operate in a manner similar to German works councils (Rodgers and Streeck, 1995) in terms of increasing productivity by fostering employer–employee trust.==== Unlike German works councils, however, Japanese JLMCs are not legally mandated (they have neither the right to information nor co-determination rights); they are voluntarily operated, and it seems to be more difficult for labor and management to build trustful and cooperative relationships through JLMCs than at works councils. This current study pays particular attention to the roles of unions and management in fostering employee trust in management to ensure the efficient operation of HPWSs.====This study analyzes whether employee trust in management results in mutual gains—productivity-enhancing efforts of employees for management, and a sense of job security for employees—in the Japanese automobile industry. Furthermore, this study investigates how enterprise unions and management develop employee trust in management. Firms in the Japanese automobile industry, which is one of the Japan's leading industries, have strong global competitiveness. Hence, verifying that employee trust in management plays a major role in eliciting employees’ efforts in globally competitive firms implies that trust is a crucial element in the success of HPWSs that enhance corporate productivity.

To explain the patterns, we build a dynamic model and examine the role of barriers to technology adoption. We find that such barriers hampered catch-up in the prewar period and explain about one-third of the postwar miracle. Taking a historical perspective, we argue that factors that acted as the barriers include low capacity to absorb technology, economic and political frictions with the outside world, and a lack of sufficient competition.","Japan’s modern economic growth began around the end of the 19th century after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Yet, despite modernization, Japan’s per capita output in the pre-World-War-II period remained at only around 40 percent of that of the United Kingdom, one of the leading economies at that time, as shown in Fig. 1(a). It was only in the 1950s – about half a century after modernization began – that Japan’s per capita output started catching up with the UK. This raises the question why catch-up did not take place during the prewar period. What factors prevented catch-up from materializing? And why did Japan suddenly experience a growth miracle in the postwar period?====To address these questions, we focus on barriers to technology adoption and examine its role in Japanese prewar and postwar economic growth. Specifically, we hypothesize that barriers to technology adoption hampered economic growth during the prewar period and that the reduction of such barriers after the war contributed to the growth miracle. Following the convention in the literature, we use the term ‘barriers’ in the sense that such barriers do not necessarily block technology adoption completely but make it more costly and difficult than otherwise would be the case.====We formulate our hypothesis regarding technology adoption based on three observations. First, as shown by growth accounting studies such as Hayami and Ogasawara (1999) and calibration studies such as Otsu (2009) and Esteban-Pretel and Sawada (2014), Japan’s growth miracle was driven by rapid technological progress as indicated by strong total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Second, as will be discussed in detail in this paper, data on technology adoption suggest that the number of contracts of technology adoption was much lower in the prewar period than in the postwar period. Third, in the literature on Japan’s economic history (e.g., Peck and Tamura, 1976), the country during the immediate postwar era is regarded as an outstanding example of purposeful national effort to apply technology to achieve economic growth.====Among the various types of technology that may potentially have been affected by barriers to technology adoption, this study focuses on investment-specific technology (IST). In the 20th century, during both the prewar and the postwar periods, Japanese technology importation focused mainly on capital-formation-embodying technologies – those embodied in capital goods such as machinery and equipment.==== In addition, consistent with the hypothesis on barriers to technology adoption, the relative price of investment – one measure of IST progress==== – in Japan was much higher than in the UK during the prewar period, but started decreasing and converging to that in the UK in the postwar period. Developments in the ratio of the relative price of investment for Japan to that for the UK – which provides a measure of IST progress in Japan relative to the UK – shown in Fig. 1(b) suggest that Japan was much less developed than the UK in terms of IST in the prewar period but caught up with and overtook the UK in the postwar period. Moreover, the advances in IST may explain the aforementioned high TFP growth in the postwar period if growth accounting does not take IST progress into account separately and thereby TFP calculated from such growth accounting includes IST.====We examine the hypothesis on barriers to technology adoption by building a two-sector dynamic model featuring endogenous adoption of IST as well as barriers to IST adoption. The model economy is essentially a closed economy except that it faces the world technology frontier. This modeling reflects the fact that it was technology adoption mainly through licenses that contributed to the high growth in the manufacturing sector in the early post-WWII period (Aoki et al., 2010), but not necessarily an increase in the volume of trades, as the ratio of imports to output was lower in the period than in the prewar period.====The model provides a close link between the extent of such barriers and the ratio of the relative price of investment for Japan to that for the UK. This link allows us to quantify the extent of such barriers by using data on the relative price of investment. Simulation results using the model show that the reduction of IST adoption barriers explains about one-third of the catch-up attained in the postwar period. If such a decline in barriers had occurred in the prewar period, the gap in per capita output between Japan and the UK would have been narrowed by the same margin. Thus, IST adoption barriers explain about one-third of the gap in per capita output in the prewar period.====In addition, the model explains the decrease in the ratio of the relative price of investment observed around the period 1950–1980 shown in Fig. 1(b). The model features costly technology adoption so that it takes time to adopt new technology even after barriers to technology adoption were reduced. This costly technology adoption plays a critical role in replicating the developments in the ratio of the relative price of investment.====In the model, the barriers to technology adoption make it costly and difficult to adopt new technology. However, what form did such barriers to technology adoption take in practice? From a historical perspective we argue that the barriers had to do with low capacity to absorb new technologies, economic and political frictions between Japan and other countries, and a lack of sufficient competition in the domestic market.====In the prewar period, capacity to absorb and make use of advanced technology was likely much lower than in the postwar period. In fact, the spread of modern science was slow, and the early industrialization of Japan was characterized by the traditional “textiles first” pattern.==== Also, the number of experts with an engineering major was low,==== which must have been one obstacle for the development of heavy industries. During WWII, government efforts contributed to the increase in absorptive capacity by concentrating resources, including labor, in heavy industries and by increasing the number of engineers. This increased capacity, however, was used exclusively for the purpose of war-related production. Relatedly, another factor acting as a barrier in the prewar period was economic and political frictions between Japan and other countries, culminating in a series of wars and military incidents from 1931 onward, which likely blocked technology adoption from abroad. Moreover, the market environment in the prewar period was considerably less competitive than in the postwar period due, partly, to the presence of the ==== (family-controlled conglomerates). The ==== controlled a great part of the economy,==== but their conservative business stance discouraged the entry of new firms, investment, and adoption of new technologies.==== These factors made it costly and difficult to adopt new technology from abroad in the prewar period, but they were mitigated dramatically in the postwar period,==== and thus can be seen as factors underlying the barriers assumed in the model.====This study contributes to the literature on Japan’s prewar growth and postwar miracle. In particular, the study is motivated by Hayashi and Prescott (2008) argument that barriers to labor mobility between agriculture and the manufacturing sector explain about one-fourth of the gap in per capita output between Japan and the United States in the prewar period. Relatedly, Esteban-Pretel and Sawada (2014) argue that while the removal of barriers to labor mobility was one of major contributors to Japan’s postwar growth, it is the high growth of non-agricultural TFP that drove the growth miracle. Braun et al. (2008) find that developments in Japan’s TFP are linked to prior trends in research and development (R&D) expenditure in the US, suggesting that technology adoption contributed to the growth miracle. Meanwhile, Aoki et al. (2010) argue that during the early postwar period Japan’s non-agricultural TFP growth was mainly driven by the import of foreign technology via licensing. The present study complements these studies by focusing on barriers to the adoption of IST and explaining developments in TFP that are driven by IST progress.====The idea that Japan’s growth miracle can in part be explained by a reduction in barriers to technology adoption is not new. Employing a neoclassical growth model and focusing on TFP, Parente, Prescott, 1994, Parente, Prescott, 2000, for example, argue that Japan’s postwar growth dynamics can be explained by a reduction in barriers to technology adoption. Relatedly, using a two-period overlapping generations model, Ngai (2004) shows that the declines in barriers to capital accumulation in the late 19th century and in the postwar period contribute to Japanese economic growth since 1820. Finally, Comin and Hobijn (2011) show empirically that economic aid and technical assistance provided by the US in the postwar period contributed to a reduction in technology-adoption costs in Japan.====This paper differs from these preceding studies in at least three important respects. First, unlike Parente, Prescott, 1994, Parente, Prescott, 2000, this study focuses on IST and quantifies the barriers to technology adoption from data on the relative price of investment. Second, unlike Ngai (2004) in which the process of technology adoption is not specified, this paper presents a model that endogenizes technology adoption and shows that the increase in technology adoption as a result of the reduction in barriers to technology adoption explains postwar developments in the relative price of investment. It then quantifies the effect of these barriers on Japan’s economic growth in the prewar and postwar periods. Third, the study complements the model-based results with historical evidence regarding barriers to technology adoption.====The remainder of the study proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents our dynamic model featuring endogenous technology adoption that we employ for our analysis. Section 3 quantifies barriers to technology adoption, simulates the model, and presents the main result of our analysis. Section 4 then takes a historical perspective and discusses factors that potentially created such barriers.

While Fukuda (2015) identifies changes in foreign investors’ expectations from ==== changes in financial markets, we focus on changes in the ==== demanded of Japanese stocks. We obtain three findings. First, only foreign investors aggressively and immediately purchased Japanese stocks at the onset of Abenomics. Second, since the two years following the launch of Abenomics, foreign investment inflows into Japanese stocks have changed due to external factors originating in the United States. Third, a VAR analysis shows the heterogeneous impacts of Abenomics among investors inside and outside Japan. However, the changes in foreign investors’ expectations are short-lived in the sense that signs of permanent shifts as a result of Abenomics cannot be identified after 2014.","The only effective way for policy makers to stimulate aggregate demand under ==== is to drastically change market expectations. However, limited knowledge exists on how to induce changes in public expectations. As Fujiwara et al. (2015) notes, the conventional wisdom of macroeconomics is that policy regime change can change a sluggish economic situation by managing expectations ==== Eggertsson and Woodford (2003). Although the proposition that expectation matters is widely accepted, we do not necessarily have a comprehensive understanding of whether and how policy makers could drastically influence public expectations concerning economies’ fundamentals.====To investigate whether Abenomics is successful in the sense that it can cause an abrupt change in expectations, we re-examine whether there have been impacts on domestic and foreign investors in the Japanese stock markets during Abenomics by analyzing the quantity demanded of Japanese stocks rather than price data. The past studies that conduct policy evaluations use asset prices or forecast data to detect structural changes. For example, Fukuda (2015) identifies changes in foreign investors’ expectations by ==== changes in financial markets.==== Instead of using price data, we focus on the change in the ==== demanded of Japanese stocks because we believe that the investment amount from domestic and foreign investors indicates the expectation changes among these investment groups more directly than the price movements in different time zones.====There are three findings in this paper. First, we find that only foreign investors are statistically aggressive in purchasing Japanese stocks and immediately respond to the onset of Abenomics. We find that the flow from foreign investors into Japanese stocks structurally changed immediately after the start of Abenomics, but no such changes occurred for domestic investors in the corresponding period. Second, two years after the onset of Abenomics, the changes in flows into Japanese stock markets reflect external factors from the United States rather than domestic factors. We detect structural breaks in foreign flows on the dates when major events occurred in the United States. Third, a VAR analysis shows that the impact of Abenomics on investors’ flows is only transitory: there is no permanent effect. Our estimation results suggest that the underlying trends of stagnated and stable returns from Japanese stocks during the day and night, which we have experienced over the last three decades, changed slightly for two years when Abenomics was first introduced. In fact, the upward trend of stock returns at night accelerates, and the tendency of sluggish returns during the day is mitigated in the first two years of Abenomics. However, the changes in expectations are short-lived in the sense that the sign of a permanent shift in market expectations, which is seen just after the beginning of Abenomics, vanishes after 2014.====This study examines whether Abenomics policy packages can change market expectations for policy evaluation. Specifically, we examine (1) who purchases Japanese stocks in response to Abenomics? (2) What causes changes in investment flows into the Japanese stock markets? (3) After the first two years of Abenomics, did the “bullish” expectations for Abenomics explain the subsequent rise in returns of Japanese stocks? Most previous studies on transmission mechanisms focus on monetary policy. While the large-scale quantitative easing of monetary policy constitutes the main component of Abenomics, other policies, such as fiscal expansion and growth strategies, are also included in policy packages. This paper focuses on the effects of the general policy packages on the Japanese financial markets. Additionally, instead of tracking potential transmission channels, we concentrate our attention on a well-known fact; that is, initial policies largely influence some financial measures, such as the stock price index and the exchange rate, while they seem to have a minimal influence on the real economy.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic features of Abenomics and discusses some related previous studies. Section 3 discusses the flow data used in our study. Section 4 investigates who purchases Japanese stocks and what events affect investment flows into Japan. Section 5 examines whether two years after the start of Abenomics, the policy packages had a persistent effect on the Japanese stock markets, and Section 6 concludes.",Heterogeneous impacts of Abenomics on the stock market: A Fund flow analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158319300449,12 November 2019,2019,Research Article,95.0

We focus on the human capital stock of municipalities, measured by the share of university graduates in the municipal population, and human capital related variable, identified as a shortage rate of nursery school capacity. Our results reveal the migration pattern from municipalities with low to high human capital stock or to better conditions. Moreover, the positive impact of human capital stock is larger for age groups active in the labor force. We discuss the implications of our empirical findings for sustainable regional development in aging societies with declining populations.","According to Tiebout (1956), people can convey their preferences regarding municipal policies or government services by “foot voting” or leaving a municipality and moving into another municipality with satisfactory government services. Along with government services, socio-economic factors have a major impact on residents’ preferences, and changes in these factors have an impact on migration patterns. Without substantial financial or legal restrictions, people who migrate to preferred areas in a country are less likely to encounter known migration barriers compared with those who migrate to other areas. In developed countries with large middle classes, which are not as affected by migration barriers, the impact of such preferences will likely be more pronounced than in other contexts.====This study combines municipal-level migration and demographic data including economic conditions, government support, and geographic information. In Japan, migration patterns reveal that a few major metropolitan areas have high net population inflows and that smaller municipalities in non-metropolitan areas experience net population outflows. In fact, 40 of 47 prefectures experienced negative net population inflows in 2014 (see Fig. 1). We also observe that in most prefectures, more than 40 percent of the migrants are of the younger generation. Specifically, people in the 20–29 age group tend to migrate more than other age groups (see Fig. 2). Additionally, 75 percent of municipalities experienced population declines in 2014, and the number rises to approximately 80 percent if we specify the net population inflow of the people aged 20–29. Fig. 1 implies that the population outflow of younger residents from non-metropolitan areas presumably has accelerated the aging of communities in these depopulating areas.====Studying migration patterns is important because the excess population outflow from non-metropolitan areas to metropolitan areas may have a negative impact on people’s living conditions and economic activities in depopulating areas. Additionally, depopulation leads to a decrease in the demand for goods and services, possibly resulting in the exit of service providers from those areas. Depopulation may also lead to job market contraction and reduce job opportunities in the affected areas, which may result in increasing unemployment and the further outflow of labor to metropolitan areas, where migrants expect to find better economic prospects. The outflow of labor has other economic consequences, such as declines in local tax revenues, which may negatively affect the quality of government services, potentially leading to further depopulation.====In addition, the excessive inflow to metropolitan areas affects people’s living environments and introduces major policy challenges for the receiving areas. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIAC) (2014) noted that excessive inflow to metropolitan areas, particularly Tokyo, could cause problems such as increased vulnerability to large-scale disasters, high land and housing prices, congestion on roads and in public transportation, and shortages of medical care centers, nursing homes, and child care centers.====Understanding migration patterns and people’s placement preferences is an important foundation for resolving migration-related issues. In this paper, we focus on examining the impacts of human capital stock and human capital-related variables on population inflow. Studying a sample of university graduates, we examine whether the difference in human capital stock explains internal migration patterns in Japan. We also include extensive explanatory variables that may affect migration decisions, including policies of the destination municipalities. Applying the modified gravity model used in Andrienko and Guriev (2004), our results show that the abovementioned factors explain the migration patterns in Japan and reflect people’s preferences regarding where they want to live. Based on our empirical results regarding these migration factors, we further discuss possible policy implications and measures that may support these efforts.",Migration and human capital: Evidence from japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158318300443,5 November 2019,2019,Research Article,100.0

Since legal restrictions hinder short selling, the subsequent underperformance of highly shorted stocks is hypothesized to be more pronounced during periods when these regulations are stronger. On the basis of actual rules on short sales, the period from January 2012 to October 2013 is defined as a high regulation period and the period from November 2013 to July 2016 is defined as a low regulation period. Using all stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the JASDAQ Securities Exchange, this research finds evidence that short sales constrained stocks are generally overvalued but also that the subsequent underperformance of maximally shorted stocks compared to minimally shorted stocks does not differ significantly across regulatory regimes. This study concludes that the underperformance of short sales constrained stocks is linked to market-oriented restrictions such as the inability to borrow stock to sell short. Legal restrictions on short sales do not appear to create additional distortions in stock prices.","Short selling has long been an area of regulatory concern because of fears that it will destabilize markets. As a result, restrictions on short selling are common in many countries; these restrictions tend to become binding during crisis periods. Theories on short selling argue that stocks become overpriced when regulations impede the impact of information on prices (Miller, 1977). As a result, short sales constrained stocks become overpriced and are expected to underperform subsequently. Harrison and Kreps (1978) also argue that short sales constraints can push securities prices above the valuation of the most optimistic investors, leading to subsequent underperformance. The rational expectation model of Diamond and Verrecchia (1987) postulates that bad news requires more time than good news to be reflected in stock prices under short sales constraints. Since short sales constraints limit trading by some informed traders, the speed of adjustment to bad news is expected to be slower. However, price declines sharply when such information is made public. According to the rational expectations model of Diamond and Verrecchia (1987), stocks with heavy demand for short sales are also expected to underperform subsequently.====Several studies provide evidence that short sales constrained stocks as measured by their high short interest ratios underperform subsequently (Asquith, Pathak, and Ritter, 2005; Asquith and Meulbroek, 1995; and Desai, Ramesh, Thiagarajan, and Balachandran, 2002). Blocher, Reed and Van Wesep (2013) and Boehme, Danielsen and Sorescu (2006) find that short sales constrained stocks not only produce lower future returns but also perform more poorly when investor divergence of opinion is high. Ackert and Athanassakos (2005), Au, Doukas and Onayev (2009), Mohamad, Jaafar, Hodgkinson and Wells (2013), Gopalan (2003), Aitken, Frino, McCorry and Swan (1998), Angel, Christophe and Ferri (2003), and Rapach, Ringgenberg and Zhou (2016) provide international evidence on the subsequent underperformance of stocks with high demand for short sales. Two studies document underperformance and slow adjustment speed for short sales constrained stocks in Japan as well. Isaka (2007) showed that short sales constraints slow the speed of adjustment of stock prices to negative information. Takahashi (2010) finds that minimally shorted stocks outperformed maximally shorted stocks for up to three months after forming portfolios based on short sales. However, the evidence on the subsequent underperformance of stocks is not unanimous as some other studies did not find supporting evidence (Khan, Bremer, and Kato, 2018; Lee and Ko, 2014; Beber and Pagano, 2013; Kaplan, Moskowitz, and Sensoy, 2013; Ko and Lim, 2006; Woolridge and Dickinson, 1994; Figlewski and Webb, 1993; Brent, Morse and Stice, 1990).====How short selling regulations affect stock prices, liquidity, volatility and trading volume has been a concern to regulators as well as academics especially after a new wave of short sales restrictions was imposed across the world following the financial crisis of 2008. Although restrictions on short selling are motivated by the fear that it exaggerates market falls, previous studies did not find evidence that short selling actually increased volatility, the level of skewness or the probability of market crashes (Bailey and Zheng, 2013; Saffi and Sigurdsson, 2011; Charoenrook and Daouk, 2009). Restrictions on short selling are rather found to reduce liquidity and slow the price discovery process (Beber and Pagano, 2013; Kolasinski, Reed, and Thornock, 2012; Marsh and Payne, 2012; Bris, Goetzmann, and Zhu, 2007). Several other studies also provide evidence on how restrictions on short selling affect trading activities. Grullon, Michenaud and Weston (2015) found that relaxation of the uptick rule in the United States (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2010) increased short selling activity. Jain, Jain, McInish and McKenzie (2013) found that short selling restrictions reduced short selling in a firm's home country as well as in other countries where the firm's securities were traded. Although the liquidity impact of restrictions on short selling is well documented, evidence on its price impact is not unanimous. Boehmer, Jones and Zhang (2013) provided evidence that stock prices were unaffected. Battalio, Mehran and Schultz (2012) also did not find concrete evidence on the effect of short sales bans on stock prices. Do, Do and Chai (2012) found that a worldwide ban on short selling did not impede the law of one price.====There are two distinct sources of restrictions on short sales: market-oriented restrictions and regulatory restrictions. The market-oriented restriction on short sales emerges from the demand and supply of loanable stocks and can be proxied by the high short interest ratio, low institutional ownership or a combination of the two, whereas regulatory restrictions emerge from rules that limit short selling such as a ban on short sales, restrictions on uncovered short sales and price movement regulations. The existing literature has examined these issues separately, leaving the combined effect of both restrictions as a still unexplored area. There are several studies that document the price effects of market-oriented and regulatory restrictions on short sales. Regulatory restrictions are generally imposed in addition to market-orientated restrictions. Thus, it remains an important question whether regulatory restrictions actually have marginal effects on prices.====Japan is a country where there is widespread support for artificial intervention in the market (Osaki, 2013). As in most countries, the common opinion toward short sales in Japan is not positive. There were controversies surrounding short sales of IPO stocks and price distortions during the financial crisis of 2008 (Uchida and Iwasaki, 2013; and Osaki, 2013). The financial crisis and several incidents of manipulation motivated Japanese authorities to impose restrictions on short sales. Although restrictions on short sales were initially implemented as an emergency measure, these regulations were continually renewed. Major short selling regulations such as the uptick rule, prohibitions on uncovered short selling and coverage of short sales by IPO stocks continued to be strengthened until October 2013. Finally, short sales were made investor-friendly by relaxing most price movement regulations in October 2013. Short sellers are now allowed to trade at any price unless the stock falls by more than ten percent from the previous closing price. As a result, the relaxation of price movement limits should reduce short sales constraints compared to the earlier highly regulated period. However, the marginal effects of the imposition and relaxation of regulations on short selling have been little studied in Japan.====By using the short interest ratio as a measure of short sales constraints, this study examines the impact of short sales related regulation on the subsequent return behavior of short sales constrained stocks in Japan. The rational expectations model of Diamond and Verrecchia (1987) hypothesizes that legal restrictions on short sales make stocks overvalued. This research uses the almost “natural” experiment of changing regulatory regimes in Japan to test their hypothesis.==== It examines whether legal restrictions contribute to greater overvaluation and subsequent underperformance of short sales constrained stocks. The January 2012–October 2013 period is defined as the high regulation period because regulations on short selling were most binding during this time. Since November 2013 regulations on short sales have eased because of the relaxation of the uptick rule. Since there were no major changes in other forms of regulation in both periods, this study is a test of the effect of relaxing price movement regulations on the return behavior of short sales constrained stocks. Although there are several studies documenting the return behavior of short sales constrained stocks, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to examine whether price regulations actually have an impact on the subsequent behavior of returns in addition to what is created by the market-oriented short sales constraints. This study fills a gap in the existing literature on the combined effects of market-oriented and regulatory restrictions on short sales. Moreover, as was discussed above, previous studies provide unanimous evidence of the liquidity effect of short sales restrictions but the effect of restrictions on the behavior of stock prices is still unclear. Therefore, understanding the price effects of restrictions on short selling in one of the largest stock markets in the world is important.====This paper is organized as follows.

This paper reports that the yen appreciation between 2007 and 2011 reduced yen ep&c export prices by 28%. The results also indicate that yen appreciations led to small declines in ep&c export volumes and, together with NT dollar depreciations, to large decreases in Japanese semiconductor stock prices. The strong yen caused yen export prices during and after the GFC to tumble relative to yen production costs, decimating profits. Plummeting profits in turn hindered Japanese ep&c firms from investing enough in capital and innovation to compete with nimble rivals.","Japan is upstream in global value chains and exports parts and components and capital goods to downstream producers. In every year since 1994 electronic parts and components (ep&c) has been Japan's second leading export category at the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) 4-digit level. However Japan's comparative advantage in ep&c, as measured by Baldwin and Okubo's (2019) method, tumbled after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) while Korea and Taiwan's soared (see Fig. 1). Japan was the world's largest exporter of ep&c before the GFC, but by 2017 Taiwan and South Korea each exported more than twice the value of ep&c that Japan did (Fig. 2). How did Japan lose its comparative advantage in producing microprocessors, flat-panel displays, integrated circuits, and other parts and components?====Katz (2012) noted that integrated circuits and similar goods have become commoditized and that Japanese firms compete in these products based on price. Facing fierce competition from Korea and Taiwan, Japanese firms may lack pricing power. If they cannot raise prices, they may suffer compressed profit margins when confronting adverse shocks.====Japanese companies faced a negative shock in the form of an appreciating yen beginning in June 2007 (see Fig. 3). The GFC generated safe haven capital inflows that caused the yen to appreciate 45% against the U.S. dollar between June 2007 and September 2012. Fig. 3 shows that the yen price of ep&c exports over this period fell 35% relative to yen production costs, where production costs are measured using the producer price index for ep&c. Fig. 4a and b show that, while both the volume and the yen value of Japan's ep&c exports tumbled during the GFC, the volume recovered and exceeded pre-GFC levels but the yen value never did.====This paper investigates whether the strong yen caused yen export prices and thus the value of ep&c exports to fall. Results from exchange rate pass-through equations indicate that yen appreciations led to one-for-one decreases in yen export prices. This implies that exporters followed a pricing-to-market strategy.====The paper then examines whether the appreciating yen caused export volumes to fall by estimating export elasticities using a panel of Japan's exports to major importing countries. The results indicate that yen appreciations caused only small decreases in export volumes. This is what one would expect given that Japanese firms kept foreign currency prices constant in the face of yen appreciations.====Since an appreciation causes yen export prices to fall relative to yen production costs, exchange rate changes should affect the profitability of ep&c producers. To examine this issue the paper estimates exchange rate exposure equations for Japanese semiconductor stocks. Theory implies that stock prices equal the expected present value of future net cash flows. Thus these prices provide information about future profitability. The results indicate that yen appreciations lead to large decreases in semiconductor stocks and that New Taiwan dollar depreciations also lead to large decreases in semiconductor stocks. With the advent of the GFC, not only did the yen appreciate but the NT dollar depreciated. Both of these currency movements acted as negative shocks that lowered the profitability of Japanese semiconductor producers. For comparison, the exposure of Murata Manufacturing is also examined. Murata produces high-end ceramic electronic components. Murata's stock returns are not exposed to either the Japanese yen or the NT dollar.====Sato et al. (2013) investigated how industry-specific exchange rate shocks for the electrical machinery industry affected Japanese communication equipment exports. Communications equipment comes from ISIC code 32 and includes ep&c, televisions, and mobile devices. Sato et al. estimated impulse-response functions from a monthly vector autoregression (VAR) over the January 2001 to February 2013 period. Their VAR included world output, the nominal exchange rate for electrical machinery goods, the price of Japanese electrical machinery goods, the price of foreign electrical machinery goods, and real exports. They reported that an appreciation of the yen nominal effective exchange rate caused Japanese real communications equipment exports to fall. They also found that an increase in Japanese electrical machinery goods prices was associated with a drop in communication equipment exports. Surprisingly, they reported that an increase in foreign electrical machinery goods prices was also associated with a drop in Japanese communications goods exports.====Nishimura and Hirayama (2013) investigated Japan's exports to China using an autoregressive distributed lag model over the January 2002 to December 2011 period. They noted that 70% of Japan's exports to China are intermediate goods and that the lion's share of these are used to produce goods for re-export. When they employed Chinese income as the scale variable, they found that the coefficients on the exchange rate took on the wrong sign (i.e., an appreciation of the yen relative to the renminbi was associated with an increase in Japanese exports). They observed that this could be because an appreciation of the yen/renminbi rate implies a weaker renminbi. A weaker renminbi allows China to export more, and thus to import more intermediate goods from Japan. To control for this effect, they included China's real exports as an explanatory variable. They found that the exchange rate coefficient then took on the correct sign. They also reported that the coefficient on China's real exports was positive and large for Japan's electrical machinery exports, implying that the re-export effect was important for Japan's exports of electrical machinery to China.====Iwaisako and Nakata (2017) investigated how exchange rates, global demand, and other factors affected Japanese aggregate exports using monthly VARs over the January 1977 to September 2014 period. Their VARs included the real effective exchange rate, the growth rate of aggregate exports, two measures of global demand, the price of crude oil and the growth rate of world oil production. Impulse response functions indicated that exports fell in response to a yen appreciation. However, variance decompositions indicated that exchange rate shocks explained less of the variance of export growth over the 2000–2014 period than over earlier periods. They also found that global demand shocks were much more important than exchange rate shocks in explaining falling exports after the 2008 Lehmann Brothers Crisis. Iwaisako and Nakata (2015) reported that, though yen depreciations had a muted effect on exports after 2000, they still mattered because they increased the profitability of Japanese firms.====Fukuda and Doita (2016) provided insights into why the yen depreciation starting in 2012 did not stimulate Japanese exports. They showed using a partial equilibrium model with fixed costs arising from shifting factories across countries that a small change in exchange rates would not affect exports. They also demonstrated theoretically that exchange rates affect exports more when an exchange rate depreciation coincides with strong demand in the rest of the world or when an appreciation coincides with weak external demand. They then examined whether seasonally adjusted Japanese real exports depended on the yen real effective exchange rate and external demand (as measured by exports from G7 countries other than Japan). Their sample period extended from January 1979 to December 2014 and they included a dummy variable equaling one when either an exchange rate depreciation coincides with strong external demand or when an appreciation coincides with weak external demand. They found much stronger evidence that exchange rates mattered for exports when the dummy variable equals one than when it equals zero. Finally they used their export function to calibrate exports and found that over the 2012–2014 period exports calibrated including fixed costs tracked actual exports better than exports calibrated without fixed costs. Their findings indicate that the depreciating yen beginning in 2012 would have increased exports more if external demand had been larger.====Tanaka et al. (2019) also examined the importance of external demand for Japanese exports. They investigated how the Chinese consumer boycott of Japanese goods in 2012 after Japan nationalized three East China Sea islands affected Japanese exports and employment. Using data from the Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and a difference-in-differences methodology, they reported that the shock reduced exports to China. The fall in exports to China was not offset by greater exports to other locations or by increases in domestic sales. They also found that temporary workers were laid off much more than permanent workers, implying that the most insecure workers bore the brunt of the external demand shock.====Yang et al. (2017) examined the spatial configuration of Japan's exports. They used a Spatial Durbin model and annual data over the 1994–2014 period. They found that by the 2010s, an increasing proportion of Japan's exports flowed to Southeast Asia, India, Brazil, and countries in Europe. They also reported that Japan was more likely to export to countries that had free trade agreements with Japan, countries that received foreign direct investment from Japan, countries with more political stability, and countries that had lower levels of GDP per capita. They attributed the last finding to the fact that Japan's exports are capital- and technology-intensive and that importing countries with lower levels of GDP per capita are not competitive in producing these goods.====The research discussed above investigated how exchange rates affected electric machinery exports more generally or overall exports. This paper focuses specifically on Japan's ep&c exports. Given its prominence in Japan's export structure, it is important to understand why Japan's comparative advantage in producing these goods has fallen.====The next section examines the pass-through of exchange rates into ep&c export prices. Section 3 investigates the effect of exchange rate changes on the volume of ep&c exports.

Using originally collected individual-level data, we examine how female teachers in elementary school influence students’ CSR stated preferences in their adulthood. Our major finding is that female teachers affect male but not female pupils’ preferences for corporate responsibility later in life, which offers new evidence from Japan for the female socialization hypothesis. Considering that class teachers are randomly assigned to pupils at entrance to elementary school, this effect is not merely associational but causal.","This study aims to provide new evidence on how learning experiences in childhood lead to a sense of values and economic outcomes. Specifically, we investigate whether being taught by female homeroom teachers leads to a higher preference for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in adulthood. Early childhood education has received increasing attention from social scientists as a key factor determining students’ life paths (e.g., Heckman et al., 2010 a, Heckman et al., 2010 b, Heckman et al., 2013).==== The influence of education is captured both by quantitative, such as the number of years of schooling, and by qualitative factors. Teaching practices and the education system form students’ social capital (Algan et al., 2013), attitudes towards risk (Hryshko et al., 2011), and identity (Aspachs-Bracons et al., 2008).====Our idea to investigate the effect of female teacher on pupils’ CSR preference comes from a fact confirmed in various studies that women show higher CSR than men. Combining this with the fact that early education forms pupils’ attitudes toward sociability, we propose a hypothesis that teaching by women teachers leads to higher sociability in adulthood. Outside of school, children learn from their parents, which shapes their worldview and social values. Preferences for trust and cooperation are transmitted in communities through families (Bisin and Verdier, 2001, Bisin et al., 2004). Men with working mothers tend to prefer working women (Kawaguchi and Miyazaki, 2009) and the wives of men whose mothers worked are significantly more likely to work (Fernandez et al., 2004). As a consequence, the gender gap in labor force participation is reduced over time. There are other types of different-gender matching effects. Men having daughters support women's views (e.g., Glynn and Sen, 2014, Oswald and Powdthavee, 2010, Washington, 2008). According to these studies, women influence men's views and preferences, which is called ==== The aim of this paper is to offer a new example of ==== from Japanese education.====Cronqvist and Yu (2017) examined the ==== in finance by considering how corporate social responsibility (CSR) depends on whether a firm's chief executive officer (CEO) has a daughter. Investors in socially responsible investment (SRI) funds are more concerned with ethical or social issues than with fund performance (e.g., El Ghoul and Karoui, 2017, Ho et al., 2016, Renneboog et al., 2011). That is, investors will forgo financial performance to invest in accordance with CSR preferences (Riedl and Smeets, 2017). While Cronqvist and Yu (2017) explore CSR from the supply side, i.e., the firm's side., this paper intends to further contribute to the CSR literature by analyzing the genders’ interactions with respect to the demand for CSR. That is, CSR demand comes from people who intend to purchase goods supplied by firms that contribute to CSR because they value the firm highly. In other words, CSR investment provides added value to the firm's goods, which increases consumer demand. From the viewpoint of these CSR studies, the second purpose of the current study is to develop a study from the demand side, which are scarcer than those from supply side, especially in Japan.====The Great East Japan earthquake took place in March 2011 and the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016, which caused citizens to recognize the importance of firms’ CSR. In June 2016, we collected individual data from the whole of Japan, with a sample size of approximately 7,000. The data include individuals’ stated CSR preferences and their detailed educational background. These data make it possible to examine how the class teacher's gender in elementary school shapes individuals’ CSR preferences in adulthood and compare the effects between male and female respondents. In Japanese elementary schools, pupils are randomly assigned to classes regardless of the homeroom teacher's gender.==== Especially in first grade, exploring teacher-student gender matching effects on students can be considered a quasi-natural experiment. Schools do not have information about the compatibility between a homeroom teacher and the pupils. Our dataset has information on whether respondents belonged to a female teacher's class in each elementary school grade. A merit of this study is the random matching between teachers and pupils in the first grade of elementary school. Since the sex of the teacher is randomly assigned, the estimated effect of this variable is essentially free from selection bias, meaning there exist no confounders.==== Since the reverse causality from SCR in adulthood to matching at age six does not exist, the estimated effect of women teachers is not a simple association, but rather is causal.====Using regression and propensity score matching analyses, we found the following. Women more than men tend to prefer firms that are responsible toward the environment and local communities, and transparent in governance. While the male pupils who had a female teacher in the first year of the elementary school prefer CSR in adulthood, this effect is not observed for female pupils. This implies that female teacher-male pupil matching reduces the gender difference in CSR preferences, since female teachers tend to have stronger interests in CSR than male pupils, whose CSR concerns are low.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows.

Our empirical evidence suggests that they are positively correlated. This pattern is magnified across Japan's major cities, for which public housing construction is given higher priority. A preliminary mechanism analysis implies that this is partly caused by the rigidity of Japan's housing market, which makes the private-sector housing supply less responsive to demand changes.","Public housing policies, along with subsidies for private rental housing, are utilized in many countries to help low-income residents live in decent dwellings, particularly in populated urban areas.==== Existing studies have analyzed the efficiency and outcomes of the relevant programs, as public housing serves as an important welfare policy. One strand of literature, among others, examines the indirect effect of public housing policies on the competing goods, that is, housing provided by the private sector.====Within this literature, Malpezzi and Vandell (2002) and Eriksen and Rosenthal (2010) find that subsidized low-income housing construction in the U.S. fully crowds out new construction of unsubsidized rental housing units, keeping the total housing supply almost unchanged. In contrast, Murray (1999) finds that subsidized rental housing programs that target very low-income families have only a small crowd-out effect.==== Sinai and Waldfogel (2005) find that government-financed units do raise the total number of units in a market but that one government-subsidized unit increases the total housing stock by only one-third to one-half of a unit on average.====These previous empirical analyses assume that the supply of private dwellings can respond to the balance of housing supply and demand. That is, the private sector is either crowded out by the construction of new public housing (if public housing saturates the market) or unaffected by this new construction (if housing is undersupplied). Nevertheless, neither of these two views considers the possibility that the supply of low-rent public dwellings may lead to an oversupply of housing. This study, which is guided by some stylized facts in Japan, provides the first relevant empirical evidence for this hypothesis.====Public housing accounts for a considerable proportion of Japan's total housing stock, making Japan a novel setting for studying the various consequences of public housing programs. In addition, the housing market in Japan features a high housing vacancy rate. By employing a city-level housing dataset (cross-sectional data from 2003) and controlling for the confounding factors, our ordinary least squares (OLS) regression results reveal that Japan's public housing policies have led to an oversupply of housing and housing vacancies (mainly among privately owned housing). In other words, the high intensity of public housing provision is concomitant with high vacancy rates across Japanese cities.====To be precise, a one-standard-deviation increase (0.047) in the public dwelling share (====), that is, the ratio of the number of public dwellings to the number of total dwellings, is associated with an approximately 0.7 percentage point increase in the housing vacancy rate. To address the issue of reverse causality, we also employ an instrumental variable (IV) approach. We use the intensity of public housing provision from 1961 to 1980, which is less likely to be affected by the housing vacancy rate in 2003 but is highly predictive of the recent public housing stock, as an instrument. Under this approach, the elasticity is estimated to be 0.15. This result implies that if all public dwellings, which account for 6.8% of the national housing stock, are eliminated (an extreme assumption), the housing vacancy rate in Japan will decrease by 1.0 percentage point. By exploiting the internal structure of public housing, we find that only dwellings provided by local government (for which rent is relatively lower than in the private rental market), rather than those provided by urban renaissance agency or public corporation (for which rent is not substantially lower than in the private market), affect vacancy rates.====We then focus specifically on Japan's 24 largest cities, as these cities have constructed nearly half of the country's public dwellings but comprise less than 3% of the country's land area. Owing to the intensive distribution of public housing, we expect the impact of public housing policy to be magnified in these cities. For these cities, we estimate an elasticity of 0.25 using the IV approach; we can interpret this result as implying a decrease in the housing vacancy rate of 2.0 percentage points if no public housing existed (on average, public dwellings account for 7.9% of the total housing stock in these cities). More intuitively, this result implies that increasing the number of public dwellings by one unit leads to 0.25 units of vacant dwellings provided by the private sector.====We propose a preliminary mechanism analysis using a simple housing demand-supply framework. Public housing provision reduces the demand for dwellings provided by the private market and the rent that landlords can charge for their properties. In a frictionless market, the supply of privately owned housing tends to be partly crowded out by public housing and, thus, should decrease (as found by some previous studies, such as Eriksen and Rosenthal (2010)). However, if the housing market is rigid and if the related policies encourage new home construction and sales but discourage existing home sales or demolition, as in the case of Japan, the provision of privately owned housing tends to be less responsive to that of public housing. That is, the stock of private housing is still expanding even though a considerable amount of public housing is already provided and housing is oversupplied. As a result, we find that the housing vacancy rate increases as the intensity of public housing provision increases in Japan. In addition, we discuss an alternative housing assistance strategy, the housing subsidy policy, which does not directly increase the total housing stock and which results in relatively small market frictions in the private market.====Our analysis contributes to the growing literature on the consequences of housing assistance policies. We find new evidence regarding the competing effects of public and private housing that builds on the existing literature (e.g., Sinai and Waldfogel (2005) and Eriksen and Rosenthal (2010)). In this way, we provide new explanations for the high housing vacancy rates in Japanese cities, as most previous studies focus on population aging and political concerns (Fukuda, 2013, Kobayashi, 2016, Zhang, 2017). In addition, our results add to the literature analyzing the housing market in Japan (Börsch-Supan, 1994, Kanemoto, 1997, Kobayashi, 2016, Seko, 2019).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In this paper, we examine this issue by using the Japanese General Social Surveys data. We find that firstborns enjoy more education than later-borns, regardless of gender and the rurality of residence at age 15. We find similar results for income when education is not controlled for. Most strikingly, we find that the presence of male siblings is associated with higher income only for males who lived in a rural area at age 15, with or without controlling for education. These results suggest a potential disadvantage faced by rural boys with no male siblings, especially if they are not the firstborn.","The relationship between birth order and education or labor market outcomes has attracted the keen interest of economists. In East Asian economies such as Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan, whose cultures have been largely influenced by Confucianism, birth order is particularly important. In these societies, birth order has implications in terms of not only the amount of parental investment a child enjoys, but also one’s residential and occupational choices as an adult.==== Therefore, such norms and traditions related to birth order not only may affect the welfare of individuals but also may have aggregate consequences through the misallocation of education investment and labor.==== Nevertheless, relatively little formal economic analysis on this issue has been conducted for Japan.====In this paper, we use microdata from the Japanese General Social Surveys (JGSS) to address how one’s education and income vary with birth order and sibling composition. Since the relevant social norms and traditions may have different implications for males and females and since such norms and traditions may be stronger and more persistent in the country, we compare how the results differ between genders as well as between urban and rural areas.====The Japanese social norms and traditions relevant to our study are described as follows. East Asian countries that were influenced by Confucianism, including Japan, had the tradition of valuing males over females. In addition, the traditional Japanese family is characterized by a unique ==== (stem family) system, under which a single heir (typically the eldest son) inherited the family’s property and sustained the ====.==== Such inheritance norms starkly contrast with the Chinese tradition in which sons inherited equal shares of family wealth. Another key feature of the ==== system was the large flexibility of the logic of patrilineal kinship. When the head of the family had no son or if the son was judged incapable of sustaining the ====, it was common to adopt a male as an heir. Such an adopted heir did not need to be the male kin of the head of the family and could be the daughter’s husband or son or even someone without any blood relationship. This contrasts with the rigid patrilineal kinship system in China, South Korea, and Northwest India, where males without a son adopted one from their male kin.==== As a consequence, the birth of the first son had much greater value for the succession of ==== than that of subsequent sons. At the same time, unlike in societies with rigid patrilineal kinship, daughters were not necessarily marginalized since they also had value for the continuation of the ====.====The ==== system, which was institutionalized by the prewar Civil Code, was abolished under the postwar Civil Code, but the tradition of treating the heir of the ==== differently from other siblings persisted, especially in rural areas. According to an opinion poll in 1968,==== 75% of the 2552 respondents answered yes to the question “Do you think each ==== needs an heir?” and the fraction of positive responses was substantially higher in towns and villages (83.8%) than in Tokyo (64.0%) and the six other largest cities in Japan (69.0%). Further, 56% of the respondents answered positively to the question “Do you think the firstborn son or the heir should receive a greater fraction of the parents’ bequest compared to the other siblings?” Such favorable treatment of the heir, however, is paired with responsibilities. Regarding the question “What do you think is the most important role of the heir?” the top response was “to support the parents” (30%), followed by “to succeed the family name” (17%), “to maintain the ancestral cemetery” (17%), “to succeed the land and house” (11%), and “to succeed the family business” (10%).====Given such a background, income could be linked to birth order and sibling composition through two channels. The first channel is education. Due to norms and traditions, parents may prioritize sons (particularly, the firstborn son) over daughters in the allocation of education investments among children. Alternatively, parents may provide more education to children other than the heir as a substitute for inheritance.==== Either way, the intra-household distribution of educational resources would have implications on the children’s income. The second channel is a source of income differences other than education, such as variations in geographic or occupational mobility. For example, due to the responsibilities mentioned above, firstborn boys may have less geographic or occupational mobility, which would lead to lower income for a given years of schooling. We examine the nature of these two channels by regressing education and (the logarithm of) income on a set of variables associated with birth order.====The JGSS microdata are suitable for our analysis, since they contain information on the respondents’ education, income, sibling composition, and the rurality of residence in youth.==== As a drawback, they do not include, for example, information on twins that could be used to instrument for family size, which may depend on unobserved family characteristics as well as sibling composition. Accordingly, we interpret our estimates to be descriptive rather than causal. In other words, we are interested in discovering, for example, how the income of ====, or males without elder siblings, differ from those of later-born males controlling for observed characteristics, rather than in testing the causal impact on income of being the firstborn male.====Our regression results reveal the presence of a “firstborn premium”==== in education for both males and females, independently of the rurality of residence at age 15. We find a similar result for income when not controlling for education, which suggests that the difference in income is due to the difference in education. Our most important finding is that, for males who lived in a rural area at age 15, the presence of male siblings is associated with higher income; among such rural males, those with at least one brother enjoy approximately 6% higher income when neither education nor the number of siblings is controlled for and 7–9% higher income when one or both of them are controlled for. Such a relationship is not observed for either males who did not live in a rural area at age 15 or females. We explore possible explanations for this result and find geographic mobility to be the most plausible. This result suggests that the special responsibility attributed to ====, or males without elder brothers, may, in fact, be more applicable to ====, or males with no other male siblings. Finally, through an analysis that restricts the sample to particular birth cohorts, we claim that it is premature to consider this relationship between income and the presence of male siblings to be merely historical.====This study contributes to the literature from several perspectives. First, it investigates the associations between birth order and education as well as income in East Asia, a region that has drawn less attention in the literature, despite being known for its social norms and Confucian culture that allegedly give birth order and sibling composition important social and economic implications. Second, this study emphasizes the interaction between the rurality of residence in youth and birth order as well as sibling composition and presents a novel finding on the relationship between income and the presence of male siblings. Third, we explore potential explanations for the lower income of only boys from rural areas and derive policy implications.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In contrast to the conventional threshold specification, this study uses firm predicted exchange rates published by the Bank of Japan, to distinguish between yen appreciation and depreciation periods. Using Japanese export price data at an industry level, we demonstrate that (1) the short-run PTM is almost complete and symmetric in all ==== over the entire sample period from 1997 to 2018 and (2) during the latter sub-sample period from 2007 to 2018, Japanese exporters tend to engage in asymmetric PTM behavior in the long run. In the yen appreciation period, most industries choose incomplete but relatively strong long-run PTM. However, in the yen depreciation period, competitive industries tend to conduct complete PTM in the long run, while less-competitive industries tend to raise the degree of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) in the long run. The results are robust when extended to disaggregated industry level. These empirical findings have important policy implications for the recent unresponsiveness of Japanese real exports to the substantial depreciation of the yen from the end of 2012.","Since Japan adopted a floating exchange rate in 1971, the Japanese economy has faced a large yen appreciation period three times. The latest period corresponds to the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007, witnessing a sharp appreciation of the yen vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar from around 120 in 2007 to the post-WWII record high of 75.32 yen/USD in the end of October 2011 (Fig. 1). In late 2012, however, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe initiated his economic stimulus package, known as “Abenomics,” targeting steady currency depreciation. This put an end to the yen appreciation trend and dramatically turned the yen toward large depreciation from 83.6 in December 2012 to 123.2 in August 2015 vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.====The question of how Japanese export firms reacted to such large fluctuations in the yen from 2007 warrants investigation. Existing studies have typically found strong evidence of pricing-to-market (PTM) or weak evidence of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) in Japanese exports, implying that Japanese exporters tend to stabilize their export prices in response to exchange rate changes.==== For instance, using rolling regression, Ceglowski (2010) demonstrated that Japanese exporters increased the degree of PTM from the late 1990s to 2007. Such empirical findings are consistent with Taylor's (2000) argument for a decline in ERPT, implying that Japanese exporting firms may decrease their pricing power. However, Japanese firms are likely to have changed their export pricing behavior from 2007 in response to the rapid and large appreciation and depreciation periods.====Fig. 1 plots the contract currency-based price==== of Japanese manufacturing exports that exhibits fairly stable fluctuations at around 100 during the rapid and substantial yen appreciation period from 2007 to 2012. Contract currency-based export price is published by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) that reflects the choice of contract (invoicing) currency by Japanese export firms. Given that a large portion of Japanese exports are invoiced in foreign currencies,==== Fig. 1 indicates that Japanese exporters were likely to pursue PTM behavior during the above yen appreciation period. In contrast, the contract currency-based export price started to decline from the late 2013 in response to the further yen depreciation from around 100–120 (Fig. 1).====When observing export prices at an industry level (Fig. 2), however, two major Japanese machinery industries, transport equipment and general machinery,==== exhibit different pricing behaviors in their exports from all manufacturing exports presented in Fig. 1. The contract currency-based export prices increased from the late 2007 to the mid-2009 in response to yen appreciation, while they have stayed at the same level despite the sharp, large depreciation of the yen since the end of 2012. This visual inspection suggests that Japanese exporters’ pricing behaviors are likely to differ not only across industries but also between yen appreciation and depreciation periods.====The main purpose of this study is to empirically investigate possible differences in Japanese exporters’ pricing behaviors between yen appreciation and depreciation periods. The question is how to distinguish between yen appreciation and depreciation periods, and how to estimate possible nonlinear relationship.====Recent studies, such as Delatte and Lopez-Villacencio (2012) and Fedoseeva and Werner (2016), employed the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model proposed by Shin et al. (2014) which has an advantage in testing the hypothesis of nonlinear PTM or ERPT not only in the short run but also in the long run, an effect that cannot be captured via conventional first-differenced models.====However, the current NARDL studies have two drawbacks. First, they rely on the conventional appreciation/depreciation threshold specification in which exchange rate changes are simply divided into positive and negative changes.==== In the medium- and long-run currency appreciation period, for instance, a small, short-lived depreciation often occurs, which is included in the yen depreciation period by the conventional approach.==== But, it is unclear whether the above conventional approach can distinguish correctly between yen appreciation and depreciation periods.====Second, most studies have not considered exporters’ expectations of the future exchange rate that can play a non-trivial role in their pricing decision. Specifically, export firms are typically forward-looking and set their predicted exchange rates for their export planning and business forecasts. Unless the realized exchange rate exceeds the level of the predicted exchange rate, for example, export firms would not revise their pricing behavior. However, the conventional threshold approach, which uses the realized exchange rate to calculate its changes, fails to capture the exporters’ expectations of the future exchange rate. In contrast, our study proposes a new empirical method of threshold specification using firms’ predicted exchange rates published by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), “Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan (TANKAN).” The BOJ administers an extensive survey on exporting firms’ predicted exchange rate that is used for making their business plans and projections. Another advantage of the BOJ's predicted exchange rate is that industry-level data are available, which enables us to capture differences in exporters’ predictions reflecting their export competitiveness.====Utilizing the BOJ's predicted exchange rates and the new threshold approach for the estimation of the NARDL model, we present new empirical evidence that Japanese exporters tend to pursue different pricing behavior between yen appreciation and depreciation periods during the period from 2007 to 2018 when the exchange rate fluctuated rapidly and substantially. Moreover, we find evidence of long-run asymmetry in PTM across industries. General machinery and transport equipment, which are known to have strong export competitiveness,==== show strong tendency toward complete PTM in the yen depreciation period, while the degree of PTM declines during the yen appreciation period. In contrast, the other industries with less-differentiated products tend to exhibit far lower degree of PTM during the yen depreciation period than the degree of PTM during the yen appreciation period. Focusing on general machinery and transport equipment, we conduct additional NARDL estimation using disaggregated sectoral data to examine whether the type of products affects the extent of PTM in exports of these industries. We also investigate the short-run PTM behavior and show that almost full and symmetric PTM is found across all industries for all sample periods, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies that firms’ short-run PTM or ERPT behaviors are strongly affected by the invoice currency choice (Gopinath et al., 2010).====Understanding Japanese exporters’ PTM or ERPT behaviors is crucially important in considering the impact of exchange rate volatility on the Japanese economy. We reveal different pricing behavior not only across industries but also between yen appreciation and depreciation periods. Given that the transport equipment and general machinery, two of the three main manufacturing industries in Japan, do not pass through yen depreciation to their export prices, it is hard to reasonably expect a decline in export prices in response to currency depreciation. Although trade balance is not solely determined by such a price factor, our empirical results at least partly answer the question as to why the Japanese trade balance has been unresponsive to yen depreciation since the end of 2012.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Specifically, I use the change in the regional premium in 2012 as an exogenous shock to the insurance fee schedule: the change in the unit price of LTCI service ranges from a decrease of 2.8% to an increase of 4.2%. I find no increase in the number of employees in the establishments, registered under the LTCI scheme, in municipalities where the regional premium increased. The earnings and working hours of LTC workers did not increase, either.","With a rapidly ageing population, the demand for formal long-term care (LTC) has been increasing in Japan. At the same time, the working age population is shrinking and the shortage of care workers has emerged as a social concern. In particular, the price regulation by the Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) system has often been blamed for exacerbating the shortage of care workers, since it makes it difficult for care providers to adjust service price and therefore wages to meet the increased demand. This paper aims to examine whether increasing the unit price in the LTCI fee schedule has any positive effects on employment or earnings of care workers in the LTC industry.====While many economists pointed out that the decrease in the LTCI fees in 2006 may have aggravated the shortage of care workers (Hanaoka, 2015), empirical evidence of the effect of the LTCI fee schedule on the employment or wages of workers in the LTC industry is scarce. One of the few exceptions that I am aware of is Zhou (2009), who demonstrated that wages of the care workers decreased after 2006. However, this was a nation-wide change and rigorous identification was difficult. To overcome this limitation, Ueno and Hamaaki (2017) used the difference in difference method exploiting the rise of regional premium in 2009 applied only to the 23 wards in Tokyo.====This paper explores the revision of regional premiums in the unit price in 2012 to identify the effect of changes in LTCI fees on employment and earnings in the LTC industry. Following the changes in the regional premiums of national government employees in the late 2000s, the regional premiums for labor costs in the LTCI were revised in 2012. In many municipalities, mainly the three largest metropolitan areas and their surrounding suburbs, the unit price of the LTCI services was raised up to 4.2%, whereas in some municipalities, the price was decreased. I use the variation in this change across municipalities to identify the effect of the price change in LTCI on the number of care workers and their earnings, hours of work, and hourly wages.====I use three datasets for a comprehensive analysis of the effect of LTCI fee changes. I begin with an investigation of the number of employees, capacity, and usage of services at the establishment level, using a panel dataset of LTCI certified care providers taken from the Survey of Institutions and Establishments for Long-term Care. With controls for municipality- or establishment-fixed effects and region-specific year effects, an increase in regional premiums does not have any positive effects on employment. Consequently, the capacity of the service did not increase, either. Next, I examine the effect on monthly earnings, hours of work, and hourly wages using the i. I find no increase in earnings or hours of work.====Given the lack of significant positive effects on employment and earnings, I check whether the total expenditure from LTCI actually increased, using the municipality-level administrative data of LTCI. I confirm that the increase in the unit prices increased the total expenditure, that is, the payment to the LTCI providers. I also find suggestive evidence that bonus increased with a one-year lag.====My empirical strategy is similar to that of Ueno and Hamaaki (2017), who examined the effect of the revision of regional premium in 2009 using the differences in differences method with repeated cross section data of LTC providers. An important distinction of this paper from Ueno and Hamaaki (2017) is that, unlike the 2009 revision that affected only the 23 wards in Tokyo, the 2012 revision affected much more municipalities in different prefectures and with different level of regional premiums before the change,==== allowing me to control for underlying trends in more flexible way. Also, the outcome variables are different. Ueno and Hamaaki (2017) find no significant changes on scheduled monthly earnings and work hours, while bonus increased and turnover rates decreased with a one-year lag. In addition, I examine the effect on employment using establishment level panel data, while I do not have information on turnover rates. My results on earnings, bonus and work hours are consistent with their results.====My findings are different from the existing studies in the United States. Studies that examined the impact of Medicaid reimbursement rates or pass-through subsidies tend to find a positive effect on the number of staff (Cohen and Spector, 1996; Grabowski, 2001; Harrington et al., 2007; Foster and Lee, 2015). However, there are many institutional differences between Medicaid and Japan's LTCI, including population covered (Medicaid covers only financially indigent people) and power to control prices. This paper contributes to the literature by studying a case of public insurance with universal coverage and strict price regulation.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains Japan's LTCI and the change in regional premiums that this paper studies. Section 3 describes the data, Sections 4 and 5 present the empirical model and results, respectively.

Reductions in structural and composition effects drive the fall at the bottom and middle of the distribution, while smaller reductions in structural effects result in the smaller fall at the top. Reductions in gender differences in tenure, regular worker status, education and occupations are associated with the fall in the wage gap over time. However, these variables continue to play important roles in the wage gap in 2016.","South Korea (henceforth Korea) possesses the largest gender wage gap among OECD countries (OECD, 2016). The purpose of this paper is to examine potential explanations for this large wage gap and how these have changed over time. While existing research mainly focuses on differences in mean wages between Korean men and women, this paper uses a recently developed decomposition method to analyze differences in wages across the entire wage distribution (Cho, 2007, Monk-Turner, Turner, 2004). Using such methods, existing research has shown that the size of gender wage gaps and the factors that explain them likely differ across the wage distribution (Christofides et al., 2013). In Korea, evidence of such heterogeneity across the distribution has been uncovered but the specific drivers and potential changes over time have yet to be examined (Cho et al., 2014).====This paper builds on existing research by decomposing the Korean gender wage gap at selected quantiles across the wage distribution and comparing the results in 2003 and 2016. To the best of the author’s knowledge, it is the first to use detailed decompositions to estimate the role of individual covariates in the Korean gender wage gap across the entire distribution and examine how these change over time. This is achieved with a decomposition method introduced by (Firpo et al., 2007) that uses unconditional quantile regressions.==== With data from the Economically Active Population Survey (EAPS), log hourly wages are modeled using an extended Mincer equation. This enables an analysis of how the Korean gender wage gap is associated with factors both common across countries, such as differences in education, and more or less unique to Korea, such as differences in regular worker status.====When decomposing gender wage gaps, several issues are likely to arise. The potential endogeneity of variables in the wage function means the effects of individual variables must be interpreted as descriptive rather than causal.==== Fortin et al. (2010) note that despite this limitation, decomposition methods are useful for measuring the contribution of various factors in an accounting sense and providing insights into which factors are quantitatively important. Another potential issue is differing patterns of selection into employment between men and women. Albrecht et al. (2009) show that if women with low potential wages select out of the labor market, the observed gender wage gap will be smaller than the gender wage gap if all men and women worked. Without suitable data to control for selection, however, this paper mirrors Cho et al. (2014) by focusing on the observed wage gap for workers.==== Although these limitations are less than ideal, this paper’s results are valuable insofar as they provide a comprehensive overview of the Korean gender wage gap and its changes over time.====Existing research on gender inequality in Korea suggests gender differences in the labor market reflect a lag of social change behind economic change. Palley (1990) notes vestiges of Confucian values, that set the role of women as wives and mothers and men as patriarchs and breadwinners, have been difficult to overcome. Brinton et al. (1995) highlight the existence of a marriage bar which is apparent by a discontinuity in female employment after marriage. They also find a negative relationship between women’s levels of education and the probability of employment leading to the conclusion that Korean women use education to compete in the marriage market rather than the labor market. Cho and Cho (2011) add that insufficient provision of childcare services is detrimental to the continuity of women’s careers. Together these factors may explain the low levels of female labor force participation which were 52.9% and 58.4% in 2003 and 2016 compared to OECD averages of 59.5% and 63.6% (OECD, 2018a).====Korean women also tend to work in lower-skilled and lower-paid occupations.==== Turner and Monk-Turner (2007) find a negative correlation between the percentage of female workers in an occupation and average wages. However, the authors reveal a rise in the percentage of women in high-paid professional occupations from 5.4% to 11.3% between 1988 and 1998.==== Kim and Voos (2007) find a reduction in occupational segregation between 1997 and 2002 as well, but show that this reduction was accompanied by a rise in part-time and irregular work among women due to structural adjustments after the Korean economic crisis. Subsequently, Korean women have continued to be over-represented as irregular workers who not only earn less than regular workers but face less protection from the social safety net, more precarious employment and less training (Cho, Lee, 2015, OECD). Cho et al. (2010a) show that Korean women have a higher job turnover rate than men and are more likely to shift from regular to irregular work. The authors posit that this shift causes the greater wage loss associated with involuntary job turnover for women.====Despite sizeable barriers faced by Korean women, research using decomposition methods has shown continued progress in their relative wages over time. Berger et al. (1997) find a large reduction in the mean gender wage gap from 0.82 to 0.61 log wage points between 1980 and 1991. Using Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decompositions, the authors indicate that the key drivers were improvements in education and experience of Korean women relative to men alongside a shift into professional occupations. Monk-Turner and Turner (2004) also find a reduction in the mean gender wage gap between 1988 and 1998. Cho (2007) makes comparisons between gender wage gaps in Korea and the U.S. and finds that Korean women’s lower levels of education, experience and job tenure coupled with greater labor market discrimination explain the higher Korean gender wage gap in 2004.====Cho et al. (2014) provide the first investigation into how the Korean gender wage gap differs across the wage distribution using data from the Korean Labor & Income Panel Study (KLIPS) and decompositions introduced by Chernozhukov et al. (2013). The authors divide workers into groups according to firm size, employment type and education level and carry out ==== decompositions. These break down wage gaps into parts ascribed to differences in ==== productivity and job characteristics (a composition effect) and parts ascribed to differences in ==== those characteristics (a structural effect). The authors find that the glass ceiling effect, which is characterized by larger structural effects at the top of the distribution and believed to be the result of invisible barriers that prevent women from advancing to higher-paid positions, is greatest for irregular female workers at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with lower levels of education.====The aforementioned research suggests that the factors explaining the Korean gender wage gap are diverse and have undergone significant changes over time. This result is confirmed in the current paper. The Korean gender wage gap forms an inverted-U shape across the distribution in both 2003 and 2016. Aggregate decompositions reveal that structural effects are larger than composition effects, structural effects are associated with the larger wage gap around the median and composition effects are relatively constant across the distribution. Between 2003 and 2016, wage gaps fall by 32%, 45%, 35% and 25% at the mean, ==== ==== and ==== quantiles. Reductions in both structural effects and composition effects drive falls in wage gaps at the bottom and middle of the distribution while smaller reductions in structural effects result in the smaller fall in the wage gap at the top of the distribution.====Detailed decompositions show that the key factors associated with the fall in the wage gap over time are reductions in gender differences in tenure at the ==== quantile; regular worker status, occupations, tenure and education at the ==== quantile; and education, tenure and occupations at the ==== quantile. In 2016, the key factors associated with the wage gap are differences in regular worker status and occupations at the ==== quantile; tenure and regular worker status at the ==== quantile; and tenure and large firm employment at the ==== quantile. Thus, despite smaller differences in tenure, regular worker status and occupations, they continue to play key roles in the wage gap in 2016.====Separate analyses are also conducted on gender wage gaps among regular workers and irregular workers. Gender differences in potential experience and marriage play larger roles in wage gaps for regular workers due to the overrepresentation of young and unmarried women among regular workers. Composition effects play minor roles in wage gaps for irregular workers. Between 2003 and 2016, wage gaps for regular workers fall by 14% and 43% at the mean and the ==== quantile, but remain constant at the ==== and ==== quantiles. Increases in structural effects at the ==== and ==== quantiles cancel out decreases in composition effects. Wage gaps for irregular workers fall by 46%, 36%, 41% and 70% across the distribution. As a result, the wage gap for irregular workers at the ==== quantile is not significantly different to zero. In addition, wage gaps for irregular workers are considerably smaller than those for regular workers at the middle and top of the distribution.",The narrowing gender wage gap in South Korea,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915831830090X,11 June 2019,2019,Research Article,109.0

This paper revisits the purpose and design of trade agreements in a theoretical framework that considers the firm’s global production operations with cross-border sourcing of ,"In a recent debate over the changing role of WTO with the prevalence of cross-border unbundling of production process, such as WTO 2.0 (Baldwin, 2014), some academics present critical views against the ‘obsolete’ market-access argument that is associated with the terms-of-trade theory (Bagwell, Staiger, 1999, Bagwell, Staiger, 2002, for theory; Broda, Limão, Weinstein, 2008, Bagwell, Staiger, 2011, for the empirical counterpart). These arguments lack a concrete theoretical rationale behind a reason why countries negotiate international trade agreements, building on the terms-of-trade theory or other relevant economic analysis of trade agreements in the literature of commercial policy. Nevertheless, a way to achieve reciprocal trade liberalization in a efficiency-enhancing manner appears to need to be revisited in the presence of cross-border unbundling of production. In a world with trade in final goods only, the opening up of market access by the importing country immediately implies an increase in domestic value-added created from trade in the exporting country. Such an implication, however, does not necessarily hold once trade in intermediate inputs, or cross-border unbundling of production, is taken into consideration. Trade agreements therefore would need to be designed so that countries cooperate with each other in preserving domestic value-added created from trade rather than through reciprocal exchange of the conventional market access.====Are the terms-of-trade theory and the associated market-access argument no longer plausible in the presence of cross-border unbundling of production? In the commercial policy literature, it is well known that it is not a simple matter to generate models of trade agreements that fall outside the terms-of-trade class, aside from the commitment approach.==== There have been identified only two sources of exceptions: when there exists so-called missing instrument problem (Bagwell and Staiger, 2016) or when international price is determined through bargaining rather than by market clearance (Antràs, Staiger, 2012, Antràs, Staiger, 2012), there is more to be addressed by trade agreements to achieve globally efficient outcomes than simply solving the inefficiencies that arise due to the cost-shifting from country to another through the terms-of-trade manipulation using import tariffs (or other trade policy instruments). These previous studies argue that trade agreements should be designed so as to constrain not only trade policies at the border but behind-the-border policies implemented for protectionist purposes, toward ‘deep’ integration. In a similar vein to the previous studies, the current paper examines whether the presence of cross-border unbundling of production gives rise to a new form of cross-border externalities in non-cooperative trade policy choices, in addition to the terms-of-trade externalities that travel through world prices. If yes, we may conclude that the purpose of trade agreements is called for beyond solving the standard terms-of-trade-driven inefficiencies and that the design of trade agreements should be modified accordingly.====The paper is closely related to Antràs, Staiger, 2012, Antràs, Staiger, 2012, which initiated the economic analysis of trade agreements in the presence of trade in intermediate inputs. Antràs and Staiger highlight the potential for offshoring of customized inputs to increase the prevalence of bargaining as a mechanism for international price determination and argue that the prediction of the standard terms-of-trade theory is overturned if international prices are determined through bargaining. Specifically, the authors consider two ‘small’ countries importing a single homogeneous final good that requires a customized input in a world where all final-good producers are located in the home country and all input suppliers are located in the foreign country. The authors then point out the additional source of inefficiencies arising in non-cooperative trade policy choices that home government has an incentive to intervene against trade in final goods in order to reduce the domestic final-good price and shift bargaining surplus from the foreign input suppliers to the domestic final-good producers.====The current paper has two crucial differences in the model setting from Antràs, Staiger, 2012, Antràs, Staiger, 2012. First, the current paper takes a rather traditional approach that focuses on incorporating trade in intermediate inputs into otherwise standard model of homogeneous (final) goods under perfect competition (with frictionless contracting). The perfect competition assumption on the international market for intermediate inputs is validated by recent empirical finding: Corsetti et al. (2018) show that the less-differentiated intermediate inputs have quite limited destination-specific components to their markups, which means that at least some intermediate inputs are traded in very competitive markets.==== Second, the current paper simply modifies a standard two-good model of trade between two ‘large’ countries by replacing one (final) good with an intermediate input and by introducing non-traded intermediate inputs. To be more precise, we consider a framework in which the final-good producers located in the home country import foreign intermediate inputs to assemble them, combined with domestically-sourced intermediate inputs, into final goods, some of which then are domestically consumed and the rest exported back to the foreign country. We allow imperfect substitutability in production of final goods between domestic and imported intermediate inputs.====Owing to these two differences, although Antràs, Staiger, 2012, Antràs, Staiger, 2012 feature the relaxation of market-clearing discipline on the international terms of trade between buyers and sellers of intermediate inputs, the current paper highlights an interrelationship among market-clearing prices of final goods and the associated domestic and imported intermediate inputs due to their dependence on trade policies through production linkage. The impact of a trade policy targeting certain goods passes through the production chain to the associated goods. We show that the non-cooperative trade policies that are unilaterally chosen by each government so as to maximize the national aggregate income cause negative cross-border externalities and are globally inefficient. Although the terms-of-trade consequences of non-cooperative trade policy choices represent one source of inefficiencies, the interrelationship among market-clearing prices through the production linkage gives rise to an additional source of inefficiencies. That is the cross-border externality that travels through the market-clearing local price for domestically-sourced intermediate inputs in the home country. Such local price externality arises in the sense that foreign government uses a combination of trade policies on the imported final goods and on the exported intermediate inputs to manipulate the local price for the home domestically-sourced intermediate inputs to its advantage at the cost of the home country.====The vertical production linkage between imported and exported goods, together with the imperfect substitutability between domestic and imported intermediate inputs, plays a key role in causing the local price externality.==== In the standard model of trade in final goods only, a government has an incentive to use an export ‘tax’ so as to manipulate the terms of trade to its advantage. In our model, however, a government of the foreign country, from which intermediate inputs are exported to the final-good assembly plant located in the home country and the final goods are subsequently exported back, would use an export “subsidy” on intermediate inputs so as to improve the terms of trade. This terms-of-trade-improving role of input export subsidy implies that foreign government might reduce the import tariff on final goods and, in coordination, raise the export subsidy on intermediate inputs while leaving each of world prices unaltered. That is, given a particular set of world prices, foreign government would unilaterally open up the market access for final goods afforded for the home country while promoting exports of intermediate inputs. Furthermore, in response to the increased volume of trade in final goods and foreign intermediate inputs, the imperfect substitution between domestic and imported intermediates would induce inefficiently home-biased procurement, pushing up the local price for the home domestically-sourced intermediates. By manipulating the local price of home domestic intermediate inputs, foreign government sometimes would shift the cost of its unilateral trade policy changes onto the home country.====We argue that trade agreements must be designed to address inefficiencies arising in non-cooperative policy choices not only because of the international cost-shifting through terms-of-trade manipulation but due to the novel local price externality. In the prevalence of cross-border unbundling of production, the potential of trade agreements to solve the inefficiencies would be called for beyond the conventional market-access argument. To achieve globally efficient outcomes through trade agreements, we propose to re-define the international terms of trade by multiplying the world price of exported (imported) goods by the relative volume of exports (imports) to the overall trade occurring within the production chain. Specifying market access based on this trade-weighted version of the terms of trade enables us to eliminate inefficiencies arising due to the local price externality because foreign government is no longer able to unilaterally open up the market access for final goods in a way that improves the trade-weighted terms of trade to the detriment of the trading partner country. Moreover, holding the trade-weighted terms of trade effectively forces foreign government not to use a combination of trade policies to deteriorate what the trade counterpart can earn, i.e., domestic value-added created, from trade within the production chain. By using the trade-weighted terms of trade, we further discuss how globally efficient outcomes can be achieved through trade agreements in a reciprocal manner.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: the next section sets up a basic model to be used throughout the paper to analyze the purpose and design of trade agreements with cross-border unbundling of production. Section 3 identifies the global efficiency frontier and then shows that non-cooperative trade policies are globally inefficient. Further, we reveal that the conventional market-access focus alone is unlikely to deliver globally efficient outcomes and that trade agreements must be designed to address inefficiencies arising in non-cooperative policy choices beyond the terms-of-trade externalities. Section 4 examines the design feature of trade agreements by proposing an alternative definition of the terms of trade relevant to the presence of cross-border unbundling and by reconsidering the principle of reciprocity based on the alternative terms of trade.

Among these new exporters, an average of 60% stopped serving the same country the following year. These rates are higher if the destination country is a market with which Chinese firms are less familiar. We build a simple two-period model with imperfect information, in which beliefs about their foreign demand are determined by learning from neighbors. In the model, a high variance of the prior distribution of foreign demand induces firms to enter new markets. This is because the profit function is convex in perceived foreign demand due to the option of exiting, which insures against the risk of low demand realization. We then use our micro data to empirically examine several model predictions, and find evidence to support the hypothesis that firms’ high entries and exits are outcomes of their rational self-discovery of demand in an unfamiliar market.","Research shows that firms’ turnover (entry and exit) rates are much higher in foreign markets than in domestic markets.==== This suggests that firms face considerable uncertainty in new foreign markets. Existing theoretical studies postulate that firms can learn about idiosyncratic demand by experimenting with exports to new markets themselves. In practice, however, firms typically attempt to acquire as much information as possible from other firms before undertaking any risky decisions (Hausmann and Rodrik, 2003), especially when this exploration of foreign markets can entail significant sunk costs.==== While economists have studied how learning from neighbors determines individuals’ decisions (Foster, Rosenzweig, 1995, Foster, Rosenzweig, 2010, Conley, Udry, 2010, Moretti, 2011, e.g.), it has not received the same level of attention in the study of export dynamics.====This paper studies the roles of information and learning from others in shaping firms’ export dynamics. We first establish several stylized facts using transaction-level trade data for the universe of Chinese exporting firms over the period of 2000–2006. We find that====These facts are intriguing. One can argue that as fast-growing firms are often seeking new markets, the high ==== rates in many foreign markets among Chinese exporters may not be surprising given the rapid growth of both the Chinese economy and its firms during the sample period. That said, it is surprising to see such high firms’ ==== rates after their first year of exporting. If sunk costs are high, as is commonly assumed in heterogeneous-firm models in trade, embedding the standard Melitz-type model in a dynamic setting with firms’ perfect knowledge about future productivity or demand shocks will not be sufficient to explain such high exit rates (see, for instance, Ruhl and Willis, 2017). To do so, we will need a model that features ex-ante uncertainty in firm-specific demand.====One may propose two intuitive reasons to rationalize such high firms’ entry and exit rates. The first is that new destinations are characterized with high risks but high returns. A dispersed distribution of firm-specific demand with a thick right tail (e.g., a log-normal distribution of firm export sales) may induce firms to rationally enter a new market when the expected sum of profits exceeds the sunk cost of entry. Ex post, however, only a small fraction of firms survive, with some making large profits. The second potential reason is simply that firms are irrationally optimistic about the market’s demand, relative to its true level.====To guide our empirical analysis of the reasons behind firms’ excessive entries and exits in foreign markets, we develop a simple two-period model of firms’ export decisions when the true individual demand in foreign markets are unknown to the firms. At the beginning of the first period, a firm decides whether to export to a foreign market or not, given the prior distribution of the true demand. If it decides to export, it will learn about the true demand at the end of the first period. In the second period, it will decide whether to continue exporting to or exit from the foreign market. Our model predicts that not only high expected demand but also a large variance of the prior distribution can induce firms’ to enter new markets. It is obvious that a higher expected demand is associated with larger expected profits and therefore more market entries. The reason why a high variance of perceived market demand will also encourage firm entry is less clear. In the model, given the option of exiting from the market as a result of low realized demand, the profit function in the second period is convex in perceived foreign demand. By Jensen’s inequality, a higher degree of uncertainty in foreign demand translates to a higher expected value of profit in the second period, which encourages more firms to enter foreign markets in the first period. Thus, our model rationalizes “optimism” based on a standard rational agent model, without any specific assumptions about the distribution of demand factors or firms’ irrational behavior.====To sharpen our point that information flows shape firms’ excessive entries and exits, we also discuss how firms’ observations of neighboring firms’ export performance in a market change their priors. Based on information inferred from neighbors’ export performance in a market, a firm updates its prior about the part of the market demand that is common across firms. However, the signals about foreign market demand are noisy, as observed neighbors’ export performance could be affected by individual firms’ unobserved product appeals, more so for differentiated products. The model shows that a firm’s export decision and post-entry performance depend not only on the number of neighboring exporters serving a particular market, but also the levels and heterogeneity of their export sales, as well as the firm’s own prior knowledge about the market. While more neighbors may offer a more precise signal about a foreign market’s demand, the strength of the signal—the average performance of the neighbors in the market—also matters. A larger number of neighbors selling in a foreign market will raise the rate of firms’ entry into the same market only if the signal is positive, whereas it will actually deter entry when the signal is negative. Our model suggests that to identify potential information spillover in trade, in addition to the stand-alone measures of the number of neighbors serving a foreign market (defined as a country-sector pair) and their average performance in the market, an interaction between the two should be included as a regressor.====Using export transaction-level data for all Chinese exporting firms, we find evidence supporting the main theoretical predictions. We first show that across countries, firms’ entry and exit rates are both positively correlated with the distance from the countries, but negatively correlated with their GDP.==== Moreover, the number of exporters in a market, which presumably provides information about its demand, is negatively correlated with both the entry and exit rates in the market. This negative correlation is even stronger for homogeneous goods than differentiated goods. These results are consistent with the model predictions that exploratory entry and exit are more intense in unfamiliar markets, and information from other firms is more useful for predicting post-entry export performance in homogeneous product markets.====We then show, at the country-sector level, that the exit rate is higher on average in markets that are farther away, controlling for sector-year and exporting-city-year fixed effects. These excessive exit rates for distant markets are lower for differentiated goods, consistent with the idea that firms’ decisions are less responsive to new information from neighbors if market demand is more idiosyncratic.====We then use a restricted sample of all Chinese firms exporting to Sub-Saharan Africa to test the model predictions about firms’ entries. The choice of this regression sample is partly due to the computational constraints of using the full sample, and partly due to the fact that the continent, which has received rapidly growing imports from China, offers an interesting case for our study. We find that a firm is more likely to enter a new market (a country-sector pair) in Sub-Saharan Africa if the strength of the signal—measured by the average demand factor of the market revealed by existing exporters in the same city exporting to same market—is stronger, more so if the number of such neighbors is higher. These correlations are found even with the inclusion of firm-year fixed effects to control for firms’ supply shocks, city-sector-year fixed effects to control for city-level supply shocks, country-sector-year fixed effects to control for countries’ demand shocks, and city-country fixed effects to control for historical linkages between a city and a country.====Finally, we find evidence for the option value of waiting. Specifically, we find that the number of future entrants (in years t+1 and t+2) in a market—our proxy for firms’ (expected) option value—is negatively correlated with firms’ entry rates in a market after controlling for the contemporaneous number of entrants in the same market and an exhaustive set of fixed effects.====The paper is organized as follows.

This paper examines how gender differences in job assignment are associated with the gender gap in pay and promotion using the personnel records of a Japanese manufacturing company. One of the major findings is that broader work experience through job transfers across establishments are associated with a higher promotion probability and future wages for employees of both genders, but this relationship is especially strong for women, which is consistent with the selection and signaling explanations based on statistical discrimination against women. Furthermore, according to our fixed effects model estimation of wage function, broader work experience leads to higher wages for men but not for women, implying that women accept promotions with smaller pay raises than men, which is consistent with the sticky floors model.","The gender difference in labor force participation rates of the OECD countries has been reduced substantially as the female participation rates have risen gradually since the 1970s. Despite such advancement toward equal employment opportunities, gender differences in wages and promotions to management positions still remain in many developed countries and this gap is especially large in Japan (Estévez-Abe, 2013). In order to understand the sources of this gap, previous research has focused on gender differences in the choice of industry and occupation (Macpherson and Hirsch, 1995, Petersen and Morgan, 1995). These studies suggest that women tend to find jobs in lower-paying industries, establishments and occupations. Other works, however, have shown that gender wage differentials still remain after controlling for industry and occupation (Carrington and Troske, 1998, for example). Bayard et al. (2003) focused on differential job assignment within firms by gender, and examined its contribution to the gender pay gap using representative US firm data.====The gender difference in job assignment within the firm may reflect differences in career tracks or training provided through job assignment. Statistical discrimination against women or gender differences in career aspirations may limit them to career tracks with limited promotion probability or lead to differential provision of management training. The previous literature finds that the assignments of developmental job, which help employees to expand their problem-solving and coordination capabilities, are one of the most important training practices in preparing the employees for upper-level management positions (Davies and Easterby-Smith, 1984;==== Hall, 1976, Kelleher et al., 1986). It has been argued that there are gender differences in developmental job assignment for broader job experience that leads to future managerial positions (Ohlott et al. 1994). However, the effect of gender difference in job assignment on promotions and wages has not been fully examined.====Measuring the amount of developmental job assignment given to individual workers, however, is not an easy task. If promotion decisions are path-dependent, dependent on the past history of developmental job assignments, focusing on jobs at one point in time to explain sources of gender pay gap may not be appropriate. Therefore, in this paper, we use the entire lateral transfer experience recorded in the personnel management system based on the premise that broader work experience represents greater management training, and thus a career track with higher promotion potential.====Using personnel records of a Japanese firm, which allows us to exploit rich information on employee characteristics and job assignment histories, this study examines how “career differences” within the firm by gender are associated with a gender gap in pay and promotion while controlling for job types in a sample of college-graduate white-collar workers. We use the term “career” to refer to the history of job transfers within and across establishments. Note that job rotations—the re-assignment to jobs of different functions or locations—are often used to train workers so that they acquire various problem-solving skills and the ability to coordinate across functions.====Job rotation, however, is costly for employers because a worker's productivity will temporarily decline while they are acquiring new skills on new jobs. Therefore, employers are expected to offer such training only to those whose ability is identified as high and those who are less likely to quit. This implies that firms set a higher standard when selecting management trainees from female workers whose probability of separation is higher (Lazear and Rosen, 1990). Since the average ability is higher for women than for men on the same career track when such positive selection for female employees occurs, the odds of promotion for those with broader experience may be higher for female employees.====This prediction, however, can be also explained in terms of signaling theory. Due to the perception that there is higher asymmetric information for women regarding worker commitment and resultant statistical discrimination, women who hope to be promoted may have more incentives to signal their commitment by accepting job transfers, especially those involving relocations and imposing higher private costs (Kato et al., 2016). Therefore, we predict that promotion might be more strongly associated with the level of broader job experience for women than for men.====In general, promotions are associated with large wage increases both in the empirical research (Baker et al., 1994, McCue, 1996) and in the theoretical literature (Gibbons and Waldman, 2006). However, ‘The sticky floor’ model suggests that women may receive smaller wage increases at the time of promotion than men because the former's outside options are limited (Booth et al., 2003). Thus, we also examine the association between job assignment and wage increase to see whether there is a gender difference in the relationship between them.====Data from a Japanese firm is suitable for this study because statistical discrimination is likely to be prevalent in Japan. Before the Equal Employment Opportunity Law was enacted in 1986, women were often excluded from the benefit of “lifetime employment”—one of the main features of the Japanese employment system—instead, they were offered a different career path, typically as administrative assistants. Although the Equal Employment Opportunity Law, subsequent amendments to the law, and the revised Labor Standards Act in 1999 have forced firms to offer the same work opportunities and conditions to both genders, and many women have entered traditionally male-dominant jobs, the job separation rate is still much higher for women than for men and the proportion of female manager is still low (Abe, 2011, Wakisaka, 2013, Yamaguchi, 2016).====Our empirical analyses suggest that there can be gender differences in career opportunities whereby only a part of able and motivated women receive developmental job assignment as managerial training, whereas most men are on the management trainee track and receive such training. We find that the relationship between broader job experience and the incidence of promotion is stronger for women than that for men and this phenomenon can be attributed not only to positive selection for women, but also to women's signaling their commitment to work. Further, the gender gaps in promotion and wage are found to be narrower in the specialist job such as R&D than other jobs. Finally, our result suggests that the wage increase at the time of promotion subsequent to broader job experience is smaller for female workers than for male counterparts, supporting the sticky floor hypothesis.====This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we briefly review recent literature on job segregation and promotion; Section 3 explains the dataset used in this study and provides a variety of descriptive statistics; Section 4 explains our empirical strategy; Section 5 presents estimation results from our analyses of wages and promotions; and we conclude in Section 6.",Gender differences in Career,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158318300650,14 April 2019,2019,Research Article,112.0

Our data were collected in 2013 and 2014 from residents displaced by the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster in 2011. We examine how a sudden gain/loss affects stress/utility in four dimensions/resources: family size, health, house size, and income. We find that (i) there is a higher sensitivity to losses from a reference point than to gains (i.e., loss aversion) in health, and possibly in income as well, (ii) the reference point may change over time, and (iii) value function is not separable in the four dimensions/resources. These findings have a few implications. First, in view of the loss aversion, a sufficient—apparently more than enough—compensation should be provided to those who lost so that they can regain the original utility. Second, if the reference point is lowered, the victims must be over-compensated for their loss to recover the original utility. Third, separable value functions should be used with caution.","Models of reference-dependent preference and loss aversion in the prospect theory have been tested in many laboratory experiments, but there is little real-world evidence (Köbberling, 2006, DellaVigna, 2009). Exceptions are Camerer et al. (1997), Genesove and Mayer (2001), Mas (2006), Crawford and Meng (2011), Barseghyan et al. (2013) and DellaVigna et al. (2017), who examined the prospect theory in a variety of contexts such as housing market, finance, labor supply, insurance, and employment. The findings of these studies are largely consistent with the prospect theory. Whereas DellaVigna et al. (2017) exploit exogenous variations arising from a policy change, in the existing literature, there remain issues such as identification of causal relationship, reference dependence in high dimensions, and generalizability of laboratory empirical results into a real life experience.====To bridge these gaps in the existing studies, we test basic components of the prospect theory by exploiting a natural experiment generated by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, March 2011, in Japan. We adopt a regression kink (RK) approach to analyze our unique data, exclusively collected for this study in July 2013 and December 2014 from residents of Futaba who were unexpectedly displaced due to the disaster; Futaba is a town in Fukushima.====Since Futaba is located within a 2-10 km radius from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the government placed an indefinite evacuation order. All Futaba residents were forced to move from their homes, and many residents lost stable incomes and faced a high level of psychological stress (Iwasaki et al., 2017). The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) as well as the Japanese government provided a variety of monetary and non-monetary compensations. Specifically, TEPCO provides 100,000 yen (approximately 1,100 USD) per month per person for psychological injuries, the full compensation for the lost assets, and a compensation for the expected income they would get, had they not experienced the displacement. This unforeseen incident provides a natural experiment, with individuals exogenously and unexpectedly losing their family members, health, home or income.====Applying RK to our natural experimental data, we test reference dependence and loss aversion, the two basic components of the prospect theory introduced by Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Reference dependence is that individual’s value/utility function is defined over the relative difference from a reference point, instead of the absolute level. Loss aversion is that the value function has a kink at the reference point and is steeper for losses than for gains. Thaler (2016) listed loss aversion as one of the three most important concepts of behavioral economics, and stated that most of prospect theory’s predictive power comes from its crucial assumptions including reference dependence and loss aversion.====We use pre-disaster levels as reference points for the evacuees’ utility function, because the disaster was unforeseen and the rate of migration among the elderly of Futaba who are the major respondents of our surveys is low. According to the 2010 Population Census of Japan, among those aged 65 or above in Futaba, only 4.1% moved out of their town or city, compared with five years ago. Hence we adopt the pre-disaster family size, health status, house size, and income as reference points to test the theory. Although we set our reference point to be pre-disaster levels in our main analysis, we conduct an additional analysis taking into account the possibility of reference point revision as well.====For utility, we use essentially two variables: a happiness/satisfaction variable as in Vendrik and Woltjer (2007), Di Tella et al. (2010) and Boyce et al. (2013), and a ‘negative mental stress’ variable because mental stress may be taken as the flip side of happiness; unfortunately, the happiness variable was collected only in 2014. We consider four dimensions/resources in the utility function: ====.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains our data. Section 3 lays out our empirical strategy to verify the prospect theory. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Finally, Section 5 concludes our findings. As usual, we often omit the subscript ==== indexing individuals in variables, because we assume that our observations are independent and identically distributed across ====. Putting some of our main findings in advance, reference dependence and loss aversion hold in health and possibly in family size as well, and there is strong empirical evidence that utility function is not separable in its arguments, contrary to what is often presumed in economic theory.",Verifying reference-dependent utility and loss aversion with Fukushima nuclear-disaster natural experiment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158319300139,8 April 2019,2019,Research Article,113.0

Our results imply that the significant decline in Japan's birth weight can be attributed to unfavorable changes in the country's labor market conditions.,"Birth weight in Japan has continued to decline, and the share of low-birth-weight babies has increased over the past 35 years. In 2010, Japan's average birth weight was 3.0 kg, with 9.6% of newborns classified as having a low birth weight; this is much higher than the average of approximately 3% for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (OECD, 2013). What are the reasons for this high ratio of low-birth-weight babies in Japan? This paper aims to reveal the effects of macroeconomic conditions on infant health in Japan, with particular focus on the effects of unemployment and contingent employment, which increased substantially owing to changes in Japan's labor market conditions since the 2000s.====To explain the effect of labor market conditions on birth weight, we use provincial panel data taken from several national surveys conducted every five years from 1975 to 2010 in Japan. Utilizing provincial panel data but not individual microdata has two major advantages, although using aggregated data does not allow us to investigate the mechanism of parental employment status on infant health. First, provincial data can capture the average but the entire tendencies of all provinces in the entire country and their changes over time. Sampling data on individual health do not usually capture all the individuals and may sometimes have a sample-selection problem. For example, one survey does not cover those with bad health, and another survey covers only patients. Individual data on employment status also have a sampling problem. Those who lose jobs have a tendency not to respond to surveys. These problems do not exist if we use administrative data on individuals. However, administrative data both on birth weight and on unemployment situations do not exist in Japan as in many other countries.====The second advantage relates to the problem of unobserved characteristics. Analyses on individual health are prone to serious endogeneity bias because of unobserved heterogeneity leading to both poor infant health and parental unemployment, such as a parent's unobserved non-cognitive ability and genetic characteristics, or reversed causality such as the case when poor infant health might prevent parents from working. Although endogeneity bias can be resolved by using an instrumental variable (IV) method, finding valid instruments is challenging. In contrast, explanatory variables for average health differences between provinces or changes over time can be found easily, and are less affected by the potential problem of unobservable characteristics, since the errors as well as the focal effects are averaged out. Provincial panel data are also less affected by outliers or measurement errors because they are aggregated. Although averaging out and aggregation might underestimate the possible effects of unemployment on infant health, the implication would jump out if we did, indeed, find significant effects. We examine the causality carefully, controlling for both time and prefectural characteristics by non-stochastic error term in the fixed effects model or by stochastic error term in the random effects model (two-way error component model).====This paper is unique in three ways. There have been no Japanese studies on the relationship between parental economic conditions and infant health, although the relationship is one of the hottest issues for empirical testing. It is apparent that infant health is determined not only by genetic factors but also by parental socioeconomic conditions, including parental working status (Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1983, 1988; Currie and Hyson, 1999, Currie and Moretti, 2003, Hoynes et al., 2015). Although our focus is the effect of macroeconomic conditions, this is strongly related to the labor market conditions for parents. We can derive some implications for the relationship between parental employment and infant health.====Secondly, the empirical investigation of the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and health using regional panel data is an interesting one. Many empirical studies have examined how macroeconomic conditions affect adult health, such as physical and mental illnesses, and chronic and acute illnesses. They usually focus on rates of mortality, suicide, and/or accidental death. There are many studies suggesting that an increase in unemployment rates leads to better health for workers, while other studies present the opposite results, as will be summarized in the next section. This paper offers new findings on this topic, although our focus is infant health in terms of birth weight.====Thirdly, we examine the effect of labor market conditions not only on the unemployment rate but also on the ratio of the “working poor,” focusing on an increase in contingent workers in Japan's working population. Contingent workers are rarely guaranteed fringe benefits, earn lower wages, and receive less protection under the law, with an accompanying lack of job security. Indeed, the well-being of contingent workers, who often fall below the poverty line, is becoming a serious public concern. Although the issue of working poor is not a problem that Japan alone faces, the OECD 2008: p. 136) showed that in the mid-2000s, over 80% of the working-age poor households in Japan had at least one wage earner, a figure higher than in many other OECD countries.====Note here that an empirical investigation of this topic, especially using Japanese data, is extremely important. Japan experienced dramatic changes in its labor market conditions in the 1990s and 2000s. The effects of such changes on health should be found in a country such as Japan if, indeed, there are any effects. Furthermore, there is an important welfare implication if we find that an exogenous economic condition is one of the determinants of low birth weight, especially in Japan, which has long achieved universal health coverage. If the changes in labor market conditions continue to have a significant impact on infant health, we need more support for workers negatively affected by idiosyncratic economic fluctuations. Furthermore, if negative consequences passed down to future generations, attention should be paid to the intergenerational transfer of health-determining factors.====Our empirical results show that an economic downturn, indicated by high rates of unemployment, increased the share of low-birth-weight babies and decreased the average birth weight until the 1990s, but this effect became smaller or disappeared after the 2000s. In contrast, high rates of contingent employment have led to deteriorations in infant health in terms of their constantly even birth weight after 2000. Adverse labor market conditions in one generation can translate as poorer health in the next generation through a reduced birth weight.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

This paper examines if we observe positive impacts of the policy in the data. We first estimate a gravity model of bilateral FDIs using data for 35 ==== countries as destination countries. In estimating the model, we handle zero values for FDI stock explicitly. The model includes (origin and destination) country-specific effects as well as destination-country specific time trends. We take the model prediction as a reasonable counterfactual and compare that to the actual inward FDI stock for Japan. Although the actual inward FDI stock has been growing and is likely to achieve the goal of 35 trillion yen by 2020, the growth under the Abe administration has been comparable to or slightly lower than the counterfactual suggested by the estimated model. We also estimate the model without Japan as a destination country and use the estimated model to calculate the counterfactual level of Japan's inward FDI. Although we expect the gap between the counterfactual and the actual become narrower if Abenomics policy has been successful, we fail to find that. These results cast a doubt on the effectiveness of the Abenomics policies to encourage inward FDI at least as of 2015.","An important motivation for corporations to expand into foreign countries is to use their advantage over the competitors in the host countries. Thus, foreign companies often have higher productivities than domestic companies.==== From host country's point of view, allowing more foreign direct investment (FDI) may lead to higher economic growth through productivity spillovers from foreign companies, which would ultimately increase social welfare.====The benefit of increasing inward FDI for Japan may be especially large because Japan has been known for its very low level of inward FDI compared with other advanced economies. Table 1 presents the inward FDI stock to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio for 35 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1985 to 2015.==== The table indicates that the inward FDI stock to GDP ratio for Japan is 4.2% in 2015, far below the OECD average of 50.4% and the smallest among all the OECD countries.====Recently Japan has tried to promote inward FDI to enhance its potential growth. Promotion of inward FDI has been an important goal of the growth strategy under Abenomics. Since 2013, the Abe administration pursued the goal of increasing its inward FDI stock to 35 trillion yen (up from 19.2 trillion yen at the end of 2012) by 2020. Fig. 1 plots the inward FDI stock for Japan from 1996 to 2017. By the end of 2017, Japan's inward FDI stock rose to 28.6 trillion yen. At this rate, the goal of 35 trillion yen will be easily reached by 2020. As Hoshi (2018) argues, however, Abenomics does not seem to have changed the long-run trend of Japan's inward FDI. The increase of inward FDI under Abenomics is almost exactly what the past trend would have predicted. Thus, Hoshi (2018) concludes that there is no evidence that the Abenomics policy to promote inward FDI has been effective.====This paper also examines Japan's inward FDI under Abenomics, but goes beyond Hoshi (2018) by using more carefully constructed counterfactual than a simple extrapolation of the past trend. We estimate gravity models of FDI stock and use those to infer how Japan's inward FDI stock would have evolved in the absence of Abenomics policies. We implement two slightly different approaches.====In the first approach, we estimate a model that assumes country fixed effects. We start by estimating the gravity model of inward FDI stocks for OECD countries from 1985 to 2012, noting that Abenomics was started in December 2012.==== Then, we use the estimated model to predict inward FDI stock for Japan after 2013. We interpret the predicted values to be the inward FDI stocks that would have been observed if the Abenomics had not started its promotion of inward FDI. If the Abenomics policy of promoting inward FDI was effective overall, we would expect to find that the total inward FDI in Abenomics years exceeds the predicted values.====In the second approach, we exclude Japan as a destination country in estimating a gravity model. We then use the estimated model to calculate what Japan's inward FDI stock would be. We examine the gap between the counterfactual calculated in this way and the actual inward FDI to Japan. If Abenomics policy has been successful, we should find the gap has narrowed under the Abe administration.====Both of these analyses look for the changes in Japan's inward FDI after 2013 that cannot be explained by GDPs and other observables in the gravity model. These unexplained changes would certainly include the impacts of the Abenomics policy to promote inward FDI, but they may reflect many other factors that are not related to Abenomics. Thus, it is possible that we overestimate or underestimate the impacts of Abenomics policy, depending on what kind of factors that we are missing. This is a weakness of our approach.====Our paper adds to the growing literature on inward FDI into Japan. Several studies examined the determinants of inward FDI to Japan.==== Kimino et al. (2007) looked at FDI flows from 17 countries to Japan between 1989 and 2002. They found that source country characteristics such as political and economic stability were important determinants of inward FDI to Japan while exchange rates and labor costs were not.====Sato and Oki (2012) studied the distribution of US outward FDI from 1990 to 2009. They estimated a log-linear version of gravity model and found that the US FDI to Japan was low compared with other destination countries even after controlling for gravity variables such as the market sizes of the destination countries. They concluded that Japan was less attractive for the US investors than other countries, although they did not explore what made Japan less attractive.====Head and Ries (2005) also estimate the gravity model for Japan's FDI, but they put that on a solid theoretical ground. Based on the framework developed by Head and Ries (2008), they estimate a gravity model of FDI using the data for 181 countries from 1980 to 2002. Their results indicate that both inward and outward FDI shares of Japan is lower than the prediction of the model.====Our paper builds on these previous studies and asks if the low level of inward FDI stock in Japan has changed under Abenomics. The paper also introduces a methodological improvement on the previous studies, many of which estimated a log linear form of the gravity model. A problem is that many country pairs have no FDI between them. The previous studies usually dealt with this problem by dropping the country pairs with zero FDI. Throwing away the observations with zero FDI, however, leads to inconsistent parameter estimates. To solve this problem, we employ Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood model proposed by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006). In addition to the explicit treatment of zero FDI, our study covers a longer and more recent period than the previous studies.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief overview of the policies to promote inward FDI to Japan under Abenomics. We argue that success of any of those policies is likely to show up as a structural shift of the relation between Japan's inward FDI and its standard determinants in a gravity model such as distances and sizes of the origin countries. Section 3 introduces gravity models of FDI and the estimation method that we use in this paper. The section also goes over the two approaches we use to examine the effectiveness of the FDI promotion under Abenomics. Section 4 describes the dataset we use and reports summary statistics. Section 5 reports the estimation results and discusses if the Abenomics FDI promotion policy has been successful.

"Russ Katheryn N.,Swenson Deborah L.","Economics Department, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA, 95616, USA","Received 10 October 2018, Revised 12 January 2019, Accepted 18 February 2019, Available online 13 March 2019, Version of Record 3 April 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjie.2019.02.001,Cited by (18)," Agreement (KORUS) drew U.S. import demand away from other U.S. trading partners through the phenomenon known as trade diversion. In the two years following the implementation of KORUS, trade diversion was particularly strong for U.S. imports of consumption goods and for trade partners who already had free trade agreements with the U.S. Our estimates of trade diversion sum to $13.1 billion in 2013 and $13.8 billion in 2014. Notably, these estimates of trade diversion are roughly of the same magnitude as the increase in the U.S. bilateral goods trade deficit with South Korea. Thus, while increased U.S. imports from South Korea may have increased the U.S.-South Korea bilateral trade deficit, the fact that KORUS diverted U.S. import demand away from other trading partners implies new U.S. imports from Korea stimulated by the KORUS did not expand the overall U.S. trade deficit.","The Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) received intense criticism from many quarters after it went into force in March 2012: President Trump has argued that the agreement allows South Korea to exploit the United States. More broadly, a number of critics have pointed to the U.S.- South Korea bilateral trade deficit which grew rapidly following the implementation of the agreement. However, whether and how regional free trade agreements affect trade imbalances remains an open question. The 2018 Economic Report of the President (Council of Economic Advisers, 2018, p.230) sums up the issue:====Nonetheless, due to the temporal coincidence of the deterioration in the U.S.-South Korea trade balance immediately following implementation of KORUS, and in light of the importance of trade balances as political fodder in public discussions of trade agreements, it is worth evaluating dimensions on which FTAs may potentially affect bilateral trade balances. To this end, the goal of this paper is to estimate the degree and facets of trade diversion that were generated by the provision of KORUS tariff preferences, and to examine how the overall magnitude of these trade diversion effects compares with the actual change in the U.S.-South Korea trade balance. The question is important because trade diversion may increase the U.S. bilateral trade imbalance with an FTA partner, but cannot affect the overall U.S. trade balance since it simply transfers U.S. import demand from one trading partner to another.====To tackle these questions, we estimate the magnitude of trade diversion which can be attributed to U.S. KORUS policies. First, we use a method of estimating trade diversion pioneered by Romalis (2007) in his assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Canadian-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. This involves measuring whether U.S. imports from third countries were sensitive to the U.S. tariff preferences extended to South Korean goods. This approach compares U.S. imports from South Korea versus other countries based on the goods-level tariff preferences. To control for external factors which also shaped the export capability of South Korea relative to other countries, the relative comparison for Australia and Canada’s imports is used as a reference point. We find that a 1% decline in the U.S. tariff on a South Korean (HS-6) product was associated with between a 0.7% and a 1.4% decline in U.S. imports from third countries as a share of Australian or Canadian imports of the same product lines from the same third countries each year between 2010 and 2014.====In aggregate, we find that trade diversion may have redirected $13.1 billion and $13.8 billion worth of U.S. imports away from third countries in 2013 and 2014, amounts roughly comparable in size to the growth in the U.S. bilateral goods trade deficit from its level in 2011. Aggregating across all trading partners, we find that the redirection of imports to South Korea was largest for apparel and textile products, followed next by imports in the electronics and footwear sectors. Reduced U.S. imports from China, particularly in footwear, apparel, textiles, and electronics, accounts for roughly half of the gross implied trade diversion. Reduced imports from Mexico account for about one-seventh, concentrated in electronics and vehicle parts.====By definition, because trade diversion occurs when buyers reduce imports from some trading partners by shifting their import purchases towards the country facing newly lowered tariffs, trade diversion affects bilateral trade balances, but leaves the overall trade balance (across all trading partners) unchanged. Therefore, our empirical findings are consistent with the common assumption in structural models that trade agreements may affect bilateral trade balances without directly affecting the overall trade balance. The new trade agreement will not affect the overall national trade balance unless it changes macroeconomic conditions, as it might in the longer term if freer trade has an effect on national macroeconomic conditions or growth rates of the partner and third countries.====Although the majority of trade diversion that we observe is with respect to non-U.S.-FTA partners, we also observe that trade diversion is strongest with respect to earlier U.S. FTA partners, who bear more than one-fifth of our measured trade diversion. This has important policy implications, suggesting that a substantial component of trade diversion under KORUS corrected earlier distortions that had previously suppressed imports from South Korea or other countries, in favor of competing suppliers in pre-KORUS U.S. FTA partners. Consequently, the trade diversion reported here with respect to existing FTA partners does not imply the more unequivocally negative welfare effects generally associated with the trade diversion when all partners start from a position of identical tariff treatment by the importing country (Fig. 1).",Trade Diversion and Trade Deficits: The Case of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158318301394,13 March 2019,2019,Research Article,116.0
Sasahara Akira,"College of Business and Economics, University of Idaho, 875 Perimeter Drive MS 3161, Moscow 83844-3161, United States","Received 24 October 2018, Revised 3 February 2019, Accepted 20 February 2019, Available online 23 February 2019, Version of Record 28 March 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjie.2019.02.004,Cited by (15),"This paper estimates and decomposes the impact of export opportunities on countries’ employment by using a global input-output analysis, focusing on the U.S., China, and Japan. The greater they export, the greater employment in the exporting countries. However, we first document that the number of jobs created per exports varies substantially across destination countries. We find that exports from sectors with higher domestic value-added contents such as natural resource, textile, and service sectors lead to a greater employment effect. As a result, cross-country differences in sectoral compositions of exports explain a large part of the variations in the employment effects across destination countries. Time series changes in the employment effect of exports come from changes in (1) the labor-to-output ratio, (2) input-output linkages, and (3) sectoral compositions in exports. Results suggest that the first channel worked to reduce the employment effect in all of the three countries we focused but the directions of the last two channels are different across the countries.","Export opportunities to foreign countries create jobs in exporting countries. Previous literature finds a substantial employment creation effect of exports using an input-output analysis (e.g., Los et al., 2015b, for the impact on China’s employment; Feenstra and Sasahara, 2018, for U.S. employment; Feenstra and Sasahara, 2019, for employment in Asian countries). However, the employment effect per exports- roughly speaking, productivity of exports in creating employment - is not explored in the literature. We investigate if the size of employment generated by exports can be described by a one-to-one mapping from the size of exports. If so, we do not have to use an input-output analysis to find employment effects of exports and the total value of exports would be a sufficient statistic to know the employment effect of exports.====Results from the analysis show that the employment effect of exports is not just the size of exports and the employment effect per exports varies substantially across destination countries. Then we further examine why some countries create more jobs per exports than others do. We find that exports from some sectors such as natural resources, textile, and services lead to a greater number of jobs than exports from other sectors. This is consistent with the recent literature on value added in trade, finding a substantial amount of intermediate good trade in manufacturing industries, making domestic value-added content of manufacturing exports smaller (e.g., Johnson and Noguera, 2012). Therefore, the employment effect per exports varies across destination countries primarily due to differences in sectoral composition of exports. Because countries sell disproportionally more services domestically, domestic final demand leads to more jobs for the same value of final demand.====Our analyses focus on three major countries in the world, the U.S., China, and Japan where these countries account for 41% of world GDP and 26% of world merchandise trade as of 2014 (World Bank, 2017) and they have large influences on the world economy. Therefore, it is critical to understand the employment effect of exports on these countries. Comparing these three countries, we find that employment effects of foreign final demand per million dollar exports on China are crucially different from those on the U.S. and Japan. For example, the employment effect of foreign final demand per exports on China, relative to the employment effect of China’s final demand, is increasing over the period 2000–2014 because domestic value-added contents in China’s exports are rising as shown in previous studies (e.g., Kee, Tang, 2016, Koopman, Wang, Wei, 2012). On the other hand, the employment effect of exports relative to that of domestic final demand is slightly declining in the U.S. and Japan.====We also find an interesting result that the three countries differ in sectors in which the employment creation effects are greater. For example, exports from the textile sector creates the greatest number of jobs in China while the service sector is the most important for the U.S. and Japan. This suggests that a country’s development level has a close link with sectoral contributions in creating jobs. Forward and backward linkages with other countries also affect the employment effect of exports. We show that the impact of international production linkages on the employment effect of exports is complicated. Deeper backward linkages are particularly complicated as these sometimes lead to job replacement and sometimes boost exports due to an increase in the number of available intermediate inputs from abroad (see Feng et al., 2016, for the case in China; Harrison and McMillan, 2011 and Wright, 2016, for the case in the U.S.).====Regarding time-series variations in the employment effect of exports, it declined by 30%, 60%, and 5% in the U.S., China, and Japan, respectively, during the period 2000–2014. Time-series changes in the employment effect of exports per exports are decomposed to changes in (1) the labor-to-gross output ratio, (2) the sectoral composition in exports, and (3) input-output linkages. Results suggest that a decrease in the labor-to-gross output ratio — i.e., an increase in labor productivity — is the biggest reason why the employment effect of exports declined in the U.S. and China. If a country becomes more productive and one unit of labor produces a greater amount of output, then it means that a one unit increase in exports requires a fewer number of labor. We also find that changes in sectoral composition of exports worked to reduce the employment effect of exports in the U.S. and China. Changes in input-output linkages slightly reduced the employment effect of exports in the U.S. while it increased the employment effect of exports in China. We find small time-series variations in the employment effect of exports in Japan during the same period.====This paper contributes to a growing body of literature on the employment effect of international trade, focusing on a positive employment creation effect of exports (e.g., Los et al., 2015b, for China; Vianna, 2016, for Latin American countries; Feenstra, Ma, Xu, 2017, Feenstra, Sasahara, 2018, Liang, 2018, and Magyari, 2017, for the U.S.; Feenstra and Sasahara, 2019, and Kiyota, 2016, for Asian countries). Among these studies, this paper is particularly related with Los et al. (2015b), Feenstra and Sasahara (2019), Feenstra and Sasahara (2018), and Kiyota (2016) because we also use an input-output analysis and quantifies the employment effect of foreign final demand.==== We go beyond the existing literature by highlighting the fact that the employment effect per exports varies substantially across destination countries and by explaining the reasons why they differ.====Echoing recent studies investigating implications of value-added contents of trade under expanding Global Value Chains (hereafter GVCs), we aim to understand how value-added contents affect the employment effect of exports. Expanding GVCs have a significant connection with various economic indicators (see Feenstra, 1998, Baldwin, 2012), especially in East Asia (see Ando, Kimura, 2005, Ando, Kimura, 2014, Kimura, Obashi, 2016, Obashi, Kimura, 2017).==== Previous studies show that GVCs and value-added contents of trade alter our previous understanding of trade imbalances (Johnson and Noguera, 2012), U.S. employment in import-competing sectors (Shen, Silva, 2018, Shen, Silva, Wang, 2018), business cycle synchronization (Duval et al., 2016), exchange rates (Bems and Johnson, 2017), trade policies (Blanchard et al., 2017), Heckscher-Ohlin trade patterns (Ito et al., 2017), and geographical distribution of ‘good’ jobs and ‘bad’ jobs (Baldwin et al., 2014).====This paper considers an implication of GVCs from a different angle. We investigate whether GVCs and value-added contents of trade affect the employment creation effect of exports from a country. This paper is inspired by Feenstra (2017), proposing an idea that value-added contents of trade are considered as the ‘second generation’ measure of offshoring and suggesting its implication on labor markets. In terms of focus, the paper is the most closely related with Ito (2018), examining the effect of expanding GVCs on ==== employment. Our focus is similar but it differs from Ito (2018) because we focus on how deepening GVCs affect the employment creation effect of exports ====.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section estimates the employment effect of exports and discusses results. Section 3 finds domestic value-added contents in exports and consider how these are associated with the employment effect of exports. Section 4 provides a decomposition exercise in order to understand why the employment effect of exports has changed over time. Section 5 concludes.

The relationship between the dissemination of information and its role in efficiently allocating resources across firms is fundamental to the growth and development of an economy, especially when the firms are engaged in producing innovative new products that could themselves stimulate growth in other industrial sectors.====It has been well established that the Chinese economy, in which a competitive market-based economy operates alongside a state owned sector, suffers from resource mis-allocation that manifests as lower than potential productivity. (See Hsieh and Klenow, 2009 and Dollar and Wei, 2007). However, among competitive market-based firms, one might expect efficient resource allocation associated with clear dissemination of information about market conditions such as the demand for a product. In this paper, we study a unique series of policy changes that (1) threatened to dramatically reduce Chinese firms’ access to the EU market, (2) temporarily restricted Chinese solar panel exports to the EU significantly, and (3) finally resulted in moderate import restrictions against Chinese solar panel products. Moreover, in addition to these negative external demand shocks, we examine domestic policy shocks intended to stimulate China’s domestic demand: (1) the announcement of a domestic development plan with explicit quantitative targets for the installation of solar panels and (2) the announcement of a domestic subsidy plan that would only benefit power generators that adopted solar panels for electricity generation. Our analysis examines how stock market returns evolved for 37 Chinese solar panel firms that were publicly listed in different stock markets around the world.====Our analysis begins with event studies of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) in three distinct stock markets - New York, Shanghai-Shenzhen and Hong Kong - in response to a series of announced policy changes regarding the importation into the European Union of solar panels manufactured in China and the consumption of solar panel products in China. We document Chinese firms’ cumulative abnormal returns in response to this series of policy shocks and, importantly, how these responses varied by firm ownership and across the three different stock markets we examine.====We then examine the predictions of the Melitz (2003) model of firms engaged in international trade to explore the cross-sectional determinants of firms’ abnormal returns in response to trade policy announcements. We find broad support for the Melitz model’s predictions that the largest and most export-oriented firms will experience the largest proportional decline in expected future profits in response to an increase in a foreign trade restriction. We extend the analysis along a number of empirically-interesting dimensions. First, we incorporate the precise value chain position of the firm into our analysis of CARs. As the structure of global value chains has become more fragmented and complex, it has become more important to understand how a trade policy change against one output along a value chain impacts the value of firms along the chain. We find that stock market losses are largest for the more directly impacted value chain positions.====We next extend our analysis to firm ownership types and find that the stock prices of private sector firms in China are more responsive to trade and domestic policy announcements than state owned enterprises (SOEs); private sector firms are more likely to be adversely affected by trade restrictions than state owned enterprises and private sector firms gain more from domestic policy initiatives. Notably, we observe very little or no change in the cumulative abnormal returns of Chinese state owned enterprises (SOEs) to a policy change that threatened to seriously impair the firms’ access to 80% of the world market for solar panels and photo-voltaic cells. At a minimum, this suggests that SOEs are largely insulated from the fundamental market forces that drive the behavior of the Chinese private sector firms that they compete against. In finding very little or no response in the stock prices of SOEs to external trade policy shocks alongside negative abnormal returns for private sector firms, we provide suggestive evidence that the mechanism of resource (mis)allocation is tied to investors’ perceptions about the extent to which SOEs are invulnerable to market forces. Although the European Union’s trade policy actions were intended to “level the playing field” between European and Chinese firms, the policy seems to have had the unintended consequence of tilting the playing field within China against the Chinese economy’s private sector solar panel producers in favour of SOEs.====We conclude our analysis by using an instrumental variables approach to study the importance of the market in which a firm is publicly-listed. To the best our knowledge, ours is the first work to assess and compare the responses in different stock markets to the same set of events relevant to the firms listed within them. Interestingly, the prices of private sector Chinese solar panel firms listed on the US stock market are more responsive to trade and domestic policy shocks than those listed in Hong Kong or Shanghai-Shenzhen. This could perhaps be attributed to the fact that the US stock market participants are largely professional and institutional investors who use analytical tools and have real-time access to relevant market information, while in the Chinese market the majority of investors are private individuals.==== Taken together, these findings highlight that trade policy actions which are intended to foster a fairer competitive environment in global markets can potentially exacerbate underlying distortions in markets with heavy state involvement.====The present paper contributes to three literatures: (1) the literature on firm productivity and resource mis-allocation in China (Hsieh, Klenow, 2009, Hsieh, Song, 2015, Dollar, Wei, 2007); (2) the event-study literature (Breinlich, 2014, Moser, Rose, 2014, Hartigan, Perry, Kamma, 1986, Hughes, Lenway, Rayburn, 1997, Lenway, Morck, Yeung, 1996, Guzhva, Pagiavlas, 2004, Miyajima, Yafeh, 2007, Kutan, Muradoglu, Sudjana, 2012, Kosmidou, Kousenidis, Negakis, 2012); and (3) the literature on the impact of antidumping policy on exporters (Bown, Crowley, 2006, Bown, Crowley, 2007, Crowley, Meng, Song, 2018, Tabakis, Zanardi, 2016).====Our work builds upon a number of significant prior contributions in the event study literature. An important early study of the impact of special US import tariffs on stock market returns was conducted by Hartigan et al. (1986). More recent contributions on the impact of trade policy changes on stock market value include Breinlich (2014), Breinlich (2015), and Moser and Rose (2014). Breinlich (2014) examines the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the value of individual Canadian firms. Moser and Rose (2014) study the impact of signing a regional trade agreement on the returns in national stock markets. Ries (1993), on Japanese autos in the 1980s, and Hughes et al. (1997), on semiconductors, examine the impact of trade policy changes on upstream and downstream firms.====Recent contributions on evaluating externally-created policy shocks include Kutan et al. (2012) and Kosmidou et al. (2012). Kutan et al. (2012) examine the impact of IMF-related news on both financial and real sector stock returns in Indonesia during the Asian crisis, in particular, they explore the interplay between IMF actions in crisis countries and the actions and responses of local authorities. Kosmidou et al. (2012) test for the impact of the EU/ECB/IMF bailout programs on the financial and real sectors of the Athens Stock Exchange during the Greek sovereign crisis.====A number of prior studies on abnormal stock returns have focused on understanding the cross-sectional determinants of heterogeneous returns: Lenway et al. (1996) look at the U.S. steel industry, Guzhva and Pagiavlas (2004) study U.S. airlines after the September 11th terrorist attacks, and Miyajima and Yafeh (2007) examine Japanese non-financial companies around major events associated with the Japanese banking crisis of 1995–2000.====The next section describes the history of the Chinese solar panel industry, the EU antidumping case against Chinese photo voltaic (PV) producers, and Chinese government initiatives to stimulate the solar panel industry.

While offshoring in the car ==== has risen from 2000 to 2016, the top five offshoring brands account for half the car assembly relocated to low-wage countries. We show that the decision to offshore a particular car model depends on two types of cost (dis)advantage of the home country relative to foreign locations. The first type, the assembly costs common to all models, is estimated via a structural triadic gravity equation. The second effect, model-level comparative advantage, is an interaction between proxies for the model’s skill and capital intensity and headquarter country’s abundance in these factors.","Concern over the effects of offshoring on workers motivates a large body of empirical research. A prominent recent example is Pierce and Schott (2016), who attribute a large part of the decline in US manufacturing employment to the reallocation of production to China by US firms. They point out that the biggest increase in Chinese exports to the US following WTO accession was for foreign affiliates. Furthermore, WTO accession boosted the number of related-party import transaction in US imports. Hummels et al. (2018) survey the empirical literature about offshoring effects, and report substantial impacts of offshoring on rich countries’ labor markets, regarding both employment and wage inequality.====Which products are most vulnerable to the offshoring threat? While Blinder (2006) contends that “virtually all [manufacturing] jobs were potentially moveable offshore’,” Hanson (2015) finds that in reality even within manufacturing, offshoring is confined to a handful of sectors. In this paper we zoom in on one of those sectors, the car industry, to examine the country and variety-level characteristics that make offshoring more likely. One unsurprising factor promoting offshoring is sectoral cost competitiveness of the potential offshoring country. A second key factor is variety-level ==== between product factor intensities and country factor abundances. We investigate these hypotheses, exploiting exceptionally detailed data from the car industry.====Car makers have a long history of assembly in foreign countries: Ford of Canada began manufacturing operations in 1904. For the most part, the car industry, like other industries, has moved production abroad to obtain better access to foreign customers.==== Recently, there has been a rise in use of foreign assembly to serve markets other than just the host country. In 2010, with unions complaining that Renault had moved three quarters of its car production outside of France, then president Sarkozy summoned Renault’s CEO, Carlos Ghosn, to the Elysée Palace “to explain the carmaker’s strategy.” He was reportedly told to retain production of the Clio for the French market in France, rather than move it to the Renault plant in Turkey. Six years later 64% of the new generation Clios sold in France were produced in Turkey with the remainder in France. In March 2014 Porsche announced that it would move production of the Cayenne SUV from Germany to Slovakia. This would mark the first time that Porsches would be assembled in a poorer country than Germany.====Stories such as these suggest a major change in the pattern of auto assembly is under way. To what extent will auto production go the way of clothing and consumer electronics and migrate to less developed countries? This paper quantitatively investigates the state of offshoring in the passenger car industry. We propose two ways to measure the amount of offshoring of assembly and show that it is not growing as much as the anecdotes above suggest. Furthermore, offshoring for the home market is highly heterogeneous: the top five offshoring brands account for half of the cars made abroad and sold in the brands’ home market.====To explain the large observed variation in offshoring, we examine the country- and model-level determinants of the decision to assemble a particular model in a lower wage country. Our aim is to understand why offshoring takes place and in particular which firms find it attractive. The results we obtain support a simple comparative advantage model of offshoring. Firms based in countries that have relatively high assembly costs are more likely to offshore in general and the most likely models to be offshored are the less expensive cars of brands based in high income countries. We interpret price as a proxy for the skill and capital intensity of the model and per capita income as a proxy for abundance in the corresponding factors of production.====Why is offshoring in the car industry of particular interest? First of all, the car industry is large and considered important by government policy makers. Passenger cars are the largest expenditure category among goods.==== Industry associations in the European Union (EU) and United States (US) report very large employment shares for the broadly defined automotive sector. Including parts and other related activities, it accounts for 5.8% of the total employed population of the EU and nearly 5% of US employment. Car makers were deemed sufficiently important to receive $US 81 bn under both the Bush and Obama administrations. In January 2017, Donald Trump threatened General Motors with border taxes if it continued to make Chevrolet Cruzes intended for the US market in Mexico.====A second compelling reason to study offshoring in the car industry is the existence of extraordinarily rich data. IHS Markit, an automotive consultancy, provides a nearly exhaustive account where cars are made and then sold. Comparable data do not appear to be available on a worldwide basis for any other sector of the economy. Most government-provided data sets are restricted to parent firms or affiliates based in a single reporting country. IHS tracks the factories where over 2000 models are assembled by nearly all manufacturers and brands. The data, running from 2000 to 2016, shows annual flows at the level of individual models identifying location of assembly and country of sale (the data are based in part on new car registrations). Because we can map the origins of each brand back to a headquarters country (which we designate as the brand’s “home”), we capture the three essential locations that form part of our criteria for offshoring: where each brand makes the cars it sells in its brand home and other markets. Some important dimensions of the data include the following:====Using the auto data set, we conduct three main empirical exercises. The first step quantifies the magnitude and direction of offshoring to this date. By offshoring we mean the relocation of production intended for a given market to new assembly sites. Our narrow definition of offshoring focuses on the ==== market of the brand. The narrow definition of offshoring thus removes all relocation of production to get closer to foreign customers.==== Our broad definition considers all assembly outside the brand’s home country to be offshoring. In both cases, we define the home country to be the place where the headquarters of the brand is located. In cases such as Volvo where headquarters functions are mixed between countries (Sweden and China), the home country is defined based on where the brand was founded (Sweden). By direction, we distinguish “downward” offshoring to lower income countries from “flat” and “upward” offshoring to other countries at similar or higher income levels. Our threshold for flat is for the producing country per-capita income to be no more than 20% above or below the per capita income of the brand home.====After establishing that offshoring to serve the home market remains small and is mainly carried out by a small number of brands, we investigate the determinants of the decision to offshore all or part of the production of a car model. Drawing elements from Dornbusch et al. (1980) and Feenstra and Hanson (1997) we develop a simple model of the variety-level decision to offshore. The model is deliberately parsimonious, abstracting from dynamic aspects such as switching costs and the hysteresis they would induce. Our purpose is to formalize in a straightforward way the idea that products which are misfits in the brand’s home market are more like to be offshored. Our notion of “misfit” is a skill-intensive car model that is produced in a country where skilled workers are relatively scarce and hence relatively highly paid.====In addition to variety-level comparative advantage, a second driver of the decision to offshore is the general cost advantage of the home country in car assembly. To obtain the country-specific “assembly advantage” term, we first estimate a specification of multinational production (MP) flows derived from Arkolakis et al. (2018). This specification has origin-year and brand-destination-year fixed effects as well as measures of frictions between assembly country and market as well as headquarter and assembly country. Our paper is the first to estimate the triadic gravity regression for multinational production using data with the appropriate dimensions. In the model, the origin-year fixed effects are proportional to the ratio of worker productivity to their wages.====Our final exercise is to estimate a fractional logit on the share of production that is offshored at the model level. One previous study has also sought to identify the characteristics of vehicles that makes them more susceptible to offshoring: McCalman and Spearot (2013) examined the Post-NAFTA expansion of capacity to produce light trucks in Mexico. They found that US firms “offshored varieties that were older and less complex to produce.” We compare our worldwide car results to their North American trucking results.====The remainder of the paper consists of five sections. Section 2 documents the changes that occurred in worldwide production of cars over the 2000–2016 period. Section 3 then specifies our definitions of offshoring, and quantifies its extent and patterns over time and space. Our modeling of the offshoring decision and estimating equation are described in Section 4. The measurement of the different covariates involved in the offshoring regression is contained in Section 5, and Section 6 provides our estimates of the decision to produce their models in a country where costs are lower than at home.",Misfits in the car industry: Offshore assembly decisions at the variety level,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915831830159X,22 February 2019,2019,Research Article,119.0

In a difference-in-difference setting, we compare exporter characteristics in sectors intensive in intellectual property (IP) relative to non-IP-intensive sectors. We find that high-IP exports expanded along the extensive (firm-count) margin around the time of the reforms, but with the passage of time expansions along the intensive (firm size) margin took on more importance. Changes in the exporting behaviour of entrants were the key drivers, while incumbents were largely unaffected. Exporter entry and exit rates in IP-intensive sectors rose after the reforms, shifting the distribution of exporters towards larger and more IP-intensive firms. The first year survival rate of entrants was unaffected, but the destination entry rate of survivors fell. The findings signify that ==== reforms did influence local productive and innovative capacity of developing countries.","The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which came into effect on 1 January 1995, is the first agreement to include intellectual property rights (IPRs) provisions under the multilateral trading system. It sets down minimum standards of IPRs at a level that major industrialized countries provide and stipulates effective enforcement.==== The Agreement was designed to achieve universal standards of intellectual property (IP) laws, which necessarily required countries in the developing world—where IP protection had been notoriously weak or altogether absent—to strengthen their IPRs relatively more. Its acceptance is a compulsory requirement of WTO membership but depending on the level of economic development of the country concerned, WTO members were given different transitional periods to comply with the Agreement. As a result, several developing countries implemented substantial reforms of their patent systems during the 1994–2005 period in order to establish the strong standards mandated by the Agreement. These reforms expanded access to protection, broadened the types of inventions that were patentable (such as medicines and biotech-related inventions), increased the duration of protection, and in many cases, also reduced the scope for a loss of rights. Proponents of the Agreement argued that national IP reforms will accelerate the transfer and dissemination of technology into the developing world and promote developing countries’ industrial and technological development.====In this paper, we evaluate the impact of national patent reforms in 42 developing countries on the characteristics and dynamics of these countries’ exports. We use product-level data from 1997 to 2014 about the basic characteristics of exporters, the degree of firm diversification and market concentration, and the measures of exporter and destination dynamics. We find that high-IP exports expand when patent reforms occur in developing countries. The expansion in exports is primarily driven by a rise in the number of exporters (i.e., extensive margin) but over time, expansions in the (mean and median) size of exporters (i.e., intensive margin) become more important. This result is not driven by unobserved cross-country heterogeneity and obtains with equal strength when we study changes in exports that occur around the time of patent reforms.====We further find that the effect of patent reforms on the unit price per exporter takes time to appear: the unit prices do not change around the time of patent reform but grow more rapidly after reforms. The results also add new insights into how patent reforms are manifested in exporter behavior. Patent reforms are simultaneously creative and destructive: both exporter entry and exit rates in high-IP sectors rise around the enactment of patent reform, and these effects persist over time. However, exiting exporters tend to be of smaller size and have lower unit prices and so, as new IP-dependent firms are displacing existing firms, the distribution of exporters shifts towards larger and more IP-intensive firms. We further find that the observed effects of patent reforms on exports are driven by changes in the exporting behaviour of entrants, while the exporting behaviour of incumbents is largely unaffected. Patent reforms have no effect on the size of incumbents, their total export value, destination entry and exit rates, or market diversification. Likewise, patent reforms do not affect the first year survival rate of new entrants into export markets. But the destination entry rate of surviving entrants and the shares of new destinations in their total export value fall following patent reforms. We also find that exporter concentration in terms of the number of exporters per destination rises around the time of the reform, but this increase is driven by large destination markets and falls over time after reforms. Taken as a whole, our micro-level data and treatment analysis allow us to uncover a number of rich exporter and destination market dynamics.====Our analysis exploits the fact that not all developing countries had undertaken major reforms in their patent systems, and those that did enacted them in different periods. The variation in patent reforms across countries and years improves our identification and also enables us to study the changes in exporter behaviour that occur around the time of patent reform. Moreover, our product-level data allows us to distinguish IP-intensive ‘treated’ products from non-IP-intensive ‘control’ products and use variations in sensitivity to patent reforms across the two product groups to account for impacts common to all products within a country.====A key question is the issue of endogeneity in the adoption of patent reforms. Thriving exports in IP-intensive industries could very well provide an incentive for a developing country to reform its patent regime in the hope of fostering further exports. In this sense, IP-intensive exports cause patent reforms and not the reverse. While this is a valid concern, it is unlikely to apply here. The timing of patent reforms across developing countries in our data is most likely exogenous, since it largely coincides with the TRIPS compliance schedule. The WTO’s deadlines for complying with the TRIPS provisions differed across countries, but countries were limited in their ability to change their compliance schedule (Delgado et al., 2013). To further ease the endogeneity concern, we study the timing of patent reforms, following the approach in Branstetter et al. (2006). In order to increase the number of years prior to the date of reform, we use the UN Comtrade export data from 1990 to 2016 for this analysis. The estimated timing of export changes confirms that there is no pre-reform trend, suggesting that the endogeneity in the adoption of patent reforms is not an issue.====Patent reforms can impact exporter behaviour and dynamics through many channels. Three major channels are international trade in goods and services, FDI through multinational enterprises (MNEs), and the licensing of technology and intangible assets.==== Stronger IPRs promote developing countries’ imports of new goods and technological inputs as well as intra-firm technology transfer and arm’s length licensing, and the stock of knowledge available for local producers rises as a result. As firms learn from the operations of MNEs and the local technology pools, they develop new products and create platforms for exports (He and Maskus, 2012). Unintended spillovers of technological information and know-how from MNEs, which happen alongside with intentional technology transfer through market transactions, may also contribute to quality improvements and reductions in the production costs of export goods (Javorcik, 2004b, Lopez, 2008). Another important channel is appropriability hazards and the return to innovation. Stronger IPRs limit the risk of technology misappropriation and product imitation by rivals. Lower appropriability hazards may increase exporter survival and encourage incumbent firms to develop new product varieties destined for export markets or upgrade the quality of existing export goods (Amiti and Khandelwal, 2013). A final significant channel is the sunk cost of entry into export markets (Aw et al., 2011). With substantial foreign-market entry costs, a firm must earn a sufficient present value of the expected future export profit stream in order to begin to export. To the extent that stronger IPRs increase the economic returns of exporting and reduce uncertainty about future export profits, they impact the market entry strategy of firms facing entry costs and also affect expected future probabilities of exit.====There is already a considerable empirical literature examining the impact of strengthening IPRs in developing countries on technology transfer via exporting, foreign direct investment (FDI) or licensing.==== This literature has focused on inward technology flows into IP-reforming countries and ignored outward flows. The three exceptions are Branstetter et al. (2011), Briggs and Park (2014), and Yang and Maskus (2018). Branstetter et al. (2011) studied patent reforms in 16 countries (high and upper middle income economies) and focused on initial episodes of exports to the U.S. market. The paper finds that the number of product classes in which countries export increased in postreform years, which would be a consequence of new goods production by firms in the reforming countries. Briggs and Park (2014) also analyzed the effect of patent protection on the outward orientation of firms, but for the affiliates of U.S. multinational companies. More recently, Yang and Maskus (2018) examined the impact of patent rights on the exports of high-R&D products. The past literature’s focus on inward technology flows is not surprising, considering the limited postreform data available, compounded by the delayed impacts on developing countries’ innovation, product upgrading, and foreign market entry. More years of data since developing countries’ major patent reforms allow us to study the short-run and long-run impacts on the capacity of developing countries for exporting and their outward orientation.====Our paper contributes to the previous literature in that we explore the microfoundations of developing countries’ export growth. Understanding these impacts is particularly important given that the share of developing economies in world merchandise exports is large and growing.==== Similar to Branstetter et al. (2011), Briggs and Park (2014), and Yang and Maskus (2018), we focus on the outward orientation of patent-reforming countries but unlike these studies, we document export episodes at the firm, rather than country, level. Also, Branstetter et al. (2011) used data for the 1982–1999 period, which are mainly pre-TRIPS data, while we study the period of 1997–2014.====Our empirical strategy is a combination and an extension of the approaches adopted in the literature. As such we owe much to previous work. We consider a difference-in-difference setting that compares the export outcomes in the group of IP-intensive products relative to the control group of non-IP-intensive products to evaluate the impact of patent reforms. Our classification of the products into the two groups follows (Delgado et al., 2013). Our approach of interacting product IP-intensity with patent reforms is also akin to that of Yang and Maskus (2018), which adopts a generalized factor-proportions framework where industry research intensity is interacted with national PRs and the strength of national PRs is viewed as an exogenous institutional endowment affecting countries’ comparative advantage in R&D intensive goods. Our approach is also similar to that of Branstetter et al. (2006) in that we use interact the postreform dummy variable and a time trend that measures the number of years that have passed since the reform year in order to quantify the duration of effects after reform. In contrast to previous work, we specify the exponential model for the observed outcomes and estimate it using the non-linear Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) estimator proposed by Silva and Tenreyro (2006). We use this model to identify the multiplicative treatment effect which can be given a causal interpretation under the key assumption of a common time trend in a multiplicative form (Ciani and Fisher, 2018).====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our methodology. In Section 3, we describe our data on firm exporter behavior and dynamics, discuss our product classification, and outline our patent reform and other country data. Section 4 presents our results on export margins, exporter and destination dynamics, and the diversification and concentration of export destinations. We study the timing of patent reforms in Section 5, discuss our results in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.",Patent reforms and exporter behaviour: Firm-level evidence from developing countries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158318301461,March 2019,2019,Research Article,120.0

This paper distinguishes between trade in final goods and trade in parts to track the shifting pattern of the location of manufacturing. We introduce a simple empirical measure of comparative advantage in parts on one hand and in final goods on the other. We illustrate how this distinction can help organise thinking on the patterns of industrialisation and deindustrialisation—namely the ‘GVC journeys’ of advanced and emerging economies. We also provide one simple model. The model highlights the interactions of trade costs and the knowledge transfers to accompany offshoring of parts production and assembly, which we call trade-led versus knowledge-led globalisation.","Globalisation's advance is typically conceptualised as having been driven by falling trade costs. This could be called the trade-led conceptualisation of globalisation. This form of globalisation, which started in the early 1800s, was associated with the industrialisation of today's rich nations (say the G7 to be concrete) and the de-industrialisation, or non-industrialisation of all other nations. In tandem with this asymmetric industrialisation, income growth took off sooner and faster in the G7. The result was a massive increase in per-capita G7 incomes but a much less impressive increase in rest-of-world incomes. The result has been called the Great Divergence (Pomeranz, 2000). During this phase of trade-led globalisation, or what Baldwin (2006) calls globalisation's ‘first unbundling’ (unbundling of production and consumption), comparative advantage was conceptualised as being defined at the national level (Ricardo, 1817). This made perfect sense. The 19th century wave of globalisation and industrialisation boosted the industrial competitiveness of some nations, but not others. Lower trade costs in goods fostered manufacturing innovation and productivity advances in today's rich nations, and the new technologies stayed inside the nations, developing them. The best way to characterise the resulting rapid shift in industrial competitiveness was at the national level since technological capabilities tended to stay national. Some nations became, what we would today call, high-tech nations, while most did not and the resulting shift in competitiveness undermined industry in non-G7 nations. Quite simply, the stock of innovations that stayed in the G7 nations made it difficult for the G7 firms that owned the technology to apply it abroad.====A second phase of globalisation was launched by the ICT revolution that radically lowered the cost of moving knowhow across international borders. This made it much easier, safer, and more profitable for G7 firms that owned large amounts of manufacturing knowhow to combine some of their knowhow with low-cost labour in nearby developing nations. This new type of globalisation, which Baldwin (2006) called the ‘second unbundling’ (unbundling of factories), dramatically changed the nature of comparative advantage. This rise of international production—call it global value chains (GVCs for short)—fundamentally changed the nature of international competition. Before, globalisation meant nations exchanging the fruits of their nationally-defined comparative advantage. After, G7 firms could spread their technical knowledge across borders. In essence, the knowhow was always owned by firms rather than nations, but since communication was so difficult, it was an innocent assumption to conceive of technology differences being defined at the nation level. However, the ICT revolution undermined the innocence of this assumption. To put it differently, the new type of globalisation ‘denationalised’ comparative advantage, as noted by Baldwin, 2016, Jones, 2000 and many others. The firms' cost advantages are no longer organised solely according to national boundaries; GVC boundaries also matter. That is, the G7 firms retain control of its technology as they apply it to labour in non-G7 nations, and the resulting cost reduction boosts the G7 firm's competitiveness. Nowadays, the non-G7 nation's pattern of trade is no longer solely a national trait. It is a combination of national wages and firm-specific knowhow.====This new type of knowledge-led globalisation produced quite different outcomes for two very good reasons. First, knowledge tends to be non-rival, and thus cross-border flows of knowhow are more likely to spread something rather than exchange something. Second, the flows tend to be asymmetric given that knowhow is abundant in a handful of advanced economies and scarce everywhere else. The result was a rapid deindustrialisation of the G7 nations (but not the G7 firms) and a rapid industrialisation of a handful of formally poor nations that benefitted from the massive new knowledge flows. Firms from high-tech nations move the managerial, marketing, technical, organisation, and logistic knowhow within production networks that cross borders. For example, a US company can move some of its knowhow to a plant in Mexico, and thus comparative advantage is defined by the territory on which the US company is applying its knowhow. This phenomenon allows us to reconsider comparative advantage, which means the distinction between national and territorial comparative advantage. When ICT enables firms to move sources of comparative advantage across borders, the boundaries of comparative advantage are no longer purely national. To distinguish this shift from a more traditional change, we call this ‘territorial comparative advantage’ (TCA for short), while the traditional comparative advantage is called national comparative advantage (NCA for short).",GVC journeys: Industrialisation and deindustrialisation in the age of the second unbundling,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158318301503,18 February 2019,2019,Research Article,121.0

This suggests that the Japanese ""quantitative easing"" might have actually worked as a kind of a ""(localized) credit easing"" policy, and that a more targeted supply of reserves could augment its effectiveness.","At a near-zero interest rate, how do commercial loans react when banks are flooded with excess supply of reserves? This paper investigates this issue by utilizing a panel data on the balance sheets of Japanese banks. The result suggests that heterogeneity in the banks' reactions to supplies of excess reserves plays a crucial role in understanding the effectiveness of monetary policy at a near-zero interest rate.====In years that followed the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008, many central banks around the world have experimented with various versions of quantitative easing policies. To evaluate the impact of such policies, it is important to know the extent to which a massive injection of reserves to the banking sector ""leaks"" out of the financial market and starts circulating around the non-financial side of the economy. This is because it is widely believed that it is an increase in money stock, not monetary base per se, that could stimulate economic activities. However, such an investigation by researchers is often hindered by the shortness of the sample, as the policies have been implemented only recently in most countries.====Fortunately for economists (though perhaps unfortunately for most people who live there), Japan has experienced a prolonged period of near-zero interest rate. At the same time, in an effort to stimulate the economy under such a situation, the Bank of Japan (hereafter BOJ) has been experimenting with various versions of expansionary monetary policies. This has led to dramatic increases (and sometimes large contractions) in the supply of monetary base through the years. Japan thus provides an ideal ground for studying behaviors of private banks under such policies.====This paper studies a panel data of Japanese commercial banks. The data spans a long period of time, starting from the 1970s and ending in 2017, providing us enough data points to compare their behaviors both above and at the zero bound. Utilizing this source of information, in this paper, I ask how a bank reacts to an increase in reserves. Main findings of the paper are the following:====The last point is worth noting, as it suggests that a more targeted approach could be useful: that is, by injecting reserves primarily into those banks are more responsive to them, a central bank might be able to enhance effectiveness of its policy.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

More importantly it started to decline when it turned out that the 2% target would not be feasible in the short-run. This implies that an explicit inflation targeting needs to be a feasible one to anchor inflation expectations persistently.","In literature, a number of studies argued that an explicit inflation targeting regime provides less uncertainty about future inflation rates than a monetary policy regime without explicit numerical inflation target because it anchors expectations successfully (see, for example, Bernanke et al., [1999]) .==== However, the argument was based on an implicit assumption that the central bank can achieve the explicit inflation target appropriately. Thus it is far from clear whether the argument still holds true when the central bank faces a serious difficulty in achieving its explicit inflation target. Under prolonged deflation, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is a central bank that has adopted an explicit inflation target but faced a serious difficulty in achieving the target. The purpose of this paper is to explore to what extent the BOJ's explicit inflation target could anchor inflation expectations successfully under the special environments in Japan.====Soon after the BOJ announced the 2% inflation target in the consumer price index (CPI) in January 2013, the CPI inflation rate, which had stagnated below zero for a long time, rose substantially. In April 2014, it reached 1.5% when excluding fresh food but including energy and 0.8% when excluding food and energy. However, it started to decline in the latter half of 2014 when excluding the direct effects of consumption tax hikes. Reflecting oil price decline, it fell below zero in July 2015 when excluding fresh food but including energy. Even when excluding food and energy, it fell below zero in February 2017 (Fig. 1). It is thus likely that the role of the explicit inflation target might have faced substantial structural changes in anchoring inflation expectations in Japan.====To explore possible structural changes, the following analysis assumes that professional forecasters apply an expectations-augmented Phillips curve when they forecast macroeconomic variables in Japan.==== We then estimate panel Phillips curves by using Japanese forecaster-level data of “ESP Forecast” which is collected by Japan Center of Economic Research. ESP Forecast is a monthly survey on the macroeconomic outlook of Japan's economy including real GDP growth rate, core CPI inflation rate, yen-dollar exchange rate, and NY WTI crude oil futures price. Around 40 leading professional forecasters from private institutes in Japan participate in this survey. Estimating the panel Phillips curves for alternative periods, we derive how anchor of inflation expectations changed over time in Japan.====We find significant structural changes in how to form private inflation expectations. Before the BOJ announced the 2% inflation target, the estimated anchor of private inflation expectations was negative. But after the announcement, the new target increased the estimated anchor of inflation expectations significantly. This implies that the announcement of 2% target was successful in anchoring inflation expectations in positive values. However, the estimated anchor has never reached the target. More importantly it started to decline in 2015. It is likely that when it turned out that the 2% target would not be feasible in the short-run, Japanese forecasters came to place little weight on the 2% target in forming their inflation expectations. The result implies that an explicit inflation targeting regime can provide less uncertainty about future monetary policy actions only when it is a feasible target.====In literature, a number of studies used survey data of inflation expectations to examine whether the adoption of inflation targeting had helped to anchor inflation expectations. The results are mixed depending on whose inflation expectations were used in the analysis. Using survey data of firm managers and households, Kumar et al. (2015) found that the inflation expectations were not well anchored even in successful inflation targeting regime. In contrast, using survey data from Consensus Economics, Johnson, 2002, Johnson, 2003) showed that the expected inflation of professional forecasters was stabilized after the announcement of targets. Using the Consensus Economics data in Canada and the USA, Yetman (2017) found that an explicit inflation targeting regime provided for less uncertainty about future monetary policy actions to anchor expectations of professional forecasters.====The results are also mixed on the effects of BOJ's dramatic policy changes. Using the QUICK survey system data for market participants, Fujiwara et al. (2015) found no sizable difference in perceptions of CPI inflations before and after the introduction of new monetary policy regime. Using an event-study approach, Bundick and Smith (2018) demonstrated that unlike in the USA, forward measures of nominal compensation in Japan continued to drift with news about current inflation even after the Bank of Japan adopted the inflation target. In contrast, Fukuda (2015) showed that financial market expectations changed dramatically after Prime Minister Abe had announced a new monetary policy regime in late 2012. Using survey data from Consensus Economics, Hattori and Yetman (2017) found that after the BOJ announced the 2% inflation target, the estimated anchors across forecasters have tended to rise, along with the dispersion in estimates across forecasters. Our results partly support the view that the BOJ's policy changes increased the anchored inflation expectations significantly. However, they also suggest that their effects were far from satisfactory in achieving the target.====In most advanced economies, inflation targeting had originally been introduced as a device to stabilize inflation at low levels. However, when inflation remained weak persistently, the central bank must bring inflation up to the target. Using survey data across 10 advanced economies from Consensus Economics, Ehrmann (2015) showed that inflation expectations of professional forecasters were not well anchored under persistently low inflation but that they were better anchored in inflation targeting countries. Our results are consistent with his results in that the BOJ's 2% target could raise inflation expectations towards significant positive values. However, we find that the effect did not persist when the BOJ's commitment turned out to be unfeasible. Inflation expectations are likely to be influenced not only by the central bank's target inflation rate but by the public's confidence in the central bank's achievement of the target rate. In Japan, a number of structural problems still underpin chronic low inflation (See, for example, Nishizaki et al., [2014] and Hasumi et al., [2018]). Thus unless solving these structural problems, an explicit inflation targeting could not anchor inflation expectations persistently.====The paper proceeds as follows.

It employs a generalized variant of the Eaton–Kortum (2002) model, featuring multiple sectors, input-output linkages, ====, and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). It uses the results of an ==== ex post analysis of a related existing ====, the one between the EU and Korea, to approximate the expected reductions in the costs of NTBs. This approach yields long-run welfare effects for Japan of about 18 bn USD per year (0.31% of GDP) and of about 15 bn USD (0.10%) for the EU. On average, the agreement does not appear to harm third countries. 14% of the welfare gains inside the EPA stem from tariffs, the remaining 86% from NTB reform, and the services sector account for more than half. In the EU, value added in the agri-food sector goes up most, while in Japan the manufacturing and services sectors gain.","On July 17, 2018 the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EU-Japan EPA) was formally signed and the ratification process started. The EPA constitutes the largest free trade agreement (FTA) that both the EU and Japan have concluded so far, and it is likely to be of systemic relevance. Its conclusion is of strategic importance for both the EU and Japan in times of growing protectionism and unilateralism. In this paper, we provide a quantitative analysis of the trade and welfare effects of the forthcoming EU-Japan EPA. We employ what Ottaviano (2014) has called “New Quantitative Trade Theory”. More precisely, we rely on the model of Eaton and Kortum (2002), extended by Caliendo and Parro (2015), and generalized to include tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) by Aichele et al. (2016).====The text of the EU-Japan EPA contains 23 chapters and a long list of annexes. It covers classical issues of market access, including tariffs and quotas, but it also addresses non-tariff barriers to trade and ventures into regulatory cooperation. The details are spread over several hundreds of pages. Incorporating the gist of the agreement into a quantitative general equilibrium is a challenge.====The smaller issue relates to tariff reductions which can simply be taken from the text, even if the high level of aggregation needed in a quantitative model hides some interesting product-level variation. The parties have agreed to gradually phase out virtually all tariffs, often over rather long transition periods, and to increase certain quotas in agriculture. It is reasonable to completely eliminate the tariffs in the conducted counterfactual scenarios because Japan will eliminate 97% of tariffs within the next 15 years. The EU will liberalize 99% of its tariff lines for the Japanese goods by the end of the phasing in period. In the area of industrial tariffs, Japan has low or zero most-favored-nations (MFN) tariffs before the agreement; the EU’s tariffs on cars or motor cycles are more substantial. In contrast, Japan has stronger tariff protection in the agri-food sectors.====In contrast, how the EPA will affect NTBs is much harder to ascertain. We do not make educated guesses about the size and distribution of such sectoral changes in NTBs. Rather, our strategy is to ex-post estimate the effects of a ratified free trade agreement, the one between the EU and Korea, and take it as a proxy for the potential trade cost effects that might plausibly arise between the EU and Japan. According to the comprehensive study of Chowdhry et al. (2018), the EU-Japan EPA shares textual, contextual and substantive similarities with the EU-Korea FTA, which entered into force in 2011 and has been the subject of rigorous evaluation analysis; see CIVIC and ifo Institute (2017). Also, Dreyer (2018) documents important parallels between the EU-Japan EPA and the EU-Korea FTA. Indeed, both agreement share a common structure, and their provisions are often similar; sometimes, the wording is even identical. What is more, the structure of comparative advantage is relatively similar. Both agreements belong to a modern vintage of FTAs in that they cover additional policy areas (e.g. trade related investment measures, barriers in services trade, technical barriers, public procurement, or intellectual property).====For these reasons, we use ex post evidence on the effects of EU-Korea of the costs of NTBs effects as a proxy to form expectations about what the EU-Japan agreement might bring. This approach complements other studies which have used expert judgments on the expected size of NTB cost reductions. This data-driven strategy makes sure that our assumptions on trade cost savings meet a feasibility check. It is also fits very nicely into our quantitative framework. Since we can solve our simulation model in changes, we do not need to estimate the initial level of trade costs. Information about ==== is enough. The econometric ex post evaluation of the EU-Korea agreement provides us with just these data for a large number of goods and services sectors, and separately for EU and Japanese market access costs.====Several quantitative impact assessments with respect to the EU-Japan free trade agreement have been presented over the past years. We add to this literature in several ways. The EUâs Directorate General for Trade has published a quantitative study in 2010 conducted by Sunesen et al. (2010) that assesses the impact of bilateral barriers to trade and investment between the EU and Japan. The assumed trade cost shocks are mainly informed by expert judgments, while we employ a data-driven approach. A second analysis of an EU-Japan free trade agreement is presented by Benz and Yalcin (2015). The contribution of this paper is to account for the importance of intra-industry trade in a quantitative (Melitz, 2003) model extended by a search-matching framework of the labor markets. Clearly, there are differences not only in bilateral trade barriers but also in how efficient the EU and Japanese labor markets work. The new and important aspect of this study is the modeling of the different labor markets in the considered economies. The analysis adopts a single-sector perspective and features only three countries (EU, Japan and the Rest of the World).====A third report has been carried out by European Commission (2016). Different from Benz and Yalcin (2015) and our approach, results rely a lot on dynamic gains from trade, where substantial uncertainties pertaining to model choice and calibration exist, so that the effects are likely to define upper bounds. Further, the European Commission recently published an economic impact assessment of the EPA by applying a recursively dynamic applied general equilibrium model. The implemented trade shocks of the counterfactual scenarios consist of tariff and non-tariff reductions. Tariffs are reduced according to the observable tariff lines of the EPA. Further, the authors qualitatively assess the potential reduction of technical barriers to trade (TBTs) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPSs) by conducting the negotiation achievements in each of the sectors (see European Commission, 2018).====A recent study of Lee-Makiyama (2018) provides in depth information on the relationship between the EU and Japan and offers information about the existing potential for growth and prosperity in both regions once the EPA is completely implemented. The author substantiates the existing potential for both trading areas for investments and sales abroad and the concomitant diversification and thus lowering of risks, once easier access is granted to each of these stable market environments. There is a also a quantification conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan (2017). Their CGE model considers TFP increased by trade liberalization, labor supply in response to real wage and capital accumulation by investment. Again, given the reliance on dynamic gains from trade, the results may identify upper bounds. Finally, Kawasaki (2017) uses the GTAP model to measure the impact under the assumption that tariff rates go to zero immediately and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) are reduced by 50%.====All those studies require information on the initial size of NTBs for all sectors around the world and depend on expert judgment in determining the size of NTB cost reductions for simulations. In contrast, our approach draws on an ex post evaluation of the EU-Korea agreement. Notwithstanding different modeling philosophies, it turns out that many of the qualitative predictions of earlier work are quite comparable to our findings. We find that the largest gains for Europe are to be found in the agri-food sector, while in Japan various manufacturing sectors are bound to benefit most followed by services. However, we document several novel results: First, the ex post evaluation of the EU-Korea agreement shows that EU market opening has been less substantial than that of its Asian partner, and quite heterogeneous across sectors. Second, our results suggest that transplanting these results in our simulations, in absolute terms Japan and the EU reap very similar welfare gains, but relative to the baseline, Japan’s gains are three times as large as Europe’s. Third, we find that the structure of Japanese regional value chains changes as firms source more from Eastern Europe but less from ASEAN countries. Fourth, we report a substantial degree of heterogeneity between different EU members and Japan in terms of overall welfare gains and their origin. Italy is bound to benefit more than Germany due to gains in agri-food and fashion. Finally, the Brexit reduces the value of the EPA to Japan by about 20%; the implementation of the Transpacific Partnership agreement, in turn, has little importance.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methodological framework. Section 3 discusses the main data sources. Section 4 explains the empirical estimation method and discusses the gravity results. Based on the defined EU-Japan scenarios, we examine general equilibrium consistent results on trade and welfare in Section 5.

At the same time, many other Japanese macroeconomic indicators deteriorated, including the rate of inflation. In response to this weakening of the economy, in January 2016 the Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided to adopt a negative interest rate policy (NIRP), following the example set by the European Central Bank (ECB) and three other European central banks. In line with this policy, the BOJ began charging a fee of 0.1% on reserves held on behalf of private financial institutions, while after September 2016 the BOJ also began to control the term structure of interest rates, such that there was a zero yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds. In July 2018, the BOJ modified its target on 10-year government bonds yields to allow lower and upper bounds ranging roughly from a minimum of –0.2% to a maximum of 0.2%.====As it has only been about two-and-a-half years since the BOJ introduced the NIRP, it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions on its effectiveness given the small sample size of the necessary data. However, this does not lessen in any way the urgent need on the policy side to evaluate the effectiveness of this important policy tool. Problematically, the NIRP is an unprecedented macroeconomic policy with little supporting economic theory or empirical evidence. The purpose of this paper is to propose a simple analytic model to understand its logical reasoning, and to provide a preliminary report on the effects of the NIRP as recently introduced by the BOJ on the Japanese economy. Our tentative conclusion is that the NIRP has empirically observable expansionary effects. It, therefore, serves as a legitimate policy tool in alleviating zero-interest rate lower bounds, notwithstanding some potential negative side effects.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In particular, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003b) and Jung et al. (2005) analyze optimal monetary policy in situations in which a central bank is limited in terms of reducing the policy interest rate, and conclude that an optimal commitment policy is the most effective.==== Such a commitment policy can reduce the real interest rate and stimulate the economy by controlling inflation expectations. Their conclusions, however, fully depend on two important assumptions, i.e., rational expectation formation and optimal commitment monetary policy. The role of inflation expectations can be very different depending on the type of monetary policy a central bank implements. Moreover, the effectiveness of monetary policy can also vary widely depending on how inflation expectations are formed.====Particularly in Japan, as Kuroda (2017) noted, inflation expectations are important in monetary policy, since inflation expectations have been trapped at a low level by prolonged deflation. To escape from the liquidity trap and mitigate this situation, the Bank of Japan introduced an inflation target policy under the Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE) Policy in April 2013. In terms of anchoring inflation expectations, Kuroda (2017) states: “In practice, QQE has produced its intended effects. Inflation expectations climbed notably after the introduction of QQE. This demonstrates that a strong determination by the central bank pushes up people’s forward-looking inflation expectations.” Thus, the Bank of Japan was partially successful in anchoring inflation expectations.==== Moreover, whether inflation expectations are anchored to a target level or not remains a central issue in the implementation of monetary policy. In terms of inflation expectation formation, Kuroda (2017) emphasizes: “The rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) recently has been around 0% and there is still a long way to go until the price stability target of 2% is achieved. [....] Analysis by the Bank of Japan suggests that, as a result of prolonged deflation, the backward-looking, or adaptive, component in the formation of inflation expectations continues to be much stronger in Japan than in Europe and the United States.” Thus, how inflation expectations are formed is also an issue crucial to monetary policy in Japan.==== This paper introduces these issues into a model and evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy.====In this paper, we relax the assumption of a purely forward-looking rational expectation and show the role of expectation formation in a liquidity trap under a standard New Keynesian model. We assume two states in expectation formation. First, we change the degree of how much expectations are anchored. Some papers argue that inflation expectations are well anchored under an inflation targeting policy. Beechey et al. (2011) show that long-run inflation expectations in the euro area are well anchored, while in the United States, the expected inflation rate is not firmly anchored. Such a difference derives from the ECBs communication strategy in which a goal of price stability is specified by setting a target inflation rate. Using survey data of the inflation expectations for 36 developed and developing countries, Davis (2014) argues that inflation expectations tend to be anchored for periods after the introduction of an inflation targeting policy. We describe this situation simply by fixing a fraction of expected inflation at a target level. Second, we change the degree of how much expectation formation is forward-looking, and describe it by assuming that expectations depend on a weighted average between rational expectation and a current inflation rate. Numerical simulations reveal how these different expectation formations change the effects of monetary policy in a liquidity trap.====Moreover, we also relax the assumption of optimal commitment policy. In addition to optimal commitment policy, we introduce two realistic monetary policy rules; i.e., the Taylor rule, and a simple rule with price-level targeting.==== Several papers (e.g., Smets, Wouters, 2003, Smets, Wouters, 2007), assume a Taylor rule to fit a theoretical model to data. Regarding a simple rule with price-level targeting, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003b) and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003a) reveal that this rule is very effective in a liquidity trap due to history-dependent monetary easing. They argue that a price-level targeting policy is a simple and realistic rule for replicating a feature of optimal monetary policy.====We obtain significantly different outcomes according to monetary policy rules in numerical simulations. Under an optimal commitment policy, the effect of monetary policy does not change markedly with different expectation formations for an inflation rate. One reason why is that optimal monetary policy includes a feature of history-dependent easing, and so there can be considerable management of expectations even though there is little leeway for this. Thus, the role of expectation formation for an inflation rate is not so important for optimal monetary policy.====On the other hand, under the Taylor rule, reductions in an inflation rate and the output gap for some periods at first become sufficiently smaller, as the degree to which inflation expectations are anchored becomes stronger. This also holds true as the degree of forward-lookingness in expectation formation become stronger. The Taylor rule does not involve a history-dependency, and does not work on expectations in a forward-looking model. Thus, anchored expectations and forward-looking expectations compensate for a drawback of the Taylor rule. In a forward-looking economy, there is an innate mechanism to realign the economy to a steady state when a negative shock disappears. Thus, when the degree of forward-lookingness decreases, this mechanism weakens and the economic slowdown can be severe. The role of expectation formation is non trivial under the Taylor rule.====A simple rule with price-level targeting can mitigate large drops in inflation rate and output gap. As explained in previous papers analyzing monetary policy in a liquidity trap, this is because targeting a price level gives a policy maker control of expectation formation by promising future monetary easing, as in the optimal commitment policy. This remains effective, even though there is limited room for managing expectations. Moreover, unlike the Taylor rule, the inflation rate and output gap become less sensitive to expectation formations. Thus, the role of expectation formation is not so serious a problem for a simple rule with price-level targeting.====Moreover, we show that whether or not the economy is in a liquidity trap is critical when considering the different roles that inflation expectations play in different monetary regimes by running simulations without the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate. We observe a larger difference for monetary policy effectiveness under different expectation formations in a liquidity trap. However, the output gap and inflation rate drop less when we do not assume a liquidity trap.====We estimated to what degree expectations are anchored to a targeting level, and to what degree expectation formation is forward-looking in the Japanese economy. In Japan, expectations have been partially anchored since the Bank of Japan introduced a price stability target of 2% in January 2013. Moreover, expectation formation is not perfectly forward-looking, but depends on the present inflation rate, which implies adaptive expectation. However, even in the Japanese case, expectation formation is not a topic discussed in monetary policy, regardless of whether or not expectations are anchored, or if the Bank of Japan can implement an optimal commitment policy. Optimal monetary policy with strong history-dependent easing can control expectation formation in the Japanese economy.====Under the Taylor rule, compared to a perfectly anchored case, we observe drops in the inflation rate and output gap for other expectation formations. However, these drops are largely mitigated when inflation expectations are partially anchored. Thus, even under a weak anchoring of inflation expectations, the Taylor rule can mitigate serious deflation. The drops are larger in the case in which inflation expectations are based on the current inflation rate compared to where inflation expectations are partially anchored. Moreover, by committing to a simple history-dependent rule like a price-level targeting rule, the Bank of Japan can further mitigate the effect of weak anchoring for expectations and a lack of forward-lookingness in expectation formation.====Our paper is related to two strands in the literature. First, it is related to studies of the optimal monetary policy in a liquidity trap. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003b) and Jung et al. (2005) analyze the optimal commitment policy in a liquidity trap, and show that a central bank needs to continue a zero-interest-rate policy even after the natural rate turns positive. Adam, Billi, 2006, Adam, Billi, 2007 and Nakov (2008) analyze the optimal commitment policy and discretionary policy in a liquidity trap under a stochastic shock.==== Our paper relaxes the assumption of forward-looking rational expectation in these papers and analyzes the role of expectation formation in a liquidity trap.====Second, our paper is related to the formation of expected inflation with empirical assessment and a forward-guidance puzzle. Recently, the sluggish response of an expected inflation rate was described with the New Keynesian model. Coibion, Gorodnichenko, 2012, Coibion, Gorodnichenko, 2015 show the state of a sluggish response in an expected inflation rate using the U.S. survey data. Pfajfar and Žakelj (2018) introduce the expectation formation based on a laboratory experiment into the New Keynesian model, and analyze the design of monetary policy when the expectations are not perfectly rational.==== Wiederholt (2014) and Andrade et al. (2015) build a model that includes the sluggish response of an expected inflation rate by extending the New Keynesian model with a heterogeneous belief. Some papers focus on expectation formation to solve the forward-guidance puzzle identified by Del Negro et al. (2012). They show that forward guidance is unrealistically powerful in the New Keynesian model. For example, Andrade et al. (2015) show that pessimistic expectations weaken the effects of forward guidance. Our paper is related to these in focusing on the effects of expectation formation on monetary policy and economic dynamics.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we define expectation formation and show the empirical evidence. We set up the model in Section 3. Section 4 shows numerical results for expectation formation of an inflation rate. In Section 5, we calibrate a model for the Japanese economy, and show the effects of expectation formation on monetary policy in Japan.

They pay little attention to how monetary policy influences firms’ incentive regarding R&D investment, which is a main driver of long-run economic growth. In this study, we consider the possibility that monetary easing induces adverse long-run effects on real economic activity by discouraging creative destruction. To this end, we construct a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that embeds both Schumpeterian and New Keynesian features: endogenous growth due to creative destruction and sticky prices due to menu costs, respectively. Then, we conduct a numerical simulation with the model calibrated to the U.S. economy to compute the stationary equilibrium and transition paths when transitory monetary easing shocks hit the economy.====Our model illustrates a tradeoff between the short-run positive effects and long-run negative effects of a transitory monetary easing shock. On the one hand, monetary easing increases the level of consumption due to price stickiness. Although the fraction of price-revising firms increases endogenously, thus partially offsetting the real effect of the monetary easing shock, monetary policy is not neutral. Because an increasing number of firms exit over time, the density of marginal firms that would subsequently revise their prices is relatively low. This non-uniform firm distribution reduces the increase in price-revising firms in response to the monetary easing shock. Therefore, the increase in the extensive margin does not completely eliminate the real effect, yielding a positive short-run effect.====On the other hand, inflation due to monetary easing reduces the reward for innovation via menu cost payments. As monetary easing increases marginal costs, firms incur more menu cost payments because they need to make price changes more frequently. This increase in menu cost payments decreases potential entrants’ values and, thus, sacrifices their innovations. This Schumpeterian feature combined with menu costs violates the super-neutrality of money even in the long run. The monetary easing lowers the frequency of creative destruction (product substitution) and, in turn, the growth rate of consumption.====According to a numerical simulation calibrated to the U.S. economy, we find that the latter adverse effect dominates the former positive effect in the long run. A 1==== transitory monetary easing shock for a quarter (a weekly 0.03% point increase in the money growth rate) boosts the level of consumption by 0.05% in the short run but dampens it by 0.07% permanently.====Our study is also motivated by the debate regarding long-run monetary neutrality, that is, whether an exogenous and permanent change in the level of the monetary aggregate has an effect on the level of output in the long run. Among a number of empirical studies, Fisher and Seater (1993) propose a simple method to address this question. Using the ordinary least squares method, they regress the equation ==== where ==== and ====, and ==== represent the lag operator, real output, and the monetary aggregate, respectively. Under some conditions, it is shown that ==== converges to the long-run derivative of output with respect to money, ==== for ==== → ∞, where ==== represents a monetary shock. Thus, long-run monetary neutrality is rejected if the estimate of ==== is significantly different from zero. Fisher and Seater (1993) and subsequent work by Coe and Nason (2004) find evidence against long-run monetary neutrality for the United States, Germany, Australia, and Canada. To see if their results hold for Japan, we adopt the same approach using Japanese data, although we estimate the model separately for the periods of 1885–1940 and 1955–2015 because no data exists between 1941 and 1954.==== Table 1 shows the estimates of ==== for ==== years. For 1885–1940, this estimate is negative at the ten percent significance level for ==== whereas, for 1955–2015, it is positive at the five percent significance level for high ====’s. Thus, long-run monetary neutrality seems to be rejected. Although the sign of the estimate of ==== is inconclusive, this result is actually coherent with our model prediction shown in the top left-hand panel of Fig. 1, where the growth rate of money has both positive and negative effects on the firm entry-exit rate and, in turn, on the long-run level of real output, depending on the state of the economy.====Theoretically, our study is related to the following three strands of the literature. The first strand concerns menu cost models. As in Golosov and Lucas (2007), Nakamura and Steinsson (2010) and Midrigan (2011), we solve a dynamic optimization problem numerically and simulate the effects of monetary policy. Although Caplin and Spulber (1987) find the neutrality of monetary policy in a simple menu cost model, this result can be reversed by simply introducing the entry and exit of firms, because the firm distribution is non-uniform.====Second, our model of creative destruction is based on Grossman and Helpman (1991), where firm entry and exit are endogenous. Firms enter the market by inventing a new product that is superior in quality to the previous one, and a firm producing an older version of the product exits. The growth rate of the real economy is determined endogenously. With this endogenous growth setting, we can consider a reallocation from old firms to new firms with better qualities or productivities. Since the long-run negative effect of monetary easing mainly comes from dampening creative destruction by potential entrants, monetary easing works as a bailout for incumbents. Although the incumbents are solvent (and, thus, are not “zombies”) in our model,==== a reallocation through creative destruction with an appropriate frequency is desirable for social welfare. Acemoglu et al. (2018) extend Lentz and Mortensen (2008) to investigate the effects of subsidies on the incumbents’ R&D and the entrants’ R&D separately and find that the former reduces the overall growth rate. Our study implies that monetary easing has a similar effect under price stickiness because it increases the incumbents’ survival rate through a decline in the entry rate.====The third strand of the literature is a combination of the above two model types. The importance of product substitution (turnover) has been pointed out by Bils and Klenow (2004), Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) and Bils (2009), who examine price developments at a micro level. Despite the importance of product substitution, to the best of our knowledge, no theoretical study exists on the effects of frequent product substitution on inflation and the real aggregate economy. To understand these effects, our study examines the entry and exit of firms and price stickiness in combination. A deterministic version of our model is extensively studied both analytically and numerically in Oikawa and Ueda (2018b). Chu and Cozzi (2014) use a model with creative destruction and money but without a form of price stickiness, such as menu costs.====This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the basic setup of the model, and Section 3 provides the analytical results of two simplified models: an exogenous firm entry/exit model and a deterministic model with endogenous entry.

It is also found that the effect of agricultural workers share is significant for some people not considering migration, suggesting that inter-regional immobility affects their trade policy preferences.","Building a consensus for advancing trade liberalization among people is difficult, as the experiences of many countries show. Views on trade policies are different because trade liberalization does not equally benefit all people. In particular, regional heterogeneity of individuals’ trade policy preferences is revealed in elections. For instance, in Japan, although public opinion polls indicate that the majority is in favor of free trade, statistics reveal that 20%–30% of the population, mainly in local areas, objects free trade policies. The common perception is that people engaged in the agricultural sector oppose free trade because of its long history of government protectionism.==== However, as the agricultural industry contributes to only 1% of the total GDP and the agricultural workforce is only 3% of the total,==== the agricultural population is not the major dissenting one. It is thought that the non-agricultural dissenters object to further trade liberalization for the fear of being indirectly affected by a declining regional economy. If this is the case, in addition to individuals’ labor market attributes, such as education and industry affiliation, which have been examined by previous studies, regional characteristics are likely to be correlated with people's preferences for trade policy. Regardless of whether people work in the agricultural sector and whether they are currently employed or retired, people might be more likely to support protectionism if they reside in a region with a high share of agricultural workers. The significant effect of regional factors could correspond to the inter-regional immobility of workers, which has not been explicitly analyzed in literature. This study focuses on the role of these local characteristics in determining trade policy preferences.====Based on the predictions of the standard trade theory, previous studies at the individual level have focused on the role of labor market attributes in determining trade policy preferences (Scheve and Slaughter, 2001, Beaulieu, 2002a, Mayda and Rodrik, 2005, Blonigen, 2011, Blonigen and McGrew, 2014, Jäkel and Smolka, 2017). They examined whether individuals’ labor market attributes, such as education or industry affiliation, could explain their trade policy preferences, and found a correlation between individuals’ labor market attributes and trade policy preferences.==== In addition, it is also shown that some other variables, which have not been considered by conventional trade theory, had a strong correlation with trade policy preferences. For example, Scheve and Slaughter (2001) and Blonigen (2011) reported significant asset effects on trade policy preferences. They hypothesized that people who reside in a region wherein comparatively disadvantaged industries are dominant are likely to face negative demand shocks in the housing market after trade liberalization. Therefore, it is foreseen that housing prices would decline in these areas. Their results indicate that homeowners tend to support trade protection more as the level of concentration of comparatively disadvantage sectors increases in their regions. Moreover, this result suggests that not only individual characteristics, but also regional factors influence trade policy preferences. However, the literature on the origins of protectionism has not yet focused on the direct relationship between regional characteristics and individuals’ trade policy preferences.====This study empirically examines the association between regional factors and people's trade policy preferences by using survey data of 10,816 individuals selected from the general population across Japan. The survey data have several advantages over previous studies using survey data at the individual level. First, labor market attributes are enriched compared to previous studies. For example, the survey succeeds in collecting the data on annual income at the individual level which is more detailed information than the data used in previous studies. In addition, the data contain various attributes in terms of labor market; industry affiliation, occupation type, employment type. Second, the data cover 72% municipalities in Japan and enable us to examine cross-regional variation in trade policy preferences. The survey was conducted so that the proportions of 10 regions and 12 age groups approximating those for the whole of Japan as reflected in the most recent national population census. The respondents located throughout Japan are expected to represent approximately one out of ten thousand of Japan's total population. Finally, the uniqueness of the data is that the survey includes unprecedented question items to measure the extent of individuals’ inclination of migrating and changing jobs. These items enable to control for inter-regional mobility and inter-sectoral mobility of production factors. We use the ordered choice model to determine the probability of supporting import restrictions. The main results of this study are threefold. First, trade policy preferences are heterogeneous depending on the region even after controlling for labor market and non-economic attributes. Individuals residing in a region with a high share of agricultural workers tend to support a protectionist trade policy even if they do not engage in that sector. Second, for people who plan to continue to reside in the region, the probability of supporting a protectionist trade policy increases as the proportion of agricultural workers increases. However, there is no correlation between the probability of supporting a protectionist trade policy and the regional agricultural worker share for people considering migration. These results suggest that inter-regional immobility affects individuals’ trade policy preferences.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an empirical framework to explain the probability of choosing trade policy preferences and describes data on trade policy preferences. Section 3 presents the results from the ordered logistic regression.

Based on the estimated relationship between health and work status among individuals in their 50s, this study simulates these individuals’ work capacities in their 60s and early 70s. The simulation results reveal a large additional work capacity among the elderly as well as the possibility of some shift from part-time to full-time jobs among the male elderly. This study further observes that the elderly's additional work capacity has increased over the past 30 years along with the improvement of health status, although health conditions still prevent some individuals from working. The results underscore the need for policy measures to utilize the extra work capacity of the elderly.","A shrinking labor force along with large fiscal deficits presents an urgent challenge for many developed countries. The main driving force behind these two serious concerns is the rapid pace of population aging, which dampens labor force participation (LFP) with continued low fertility and expands fiscal deficits under a pay-as-you-go public pension program. A natural and simultaneous solution to these two policy challenges is to encourage the elderly to continue working as long as possible in terms of age. Thus, the main apparent target of recent pension reforms has been to raise the pensionable age, although pension reforms address various aspects, such as coverage, adequacy, sustainability, and work incentives (OECD, 2017). In fact, many developed countries have implemented or will execute public pension reforms to extend the pensionable age.====Although the LFP rate in Japan is higher than in most developed countries, there have been many policy debates on increasing the pensionable age (Oshio et al., 2018). Recently, Japan has been extending the pensionable age. For male pensioners, the eligibility age for the flat-rate benefit of the Employees’ Pension Insurance (EPI) program has increased by one year every three years, rising from 60 years of age in 2001 to 65 years in 2013. Furthermore, the eligibility age for the EPI wage-proportional benefit is scheduled to increase by one year every three years from 2013 to 2025, in order to reach 65 years at the end of this period. For female pensioners, while keeping a five-year lag relative to that for men, the eligibility age for the flat-rate benefit was raised in 2006, and that for the wage-proportional benefit was raised in 2018 in the same manner (Oshio et al., 2011).====However, it is possible that a simple extension of the pensionable age may not work, because not all older adults are able to work regardless of whether they are willing to do so. In particular, a major constraint on working is health, either physical or mental, which may also be associated with a decline in cognitive functions. In this context, a simple extension of the pensionable age, which ignores heterogeneity among the elderly, may result in increased inequality between healthy and unhealthy individuals and exacerbate the overall living standard of the elderly. Hence, a major concern to be addressed is whether elderly workers are healthy enough to work longer.====This study estimates the additional health capacity of the elderly to work in Japan and its long-term trend over the past 30 years (i.e., between 1986 and 2016), which provides the first such evidence to the best of our knowledge. This study relies on Cutler et al. (2013) model (referred to as the CMR model hereafter), a study that estimates the work capacity of the elderly in the United States. Questioning the results if people with a given level of health worked as long as they could, the CMR model simulates the work capacity of the age group entitled to receive social security benefits based on the estimated association between the health and work status of the age group immediately below the eligibility age.====Based on simulation results, Cutler et al. (2013) conclude that the elderly's work capacity is substantial. The CMR model implicitly assumes that the relationship between the health and work statuses of age groups below the eligibility age is stable and holds for the age group above the eligibility age. Correspondingly, any simulated decline in work given the same level of health status is attributable to factors other than health deterioration, particularly to social security benefits. Using this model commonly, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) International Social Security Project finds a substantial slack of work capacity among the elderly in 12 developed countries (Wise, 2017), including Japan (Usui et al., 2017).====Motivated by the need to provide empirical evidence for prevailing policy debates on the enhancement of the elderly LFP in Japan, we extend the analysis in the NBER project, which mainly aims to compare the degrees of health capacity to work across different countries in the same specification, in four aspects. First, we used a large-scale dataset obtained from the nationwide, population-based survey “Comprehensive Survey of the Living Conditions” (CSLC), which was conducted and released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of the Japanese Government. The current study uses data collected from the household and health datasets of the 2016 CSLC, along with its 1986 and 2001 surveys. By comparison, Usui et al. (2017) use the pooled observations from the first to third waves of the Japanese Study on Aging and Retirement (JSTAR), which collected data from ten municipalities in total in November 2007. The number of observations in the 2016 CSLC used in our statistical analysis is 197,004, about 19 times as large as the 10,351 person-year observations used in Usui et al. (2017), increasing the reliability of our estimates.====Second, when applying the CMR model, this study considers the characteristics of the elderly LFP in Japan. As a benchmark analysis for assessing overall work capacity, this study first divides work status into “work” and “no work,” and focuses on the elderly's choice between these two options. Then, this study expands the analysis by dividing work into “full-time” and “part-time,” motivated by the fact that a substantial portion of Japanese male employees shift to part-time work after retiring from their primary full-time work rather than completely abandoning the labor force (Shimizutani, 2011, Shimizutani and Oshio, 2010).====Third, this study examines the long-term trend of the health capacity to work over the past thirty years using data from the CSLC conducted in 1986, 2001, and 2016. Considering the improving trend of elderly health together with a wider coverage of public pension programs, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the additional work capacity has increased over the past 30 years.====Lastly, this study examines the distribution of work capacity among the elderly. Even if verified, a high health capacity to work among the elderly would not directly support an increase in the age of mandatory retirement or eligibility for pension benefits. As there may be a portion of people who are not able to work due to health conditions, policies should address heterogeneity among the elderly. This study thus examines the distribution of the expected probabilities of work and estimates the proportion of those who are unable to work due to health conditions.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

First, we find that the pro-cyclical relationship between wage and business cycle has weakened among low-income earners after the late 1990s, despite the fact that wages of low earners had been vulnerable to the business cycle fluctuations before this period, using the Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux decomposition method. Second, our empirical analyses using the DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux decomposition method confirm that the change contributed to mitigating wage inequality among employed people in the subsequent recessions such as the 2008 global financial crisis. This could be explained by the structural changes in Japanese employment system triggered by the financial crisis in 1997, which turned firms’ attitude towards downsizing more aggressive than before. This change affected mainly low-income earners who tend to belong to the secondary segment, while the wages and job security of the high-wage workers who mainly belong to the primary segment have stayed stable even after the structural changes. As a result, employment adjustment has dominated wage adjustment for the low-income earners after the change in the employment practice, which led to the results found in this study.","The Japanese employment system changed drastically in the late 1990s. Particularly, the year 1997, with the financial crisis following the Asian currency crisis in July, was a turning point in Japans labor market (Kimura, Ueda, 2001, Genda, 2004, Noda, Hirano, 2013, Kuroda, Yamamoto, 2003, Kuroda, Yamamoto, 2014, Kodama, Inui, Kwon, 2015). After that, the number of non-standard workers increased drastically, and firms became less negative toward downsizing. Since then, announcements of job cuts have not necessarily been judged as negative indicators of the firms management by the stock market.====Although the changes in the labor market have been widely discussed, little is known about their impact, aside from a few exceptions. For example, Kambayashi and Kato (2017) find that the job retention rate of male workers with less-education and/or short-term employment became lower in the late 1990s. Yokoyama et al. (2018) also describe that after the late 1990s, firms are likely to adjust non-regular workers to absorb exogenous shocks and to insulate regular workers from these shocks in an uncertain business environment. Kimura and Ueda (2001) and Kuroda, Yamamoto, 2003, Kuroda, Yamamoto, 2014 have examined wages during this period from a macro-level perspective in the context of Japanese deflation. However, the impact of the change in employment practices on the wage distribution and wage inequality is under-explored.====This study investigates the extent to which this change in employment practices affected wages. First, we reveal what happened to wage determination and wage inequality after 1997 compared with the previous years scenario. In addition, we examine the wage response to the business cycle by quantile of the wage distribution, especially to predict how wage inequality will change during recessions and booms. In this study, we can explain the observed facts based on Japan’s segmented labor market by using micro-level data, which makes this study different from those that use macro-level data.====To confirm the wage response to the business cycle, we use a comprehensive government dataset that contains relatively long-term time series wage data from 1989 to 2013. Using the data with sufficient business cycle variations makes it possible to explore the topic examined herein. Note that if there was no change in the business cycle, we could not estimate the relationship between the business cycle and wages. However, our data also include important events from the past 25 years: the post-bubble period in the 1990s, the structural change in the labor market in the late 1990s, the economic recovery in the mid-2000s, and the period after the global financial crisis in 2008. These 25 years show sufficient variation in the business cycle. In particular, as our data cover the period of the 2008 financial crisis, we can assess how wage inequality in Japan during this period would have been different without the change in employment practices in the late 1990s.====Furthermore, we employ a relatively new decomposition, the Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (FFL) decomposition method (Firpo, Fortin, Lemieux, 2007, Firpo et al., 2011). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply this method in the context of the business cycle and wage inequality. During 1989–2013, workers’ and firms’ attributes changed so drastically that it was indispensable to prevent the estimated change in the wage response to the business cycle from being contaminated by the huge changes in workers’ and firms’ attributes. The idea behind the FFL decomposition method is to combine the DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (DFL) decomposition method proposed by DiNardo et al. (1996) with the OaxacaBlinder (OB) decomposition method to estimate the contribution that each covariate makes to each of the structural and composition effects when analyzing distributional change. This is made possible by using the re-centered influence function (RIF) of ==== as the dependent variable. In the first stage of the FFL, distributional changes in wages are divided into change due to changes in ==== (i.e., a structural effect) and that due to changes in ==== (i.e., a composition effect). In the second stage, the two components are subdivided into the contribution of each explanatory variable by using novel RIF regressions. These regressions directly estimate the impact of the explanatory variables on the distributional statistic of interest. Thus, the FFL decomposition enables us to analyze whether a change in the wage response to the business cycle is statistically significant by each quantile of the wage distribution controlling for changes in workers’ and firms’ attributes.====In this study, we first present a hypothesis based on Japan’s segmented labor market. Originally, low-income earners who are likely to belong to the secondary sector were vulnerable to changes in the economic conditions before the change in employment practices. However, since firms became more aggressive toward downsizing during the late 1990s, employment adjustment has dominated wage adjustment. Our empirical results from the FFL decomposition are consistent with the hypothesis. The wage response to the business cycle became weaker after 1997, and the degree of change was largest at the 10th quantile. Furthermore, the DFL decomposition provides us a counterfactual distribution that represents what the wage distribution would have been if the pre-1997 employment practices were maintained during the 2008 financial crisis. From the analyses, we confirm that wages at the 10th quantile would have fallen more if not for the change in employment practices in 1997. This finding suggests that the change contributed to mitigating wage inequality in the subsequent recessions.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we explain the structural changes in the labor market in Japan in 1997, and Section 3 provides the hypothesis based on Japan’s segmented labor market. Section 4 describes the FFL decomposition method. Section 5 presents the data. Section 6 reports the empirical results, and Section 7 discusses several robustness checks.

The results show that workers who are older, have children, who work as temporary staff or at small companies, all of whom have less access to firm-provided training, are also less likely to initiate worker-financed training at least in part due to long work hours which limits participation. On the other hand, workers who receive firm-provided training at the workplace or even informal guidance from their supervisors about specific required skills are more likely to also participate in worker-financed training, suggesting that experiences at the workplace can affect a worker’s self-learning activities outside of work. Additionally, we found that although participation in worker-financed training tends not to lead to any short-term increase in wages or job changes, it can lead to positive effects on a person’s working life through improved job skills or job tasks, which suggests that it might have positive effects in the workplace in the long run.","In recent years, continuing education has become an important policy issue in developed countries as the acquisition of knowledge and continual upgrading of skills has become an essential strategy for surviving and thriving in a knowledge-based economy.==== In Japan, even though a shrinking working-age population has increased the importance of a well-educated labor force, Japanese workers since the 2000s have had fewer opportunities to improve their work-related skills at the workplace.==== This is due to an ongoing structural change in the Japanese labor market associated with the decades-long economic downturn and gradual dismantling of the lifetime employment system that has led to more than one third of the labor force now working as non-regular employees under fixed-term contracts or on a part-time basis.==== However, this phenomenon is not unique to Japan and has also been observed in other OECD countries as well and, further, this increasing flexibility in the structure of the labor market has been shown to be negatively correlated with work-related skill development in many advanced economies.==== Due to these societal changes, self-financed continuing education is expected to become increasingly important in many countries.====The importance of continuing education for a contemporary labor force is already broadly recognized, with promotional policies having been in place in some countries since the 1990s. In Japan, for example, the ==== (==== in Japanese) was introduced in 1998 under the ==== to provide direct financial support to individuals for worker-financed training. This system is a co-financed voucher program that pays an employment insurance benefit to reimburse a portion of the costs incurred by individuals who take up and complete at their own expense a job training course designated by the Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare. More recently, the ==== (==== in Japanese) was introduced in October 2014, providing an even larger subsidy to workers who undertake professional or practical training at approved educational organizations, including graduate schools.====However, even though continuing education has become an increasingly important feature of human resource development in contemporary advanced economies, little is known about its determinants or effects because of its broad and complex nature, consisting of all learning opportunities throughout a person’s life that foster the continuous development and improvement of the knowledge and skills needed for employment and personal fulfillment. Accordingly, this study concentrates on work-related continuing education, of which there are two main types available to workers: formal or informal training provided by a firm during work hours (====), and training initiated by workers themselves to improve job-related skills and knowledge outside of work hours at their own expense (====). As firm-provided training has been researched extensively,==== this study focuses on worker-financed training (==== in Japanese), using a unique Japanese worker dataset.====The literature on worker-financed training in Japan remains in its infancy, with the few extant studies providing only a rudimentary understanding of its determinants and effects. Kurosawa (2001), analyzing microdata from establishments in the industrial district of Kitakyushu in the southern part of Japan, finds that worker-financed training does not affect wages significantly, and Yoshida (2004), using panel data on Japanese women and the Heckman et al. (1997) difference-in-differences (DD) non-parametric matching extension procedure, finds limited evidence of a positive impact of worker-financed training.==== This study differs from these previous studies in that the dataset includes both male and female workers and covers all city areas nationwide. Further, we examine both the determinants and effects of worker-financed training from a broad perspective using a wide range of outcome variables: wage growth, changes in job skills, changes in job tasks, and job mobility.====For the purposes of this study, worker-financed training is defined as any work-related learning activity undertaken after completing full-time education and entering the labor market. The analysis sample consists of Japanese people aged 25–44 who are labor force participants and not unemployed.==== As worker-financed training is a form of continuing adult education, with participants worldwide and of global policy relevance, the results of this study are relevant not only to Japan but are applicable generally.====The other characteristics of the study are as follows. First, when estimating the effect of worker-financed training, we apply a growth estimation model to control for any potential unobserved individual heterogeneity, meaning that growth in wages, job skills and job tasks are taken as the dependent variables to eliminate any individual specific factor fixed over time. This approach, which is crucial for measuring the effects of job training, is explained in detail in Section 5.1. However, while this method is effective in controlling for time-==== heterogeneity, it may not be able to control for time-==== unobserved heterogeneity. To the extent that this is true, the estimates in this study might have an upward bias, with the results best interpreted as defining the upper bound of any worker-financed training effect. However, we address this concern by controlling for the proxy variable of basic academic skills==== because it can be assumed that changes in economic outcomes caused by participation in training might be higher for an individual with high basic skills than one with low skills.====Second, the dataset employed in this study, the ====, is particularly informative relative to the literature. The ==== includes questions about educational history, work history and life events ==== after graduation from junior high school, providing a panel structure that allows us to control for any time-invariant unobserved effects as well as information about workers prior to training.==== This pre-training information is important, as Heckman et al. (1997) point out that the DD non-parametric matching extension procedure requires that the treatment and control groups need to be constructed to be as equal as possible, and this dataset allows us to do this. Additionally, as the ==== includes information not only on wages but also on many other outcome variables such as skill development, job tasks and job changes, this allows us to provide a much more comprehensive picture of the effects of worker-financed training than the extant literature.====Lastly, in addition to analyzing the ==== of worker-financed training, this study also examines its ====, which is important from a policy perspective. Although continuing education may be important, we must work to ensure that there is an equal opportunity to partake in it, for the opportunity is likely to be strongly biased in favor of the more advantaged members of the labor market. Therefore, this study examines which workers are more/less likely to participate in worker-financed training. Further, it is well known in economics that ==== is an important motivating factor for a wide range of economic activities, so this study also explores the effects of information by identifying which workplace environments are likely to promote worker-financed training.====The main findings of the study are as follows: firstly, workers at small companies and temp staff are not likely to participate in worker-financed training, suggesting that those who have less access to firm-provided training are also less likely to undertake self-initiated and privately-funded work-related continuing education.==== Secondly, workers who have received either formal firm-provided training or informal guidance from their supervisors about required skills at the workplace are more likely to engage in worker-financed training, which implies that this work-related continuing education is not completely unrelated to experiences at the workplace but is affected by information received there. Thirdly, those who work long hours are least likely to participate in worker-financed training, so relaxing these time constraints could be critical for encouraging more working people to take up this activity. Fourthly, after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, we do not find that worker-financed training leads to any statistically significant ==== increase in wages but, because it may improve job skills and job tasks, worker-financed training could lead to wage increases in the future. Finally, worker-financed training does not typically cause workers to change jobs in the ==== run because the skills acquired are likely to have a large general component.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Service firms have fewer product innovations than manufacturing firms do, but the productivity of innovative service firms is very high. Service firms have a low propensity to hold patents, but their holding of trade secrets is comparable to that of manufacturing firms. Product/service innovations have positive relationships with holding patents and trade secrets in both industries, but a positive association of process innovations is found only with holding trade secrets in the manufacturing industry.","This study, using Japanese firm-level data, presents empirical evidence on innovation in the service sector and the role of patents and trade secrets in innovation. In advanced countries including Japan, service industries account for more than 70% of GDP, and improving their productivity is crucial to increasing the growth potential of the overall economy. While numerous factors affect the productivity of industries and firms, innovation is one of the fundamental drivers of productivity growth. However, innovation in the service sector has not been subjected to sufficient empirical analysis in Japan or in other advanced economies. Cohen (2010), in a comprehensive survey of empirical studies of innovation, states that “a major lacuna in our understanding of the determinants of innovative activity and performance is our virtual ignorance of innovation in the service sector.”==== Here, we present novel findings about innovation in service firms in comparison with that in manufacturing firms.====In general, manufacturing firms are far more active in terms of formal R&D investment than are firms in the service sector. According to the basic survey of Japanese business structure and activities (Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry: METI), the mean R&D intensity (R&D expenditure/sales) of service firms in 2013 was 0.35%, less than a third of the mean R&D intensity of manufacturing firms (1.29%).==== However, innovation is not limited to the development of new products/services through formal R&D investment. According to the current guidelines for internationally comparable innovation surveys, “innovation” includes 1) products, 2) processes, 3) organizational innovations, and 4) marketing innovations (OECD, 2005).====The Japanese Innovation Survey 2012 (National Institute of Science and Technology Policy, 2014) indicates that the percentages of firms that invested in the four types of innovations between fiscal years 2009 and 2011 were 1) 15.8% (new businesses), 2) 15.6% (new products/services), 3) 28.3% (product/service improvements), and 4) 22.5% (new production/delivery methods). Innovations other than new product development are thus frequent.====Although the R&D intensity of service firms, on average, is lower than that of manufacturing firms, these broadly defined innovations may play important roles in productivity improvements in the service industries. In fact, recent productivity studies argue that we should focus more on “soft innovations” related to human resources, organizational change, and other intangible investments when analyzing innovations in the service sector (Jorgenson and Timmer, 2011, Timmer et al., 2011).====Using an original firm survey, along with government statistics, this study presents empirical findings on innovative activities in the service sector and the role of patents and trade secrets in innovation, particularly in comparison with that in the manufacturing sector. The major research questions of this study are whether the relationship between innovative activities and firm performance differs between the service and manufacturing sectors and whether patents and trade secrets play an important role in service innovations.====This study offers three novel contributions. First, our data cover a large number of service firms, which enables us to compare the manufacturing and service industries. Second, the study covers new product/service development as well as improvements to existing products/services and the adoption of new production or delivery methods. Third, we use an accurate objective measure of holding trade secrets based on whether a firm has the “Trade Secret Management Rule.”====The major findings of this study are as follows. First, service firms have fewer product innovations than manufacturing firms do, but the productivity of innovative service firms is very high. Second, service firms have a low propensity to hold patents, but their holding of trade secrets is comparable to that of manufacturing firms. Third, product/service innovation has a positive relationship with the possession of patents and trade secrets in both the manufacturing and the service sectors. However, a positive relationship between process innovation and the possession of trade secrets is found only in the manufacturing sector.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly explains the institutional background in Japan and reviews the literature. Section 3 provides the analytical framework and hypotheses of the study. Section 4 explains the data and method of analysis. Section 5 reports and interprets the empirical results.

Our counterfactuals suggest that all current mega-regional scenarios have the potential to generate significant export gains for Asian economies, but that welfare improvements are much lower relative to baseline. This finding suggests a political economy problem, as trade-related reallocations of labor and capital would have to be justified politically on the basis of relatively small improvements in real GDP. Second, our simulations show that market size matters for mega-regionals: ","With the signature of the hastily renamed Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in March 2018, mega-regional trade deals are again near the top of the trade policy agenda in Asia. In the presence of an unpredictable US trade regime, efforts to promote further integration within Asia over the medium term gain greater political attractiveness. From an economic point of view, mega-regionals also have the potential virtue of harmonizing and simplifying rules across a range of fragmented agreements, thus reducing the famous “noodle bowl” effect (e.g., Kawai and Wignaraja, 2009).====Within Asia, four initiatives are of particular interest. The first is the CPTPP itself. The second relates to the hope—still alive in some quarters—that the USA might be induced at some point to rejoin the agreement it itself pushed for before abandoning. We term that scenario CPTPP12. Whereas the CPTPP's predecessor, TPP, was led by the US until its decision to withdraw under the Trump administration, the other two mega-regional initiatives in Asia involve China in a strong leadership role. The first is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), centered on ASEAN, but designed to consolidate and unify the network of agreements that has grown up around that organization, and which currently involves China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and Japan. The final initiative is the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP), which would potentially involve all members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Although an FTAAP-like initiative has long been floated in policy circles, China was the motivating force behind the decision taken by APEC members in 2014—China's host year— to launch a strategic study on issues related to FTAAP.====A final initiative that should be of interest to Asian countries, even though it does not involve them, is the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Although progress has been limited to date, the possibility of concluding such an agreement in the medium term cannot be excluded. Of interest to Asian countries is the prospect that their firms will have to compete on differential terms with European rivals in the large US market, and similarly with US firms in the European market. These two large markets are important destinations of Asian exports, and as such there is the potential for substantial trade effects if they decide to integrate.====With the exception of CPTPP, which now has a definitive text, the other initiatives—CPTPP12, RCEP, FTAAP, and TTIP—remain somewhat speculative. FTAAP and CPTPP12 are the most uncertain, as negotiations are not yet underway, and in the latter case may never happen at all. RCEP and TTIP have seen some level of negotiating activity, but progress has hit roadblocks in both cases. While TTIP is unlikely to proceed under the current US administration, that factor, as well as the signature of CPTPP, will perhaps give a fillip to the RCEP negotiations. In any case, these policy issues need to remain on the radar of Asian policymakers for the time being.====Against that background, it is important to know what the trade and welfare implications of the different agreements are for Asian countries, ranging from high income countries like Korea and Japan, to lower income members of ASEAN. That is the task this paper undertakes in a transparent and tractable way, which is nonetheless highly informative in terms of the relative dynamics of different scenarios. We exploit recent developments in the trade literature to estimate and simulate a simple but theoretically-grounded model of bilateral trade based on the structural gravity model (Anderson and Van Wincoop, 2003, Anderson and Van Wincoop, 2004), combined with the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator (Santos Silva and Tenreyro, 2006). This approach has been termed GE PPML (Anderson et al., 2015, Yotov et al., 2017). It provides a consistent platform for estimating parameters of interest, and for conducting counterfactual simulations, thus avoiding the need to estimate elasticities in one setting (an econometric model) but conduct trade and welfare simulations in a completely different framework (a computable general equilibrium, CGE, model), often built on different theoretical foundations.====A number of previous papers have modeled the effects of particular mega-regional initiatives in Asia. Kim et al. (2013) use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to consider the impacts of FTAAP on member and non-member economies. They consider tariff liberalization, reduction in services barriers, and improved trade facilitation; however, their data on services, for example, is based on an analysis of Uruguay Round commitments, which are typically much more restrictive than observed policies. They do not provide fresh estimates of services barriers. Similarly, their approach to trade facilitation is not strictly data driven, but simply assumes a given reduction in trade costs. Taking these points together, a key limitation is that this work is not based on an empirical estimate of the ways in which trade agreements have historically affected either trade costs or trade flows, but instead on assumptions as to what is likely.====Petri and Plummer (2016) similarly use a CGE model to examine the impacts of the then current TPP proposal, which we refer to here as CPTPP12. They consider reductions of tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers in goods, and non-tariff barriers in services. In the latter case, they use estimates of service sector restrictiveness due to Fontagne et al. (2011) as their baseline, and assume that the agreement would reduce particular percentages of the total number of restrictions, subject to minimum level of barriers that is assumed to reflect necessary regulatory provisions. As in the case of Kim et al., 2013, Petri and Plummer, 2016 do not directly assess the impact of trade agreements on trade costs or trade flows based on historical experience, but instead move forward from assumptions as to what CPTPP12 would be likely to do.====Petri et al. (2017) use CGE modeling to compare various scenarios of Asian integration following the US decision to withdraw from TPP. For current purposes, their analysis of RCEP is particularly relevant. They use a similar model to that of Petri and Plummer (2016) to analyze these scenarios, and so our comments above apply with equal force.====We build on the existing literature in two main ways. The first is methodological, as set out in the previous paragraph. Concretely, we demonstrate that readily available data and straightforward programming can yield a flexible and informative platform that brings estimation and simulation closer together than is possible within a CGE framework. We use exactly the same data for estimation that we use for reproducing the model's baseline equilibrium, which is not typically the case in CGE models. In addition, our approach does not require extensive collected data on non-tariff barriers in goods and services, which is frequently unavailable. Overall, we expect our approach to be of significant interest to applied researchers and policy professionals in Asia. Second, our analysis of different scenarios proceeds from a concrete analysis of the effects of trade agreements all around the world on trade in goods and services. We derive our impact assessments from estimates of the impacts of trade agreements, not from assumptions about how their terms will affect various estimated inputs into the model, as in the case of the CGE estimates above. Third, we conduct counterfactual simulations of the main mega-regional initiatives—CPTPP, CPTPP12, RCEP, FTAAP, and TTIP—at the aggregate level (combining goods and services), then separately for agricultural products, manufactured goods, services, and final and intermediate manufactured goods. The latter simulations are important for understanding the implications of mega-regionals for value chain activity: a greater proportion of intermediates in manufactured goods trade following passage of an agreement would be consistent with the deepening of value chains, which rely heavily on the internationalization of production and frequent and intense movements of intermediates. To our knowledge, the value chain dimension has not been addressed at all by the existing literature on mega-regionals.====A core finding of our analysis, which sits well with previous work, is that Asian mega-regionals are beneficial in trade and welfare terms to participants, and do not have significant negative effects on non-participants. The same is largely true for Asian countries with respect to TTIP. Second, we find that the benefits of a mega-regional are larger the broader its membership base, and in particular according to whether or not it includes China. As such, FTAAP has the largest impact of any of the agreements we consider, as it includes all large Asia-Pacific markets except India, which is comparatively less open to trade than most other Asian countries.====There is evidence of sectoral heterogeneity in terms of the estimated impact of a trade agreement on trade flows, which turns into differences in estimated counterfactual impacts. The manufacturing sector sees the strongest impact of a trade agreement, followed by agriculture, and then services. This result is interesting because services are clearly the frontier for most comprehensive trade agreements: one implication of our finding is that the services provisions of trade agreements are relatively less effective than those dealing with goods, which partly reflects the difficulty of negotiating market access for intangibles where barriers come in the form of complex regulations rather than simple discriminatory taxes.====Our results are most novel in the area of value chains. We find that trade agreements tend to promote trade in intermediates more strongly than trade in final goods. As a result, our counterfactuals in all cases show a shift towards a greater proportion of intermediates in total exports. Changes are relatively small for most countries, but large in some scenarios for China and Japan, perhaps equivalent to five years of deepening value chain activity based on what has been observed in recent years worldwide. As a result, we conclude that Asian mega-regionals have considerable scope to deepen value chains in the region.====In line with previous work, we find that mega-regionals can have substantial trade effects, but limited welfare implications. Taking our results on aggregate goods and services trade as a benchmark, we find sometimes large trade effects, such as a 13% increase in exports for Japan under FTAAP, but the largest impact on real GDP is only 0.19%, for Australia-New Zealand under FTAAP. This difference in size between trade and welfare effects suggests that the political economy of mega-regionals may continue to be challenging: the larger welfare gains reported in the CGE literature typically rely on aspects of the agreement that are harder to quantify, such as dynamic growth effects driven by investment decisions, but the displacement effects due to large export and import effects are well known and easy to observe in practice. This disjuncture was part of the political economy story behind the US decision to withdraw from TPP, and suggests that at least some Asian countries will find it difficult to move forward on mega-regionals in the short term.====Against this background, the paper proceeds as follows. The next section discusses our dataset. Section 3 presents the econometric model, and discusses the simulation methodology. Section 4 presents results, focusing first on econometric estimates, then simulation results. The final section concludes and discusses policy implications.","Mega-regional trade agreements and Asia: An application of structural gravity to goods, services, and value chains",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158318300418,March 2019,2019,Research Article,133.0

The obtained results reveal the following three facts. First, Asian stock markets, which were globally integrated before the global financial crisis, began to be regionally integrated thereafter. Second, the US-to-Asia spillover is the largest among global-to-Asia spillovers during the sample period. Third, the degree of the Asia-to-Japan spillback is comparable to that of the Japan-to-Asia spillover.====This paper also investigates which and how policy and economic factors affect one-way US-to-Asia and Japan-to-Asia spillovers in a panel regression, particularly under conventional and unconventional ====. The regression results show that both conventional and unconventional monetary easing can increase these spillovers. However, the degree of their increases depends on the monetary policy instruments, combination of these instruments, and investors’ risk appetite and their sensitivity to the risks. To mitigate the external financial shocks induced by these root causes, for Asian markets, the restriction of capital inflows can be an effective prevention tool.","This paper examines whether Asian stock markets are integrated with global and regional markets by assessing financial spillovers. International financial spillovers reflect the impact of changes in foreign equity prices on domestic equity prices. They can be driven by news on economic fundamentals as well as contagion arising from financial friction. In both cases, the presence of common investors in two countries can raise the bilateral spillovers between two countries even if there are no linkages between their real economies. The spillover is caused by the portfolio rebalancing performed by large institutional investors in the face of relative performance concerns that may propagate shocks. The fire sale, wake-up call, and herding effects displayed by international investors may cause this phenomenon. Moreover, when the funds in question are invested in a country, the inclusion of this country's equity price as one of its benchmark indices may be an important factor in determining international spillovers.====Existing studies that have used a broad range of methodologies have failed to reach a robust consensus on financial integration in Asia. Jang and Sul, 2002, Yang et al., 2003, and Borensztein and Loungani (2011) revealed that Asian stock markets began to be integrated with global markets after the Asian financial crisis. Yu et al. (2010) and Boubakri and Guillaumin (2015) found that while East Asian stock markets were regionally segmented before the global financial crisis (GFC), they began to be regionally integrated thereafter. However, Komatsubara et al. (2017) revealed that regional integration in Asia excluding China started after the Asian financial crisis, whereas that including China started after the GFC. Moreover, Fukuda and Tanaka (2017) showed empirically that the financial spillover from Asia became large in the post-GFC period.====Under these circumstances, the global concern is not only “dominant” global financial spillovers from advanced to emerging countries but also “growing and not negligible” spillovers from emerging to advanced countries. The increase in the latter, called “financial spillbacks,” can be caused by excess portfolio investment in emerging market economies. The Global Financial Stability Report (IMF, 2016) referred to the growing importance of financial spillbacks for advanced countries to determine relevant monetary policies for successful normalization. However, studies of the time-varying drivers of global spillovers and spillbacks are lacking. Thus, this paper focuses on nine Asian stock markets to understand (1) the relative importance of global and intraregional spillovers, (2) the evolution of Asian spillbacks over time, (3) the effects of the United States and Japan's unconventional monetary policy measures (e.g., quantitative easing; QE) on the global transmission channel, and (4) the required macroeconomic and financial conditions to mitigate external financial shocks as a receiver of global liquidity.====This paper uses the method proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014) to compare the magnitude of return spillovers in East Asian stock markets as well as evaluate structural changes in the spillover mechanism among countries. Yilmaz (2010) and Fujiwara and Takahashi (2012) demonstrated the huge surge in stock return spillovers in East Asian stock markets during the GFC by adopting the first version of Diebold and Yilmaz's (2009) spillover measure. By using the second version proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014) and IMF (2016) confirmed the role of emerging market economies as a net source of financial shocks. In addition, Guimaraes-Filho and Hong (2016) showed the growing importance of China as a driver of Asian financial market dynamics, particularly since August 2015, by using Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014) method. Recent studies have documented growing financial spillovers from emerging to global markets. However, they have not clarified how these financial spillbacks occurred. Thus, this paper tries to reveal the transmission mechanism of mutual or one-way spillovers among Asian emerging markets including China and global markets by examining the impact of global (i.e., the United States and Japan) QE as well as tapering on emerging markets.====Most existing research on the drivers of financial spillovers, such as Aizenman et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2014, Mishra et al., 2014, Rai and Suchanek, 2014, Neely, 2015, Estrada et al., 2016, and Fratzscher et al. (2018) have used the event study approach to examine the effect of the announcement of both QE and tapering. Bauer and Neely (2014) also used the event study approach and Gaussian dynamic term structure models to investigate the relative importance of signaling and portfolio balance channels for international effects originating from the large-scale asset purchases in 2008 and 2009 by the US Federal Reserve (US Fed hereafter). However, only a few researches like Chen et al. (2014) and Fratzscher et al. (2018) have explored the direct relationship between the magnitudes of financial spillovers and quantitative degrees of changes in QE and tapering.====As another methodology, Dekle and Hamada, 2015, Georgiadis, 2016 and Okimoto and Inoue (2017) used the global vector autoregressive (VAR) model, while Chen et al. (2016) used the global vector error correction model to examine the impact of QE in Japan or the United States on emerging and other advanced economies. However, these two approaches could neither produce an interdependent matrix among the respective countries nor capture the dynamic properties of this matrix because they included few countries in their investigations. Chowdhury, 1994, Ng, 2000, Miyakoshi, 2003, Yang et al., 2003, and Fukuda (2018) applied a multivariate GARCH model to depict the short-run dynamics of stock returns and showed the interlinkages of Asian stock markets. However, this model is not designed to capture time-varying mutual transmissions among financial markets in a wide range of countries (e.g., more than 10 countries). Bowman et al. (2015) used panel data to investigate the effects of US unconventional monetary policies on stock prices in emerging market economies. However, such data cannot account for the time-varying relationships of stock prices among emerging economies.====This paper uses both conventional and unconventional monetary policy variables (i.e., the policy rates and current accounts of the US Fed and Bank of Japan (BOJ)) in the regression of the estimated spillovers to confirm these policy changes that may affect the spillovers in addition to the announcement effect. The panel regressions of these spillovers are also considered to examine which pull and push factors of capital flows should contribute to diminishing the impact of external shocks.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses global dependence and regional interdependence among Asian financial markets. Section 3 explains the spillover index proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014) as well as our revisions of their index and discusses the results of our estimation of global and regional return spillovers for Asian stock markets.

Taken together, our analyses of these two datasets show that precautionary saving plays a relatively important role in explaining the lower than expected wealth decumulation rate of the retired elderly, at least in the case of Japan, even though both precautionary saving and bequest motives are important drivers behind this puzzle. Our results also suggest the possibility that the financial burden of parental care may also affect the wealth decumulation behavior of the retired elderly in Japan. Given that parental care responsibilities tend to arise relatively late in life, often after retirement, in the case of Japan, our results suggest that the financial burden of parental care may be a relevant issue when analyzing the wealth decumulation behavior of the elderly.","Japan had one of the highest household saving rates among the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) until the mid-1980 s,==== but her household saving rate has been declining steadily since the mid-1970 s and has been very low (sometimes even negative) during the last 15 years (Horioka, 2017). One of the main driving forces behind this observed trend in the household saving rate is population aging (e.g., Horioka, 1997). According to the simplest version of the life-cycle model, people accumulate wealth during their working lives and decumulate their wealth after retirement in order to smooth consumption over the life cycle. Thus, theory predicts that saving rates should decline as population aging progresses, and Japan's recent experience is fully consistent with this theoretical prediction.====However, what is puzzling is that, although the link between population aging and aggregate trends in household saving rates predicted by the life-cycle model has been verified empirically in the case of Japan (e.g., Horioka, 1997), the wealth decumulation rates (the ratios of dissaving to the stock of wealth) of the retired elderly in Japan are lower than those implied by the basic life-cycle model with no bequest motives and no longevity risk. For example, Horioka (2010) and Horioka and Niimi (2017) find that the wealth decumulation rates of the retired elderly in Japan have been only 1 to 3% per year during the last 15 years when wealth is measured as financial net worth, even though they have shown a slight upward trend over time. These low wealth decumulation rates imply that many die with significant wealth. Moreover, almost 70% of total financial wealth is held by households whose heads are aged 60 or above in Japan,==== and more than 90% of financial net worth is held by such households. These figures show that the lion's share of financial assets in Japan is held by the elderly and underscore the importance of understanding the wealth decumulation behavior of this age group.====The wealth decumulation rates of the elderly have been found to be lower than predicted by the basic life-cycle model not only in Japan but in other countries as well, and several alternative explanations have been put forward to explain this puzzle, including precautionary saving and bequest motives. However, the empirical literature has not yet reached a consensus on the relative importance of the different explanations, and there is scope for more work to disentangle precautionary saving motives from other motives, including bequest motives (De Nardi et al., 2016). Furthermore, previous work on the wealth decumulation behavior of the elderly has been conducted predominantly using data on the United States (US), and there are only a handful studies that look at the case of Japan.====Using micro data from two household surveys, this paper analyzes the determinants of the wealth decumulation behavior of the retired elderly in Japan with the goal of identifying possible explanations for why their rate of wealth decumulation is lower than predicted by the basic life-cycle model. In so doing, our paper attempts to fill the aforementioned gaps in the literature by making three key contributions. First, it attempts to assess the relative importance of precautionary saving and bequest motives in explaining the wealth decumulation behavior of the retired elderly. Despite growing efforts to overcome the challenge of assessing the relative importance of precautionary saving and bequest motives in recent years, more work remains to be done (De Nardi et al., 2016). Moreover, we also examine the implications of different types of bequest motives for the wealth decumulation behavior of the retired elderly by exploiting detailed information on the nature of bequest motives that these households have.====Second, this paper looks at the case of Japan where empirical work on the reasons behind the low wealth decumulation rate of the elderly remains limited. It would be interesting to see whether previous findings obtained mostly for the US and European countries also hold in the case of Japan where the institutional setting and social norms differ from those in these countries. Japan has a universal mandatory health insurance program==== and also introduced a mandatory long-term care insurance (LTCI) program==== with universal and relatively generous coverage in 2000. Another unique feature of Japan is that elderly care has traditionally taken place within the family setting. While there is some evidence that perceived filial obligations have been declining among adult children since the launch of the LTCI program (e.g., Tsutsui et al., 2014), some studies find that informal care by adult children continues to be the most common source of caregiving for the elderly in Japan (Hanaoka and Norton, 2008, Long et al., 2009).====Third, this paper investigates the implications of the financial burden of parental care for the wealth decumulation behavior of the retired elderly. While much attention has so far been paid in the literature to the implications of their own long-term care needs for the wealth decumulation rate of the elderly, there has not been any previous research that takes into account the financial burden of parental care when analyzing the wealth decumulation behavior of the elderly. This is a particularly relevant issue in Japan where parental care needs tend to arise relatively late in people's lives because of the high life expectancy in the country. The share of cases in which both the care recipient and his/her main family caregiver are aged 65 or above is as high as about 55%, and the share of cases in which both are aged 75 or above is about 30%.==== As far as we know, this is the first paper to analyze the implications of the financial burden of parental care for the wealth decumulation behavior of the retired elderly.====We use two different datasets for our empirical analysis―the Survey on Households and Saving conducted by the Yu-cho Foundation and the Preference Parameters Study conducted by Osaka University. Both datasets contain unique information that will allow us to shed light on the relative importance of the alternative explanations for the lower than expected wealth decumulation rate of the retired elderly.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In response, various firms around the world have experienced increasing pressure to increase the number of women on corporate boards. Many countries are encouraging and even requiring firms to appoint more women on their boards. For example, in 2003, Norway enacted a law requiring all listed firms to increase the proportion of women on the boards to 40% by 2008.==== Most of these policy initiatives are based on the view that women serving on corporate boards can affect the quality of corporate governance (Adams and Ferreira, 2009, Green and Homroy, 2018).====There is a growing body of literature that investigates female directors on corporate boards.

Some studies report a significant and positive relation between female directors and firm performance (e.g., Carter et al., 2003, Dezsö and Ross, 2012, Liu et al., 2014, Low et al., 2015, Nguyen et al., 2015). Other studies report a significant and negative relation (e.g., Adams and Ferreira, 2009) or fail to find a significant relation (e.g., Carter et al., 2010, Gregory-Smith et al., 2013). Furthermore, the extant literature on the stock market reactions to the appointments of female directors also produces mixed evidence. The market reactions to female director appointments are significantly positive (e.g., Campbell and Vera, 2010; Kang et al., 2010, Adams et al., 2012) or are insignificant (Farrell and Hersch, 2005).==== In sum, the further analysis of female representation on corporate boards is an important task.====In this paper, I provide a comprehensive analysis of female directors on corporate boards using a large sample of Japanese firms. In this analysis, I ask the following questions. First, what types of firms are more likely to have women on their boards? Second, how does female board representation affect firm performance?====To address these questions, using a sample of Japanese firms has the advantage that it is easier to identify the effect of female representation on corporate boards. The representation of women on corporate boards in Japan is much lower than that in the US, European countries, and other Asian countries. The percentage of women on corporate boards was 18.7% in the US, 26.1% in the UK, 21.9% in Australia, 12.9% in China, and 7.7% in Singapore. (Korn Ferry, 2016). However, according to the 2017 edition of the Executive Officer Listing (Yakuin Shikiho) by Toyo Keizai Inc. (Toyo Keizai Shinposha), the percentage of women on the boards of publicly traded Japanese firms was only approximately 3.7% in 2017.==== Because women are highly underrepresented on Japanese corporate boards, the effect of female representation on corporate boards is expected to be larger in Japan than that in other countries. Although prior studies produce mixed results, I can obtain clear results using a sample of publicly traded Japanese firms.====Using a sample of unbalanced panel data from approximately 2000 publicly traded Japanese firms over the period 2006–2015, I first examine the determinants of women on corporate boards. In particular, I classify female directors into inside and outside directors and investigate the determinants of each director type separately. I find significant differences between these director types. Younger and smaller firms with larger boards, higher managerial ownership, and smaller foreign operations are more likely to have female inside directors. In contrast, larger firms with more outside directors, many younger directors, higher foreign ownership, smaller foreign operations, and lower growth prospects are more likely to have female outside directors.====Next, I examine whether female board representation is significantly associated with firm performance. I use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models and find that female directors are significantly and positively associated with firm performance, as measured by Tobin's Q, after controlling for other firm characteristics as well as industry and year fixed effects. Both female inside and outside directors lead to higher firm performance, indicating that regardless of director types, female directors play a role in enhancing firm performance. However, the results of the OLS regressions are likely to be subject to endogenous concerns arising from unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneity, and the dynamic relations between current values of the female directors and past values of the firm performance. To address these endogeneity concerns, I employ a dynamic panel general method of moments (GMM) estimator developed by a series of prior studies (e.g., Arrellano and Bover, 1995, Blundell and Bond, 1998). I find that female outside directors are significantly and positively associated with firm performance after fully addressing these endogeneity issues. However, female inside directors are not significantly related to firm performance.====However, the results of the regression models are likely to be subject to sample selection bias. To address this concern, I implement a propensity score matching estimator, originally developed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). The results of the matching estimators indicate that firms with female outside directors exhibit higher performance than comparable firms without female outside directors. The results are consistent with those in the regressions models.====Finally, I use standard event study methodology to examine the stock market reactions to the appointments of new female outside directors. The results from the event study suggest that on average the market reacts positively to the appointments of new female outside directors. The results indicate that shareholders view the appointments of female outside directors as beneficial.====This study makes three contributions to the extant literature. First, to the best of my knowledge, this study is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of gender diversity on Japanese corporate boards. Although female representation on Japanese corporate boards has been actively debated, prior studies are very limited (Siegel and Kodama, 2011, Morikawa, 2016, Niikura and Seko, 2017). Second, although a large body of literature investigates the effect of female directors on corporate boards, few prior studies perform an analysis of director types, i.e., inside and outside directors, probably because most of the female directors in these samples are independent (outside) directors (e.g., Farrell and Hersch, 2005, Adams and Ferreira, 2009). However, whether the effect of female directors is likely to be driven by inside directors and/or outside directors is unclear. By dividing female directors into inside and outside directors, I find significant differences between these director types.==== Third, prior studies focusing on Japanese firms find a significant relation between female directors and firm performance, but these studies do not fully address potential endogeneity concerns (Siegel and Kodama, 2011, Niikura and Seko, 2017). I pay special attention to different endogeneity issues in empirical corporate finance research and find a significant relation between female directors and firm performance after fully addressing any endogeneity issues.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the theoretical backgrounds and hypotheses regarding the causal relation between female directors and firm performance. Section 3 describes the sample and summary statistics. Section 4 provides empirical results. Section 5 concludes the paper.",Gender diversity on Japanese corporate boards,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158318300455,March 2019,2019,Research Article,136.0

This paper presents the evidence that the growth in imports from China positively affected manufacturing employment growth at the prefecture level in Japan. This result gives contrast to the finding of Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013, AER) for local labor markets in the United States. Furthermore, estimations with decomposed types of the imported goods suggest that an increase in intermediate imports attributes to the positive effects of import growth from China.","For many developed countries, the 1990s and the 2000s have been characterized by massive and rising imports from China (Mion and Zhu, 2013) and Japan has been no exception. Fig. 1 shows the change in the total amount of imported goods from China to Japan. In 1995, the total import value was nearly three trillion yen, which increased to about fifteen trillion yen in 2007. For a long time, the United States (U.S.) was Japan’s largest importing partner. In 2002, however, China overtook the U.S. Even after that switch, the Chinese import share keeps increasing while the U.S. share continues to decrease.====Trade data==== shows that the imports from middle-income and low-income countries have also grown during the same period. In particular, Asian countries are the primary source for this increase, and most of the growth attributed to the growth of China. Table 1 shows the change in the import values from China, low-income countries, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, and the world.==== Table 1 shows that the degree of the increase in the imports from low-income countries is over two times larger than that from all over the world, which implies that the growth rate of imports from low-income countries is much higher than that of the rest of the world. It is also notable that the imports from China account for over 80% of Japan’s imports from low-income countries during the sample period.====There may be two factors causing this deluge of China’s exports to Japan. One is China’s economic growth (Autor et al., 2013). In the last few decades, China experienced switching to a market economy, growing productivity and participating in the WTO in 2001 (see, e.g., Branstetter and Lardy, 2006). Through this process, China has become one of Japan’s most prominent suppliers and one of the largest consumers of Japanese products.====Another factor is that the Japanese economy has reinforced its relationship with the Chinese economy more and more since the 1990s, which is mainly because of outsourcing. Outsourcing from developed countries to China has contributed to the expansion of China’s trade activity (see Ijiri, Inui, Matsuura, 2010, Amiti, Freund, 2010). The vertical trade with Japan explains a large part of the expansion. In fact, in the last few decades, Japanese firms have accelerated their relocation to transfer parts of their production systems to China to reduce production costs. As stated in a report,==== 18% of Japanese firms produce overseas in the manufacturing sector, and 37% of them have a location in China.==== Even though Japan runs a persistent trade deficit with China, Japan’s exports to China have grown in the last two decades.====In this context, the increasing trade with low-wage countries made people afraid that it would affect the Japanese manufacturing sector adversely and decrease employment and production (Ito, 2005). Indeed, the Japanese manufacturing sector went through a tough period when the developing countries experienced a growth in export. The Census of Manufacture, which is provided by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), states that the number of manufacturing plants declined from about 435,000 in 1990 to about 224,000 in 2010, and the manufacturing employment share against all sectors’ employment has fallen from 22% to 14%. Then, did an increase in imports from China cause this decline in employment?====It is important to take into account regional industry agglomerations when we consider the relationship between trade and labor markets in the sense that different regions have different industrial structures. We can expect that the exposure to the increasing imports from China would be different by areas, and thus its effects on local workers also differ across the regions. Therefore, this paper complements previous studies that investigated the relationship between import competition and the labor market in Japan focusing on industries and firms.====This paper, therefore, examines how an increase in the imports from China has affected the Japanese manufacturing workers in the prefecture-level labor markets, employing the factor proportions model and the model built by Autor et al. (2013) as theoretical frameworks. This paper adopts the two-stage least squares estimation as an estimation strategy following Autor et al. (2013) to address endogeneity issues.====This paper has two main findings. First, the estimation result shows the evidence that the import growth from China positively affected the Japanese manufacturing employment in local labor markets, which contrasts with the evidence in Autor et al. (2013). This result is also different from the results in some other countries and in the previous literature using industry-level or firm-level employment data in Japan. The result is robust when I control the prefecture-level exports to China. The counterfactual estimate of the manufacturing employment when there was no import growth from China during the sample period is ==== million. Second, the estimation with the decomposed type of imported goods reveals that the positive impact of import growth from China on the manufacturing employment share is primarily due to the expansion in imports in intermediate inputs. These results imply that, in the manufacturing sector, the Japanese local labor markets as a whole has benefited from an increase in imports from China during the sample period, which is principally due to the imports of intermediate inputs. Possible explanations for this positive effect of imports from China would be positive spillovers industry-level positive impacts of imports in intermediate inputs and labor reallocation within a local labor market.",The effect of an increase in imports from China on local labor markets in Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158318300686,March 2019,2019,Research Article,137.0
